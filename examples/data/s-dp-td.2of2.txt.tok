  Previously , I wrote that I loved " Titanic " , cried at its ending ( many times over ) , and I 'm a guy in his 60 's . I also wondered about why this great movie , which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics , was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb . com users . Well , I looked at the breakdown of the user ratings . While 29.0 % of all votes gave it a 10 rating , 10.7 % gave it a 1 rating . These 10.7 % of these irrational imdb users , in effect , pulled the overall rating down to 7.0 . In my previous comments , I blamed this very unusual voting pattern ( a sudden surge in 1 ratings , with a high 10 rating , dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level ) on only one thing : hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio . Believe me , I 've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people ( young men , mostly ) , who defame him left and right . They absolutely hate the man , and they will have no part in giving him any credit in " Titanic " . ( To answer one other user : I am NOT talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much , and gave it a 5 or a 6 , etc . Everyone has , and is entitled to , his / her own taste . But no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for " Titanic " , pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings , is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture . ) Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of " Titanic " to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical " bombs " ( there are many more , but these 5 will prove my point ) . " Heaven 's Gate " ( 1980 ) was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing , and imdb voters ' ratings were : 23.2 % 10 ratings and 9.2 % 1 ratings ( overall rating of 6.1 ) . " Big Top Pee-wee " ( 1988 ) got 4.3 % 10 ratings and 9.9 % 1 ratings ( overall rating of 4.5 ) . " Cat People " ( 1982 ) got 6.1 % 10 ratings and 2.6 % 1 ratings ( overall rating of 5.8 ) . " Blind Date " ( 1987 ) got 3.0 % 10 ratings and 2.8 % 1 ratings ( overall rating of 5.3 ) . " Jumpin ' Jack Flash " ( 1986 ) got 4.4 % 10 ratings and 3.7 % 1 ratings ( overall rating of 5.2 ) . WHAT DO ALL OF THESE FILMS HAVE IN COMMON WITH " TITANIC " ? ALL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER ! THAN " TITANIC " , AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS EVER WAS NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE AWARD . Again , " Titanic " got 10.7 % 1 ratings ! Compare that to the other 5 movies I just mentioned . Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factor ?  
  I was prepared for a turgid talky soap opera cum travelogue , but was pleased to find a fast-paced script , an underlying moral , excellent portrayals from all the actors , especially Peter Finch , amazing special effects , suspense , and beautiful cinematography-there 's even a shot of the majestic stone Buddhas recently destroyed by the Taliban . Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic , before she gave in to the gaspy hysterics that marred her later work . All the supporting players round it out , and I do wonder who trained all those elephants . Speaking of the stone-Buddha sequence , you really can discern that it 's Vivien Leigh in the long shots . Her shape and the way she moves is distinct from Taylor 's . The only thing marring that sequence are the poorly done process shots , where the background moves by much too fast for horses at a walk . If you want a thought-provoking film that is beautiful to watch and never boring , spend a few hours with Elephant Walk .  
  One of the first OVA 's ( " original video animation " ) I ever bought , this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles . A cyberpunk sci-fi action comedy set against an unlikely ( for a comedy , that is ) background of near-future pollution in a dystopian society . The " heroes " of Dominion are the Tank Police , formed with a " if we can't beat crime , we 'll get bigger guns " philosophy , and who are , like the name suggests , patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars , and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch . Most , if not all , of these cops are borderline ( ? ) psychopaths and neurotics , giving new meaning to the phrase " loose cannons " . Equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries , terrorist Buaku and his hench ( wo ) men , the Twin Cat Sisters , whose existence always seems to involve giving the Tank Police a hard time . The animation is not state of the art , but it 's very nice otherwise ; the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of Dominion . The English dubbing is , again , lots of fun . The soundtrack of the English version is also very good . I wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that .. Anyway , Dominion Tank Police is great . It 's Japanese cyberpunk SF with lots of comedy , filled with completely over-the-top characters and situations , making sure that it never takes itself seriously . Highly recommended .  
  I 've spent years looking for a copy of this film ( 16mm , dvd , vhs ) , so I could show it to my kids . The movie is funny , and Spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business . They had to be that good to play that demented . I like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages . The movie is about a turn of the century firehouse , with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band ( when not fighting the fires ) . There 's the usual running gags , plus the mayhem of Spike Jones and his Orchestra . Also , comedy relief provided by comedian Buddy Hackett and straight-man Hugh O'Brien .  
  A lot has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true " Miike " film and I thought this sort of description might have been a cliché . But , like all clichés , it is based on the truth . All the Miike trademarks are here , the violence , the black humour , the homosexuality , the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character . Shinjuku is however , one of Miike 's most perfectly formed films . He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different , but not necessarily better . I think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film . As you might expect , the violence is utterly visceral , gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face . ( Only a Miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that . ) The film has a fantastic pace , unlike Dead or Alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle . Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues , Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here , the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past . I cannot sing Shinjuku 's praises enough . I do not want to give away too much . This is Miike before he began to use CGI to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitano 's Sonatine . The central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you 'll be popping it back on again to work it all out .  
  I 'm not entirely sure Rob Schmidt qualifies as a " Master " in the genre of horror , since he previously just directed one horror film called " Wrong Turn " and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre , but fact is that he made with " Right to Die " one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the " Masters of Horror " franchise . There was a similar underdog story in season one , when William Malone made on of the best episodes with " The Fair Haired Child " even though his other long feature films " Fear Dot Com " and " House on Haunted Hill " sucked pretty badly . The story of " Right to Die " cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia , but thankfully also features multiple old-fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance , murderous conspiracies , pitch black humor and comic book styled violence . Whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband 's continuous adultery , the Addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident . Cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife Abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially . Whilst Cliff and his sleazy attorney ( Corbin Bernsen of " The Dentist " ) want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor , Abbey 's mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on Cliff . Meanwhile Abbey 's hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in Cliff 's surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices . After a few victims , Cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well . " Right to Die " is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff I always hoped to see from a TV-series concept like " Masters of Horror " . It 's violent and gory with a sick & twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences . The euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well , yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons . The atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling . Actresses Julia Anderson and Robin Sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks , which is always a welcome plus , and Corbin Bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean-spirited and egocentric bastard . Great " MoH " episode ; definitely one of the highlights of both seasons .  
  I 'd have given this film a few stars , simply because it was a " Lifetime " presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story - here , New York City . Most on this channel , whether " set " there , in rural Iowa , Oregon , Virginia , L.A. etc . , are filmed in Vancouver , Ottawa , Toronto or some other Canadian locale . But if there ever were one deserving the top rating - 10 * on this site , it 's this movie . Certainly not for originality , for this story has been done many times , in many variations , with several very similar to this specific one . It 's also been done pretty often on the big screen , with mega-stars , past and present , from Cary Grant , James Garner , Harrison Ford , Tom Hanks , et al - and Deborah Kerr , Doris Day , Meg Ryan , and many more . I can think of at least 10-12 more , just as prominent , past to present , off the top of my head , who could be added now , and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind . Not to drone on , but my point is that , in my opinion , this is by far one of the best of this genre I 've seen . I caught it by chance on a mid-day Friday , at a time when I had the TV on only because I was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week . I 'd never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made . And , while the two leads have done enough to be known to most , they were completely unknown to me . The only two actors I knew were Phyllis Newman ( Anna 's mother ) whom I 'd seen in some things from her younger days , and Michael Rispoli ( Henry , Charlie 's best friend ) who was outstanding as " Gramma , " the menacing juice loan , tough , street guy from " Rounders . " The chance meeting and coupling between both leads ' best friends , as a sub-story romance , with the correlation of their being such to Anna and Charlie being only revealed to all later , is an oft-done plot contrivance within the genre , but makes no difference to the enjoyment here ( in fact , it enhances it ) . Checking some other comments , I agree completely with those which are the most positive . The primary word describing this film is ENGAGING , in caps . This adjective describes the performers ; the characters ; the chemistry between and among all of the characters , in whatever combination presented , and all of the supporting and even minor roles . I love films with a " harder edge : " " Rounders ; " the escapist Schwarzenegger / Stallone fare ; " Goodfellows ; " even the classics like " Casablanca , " " Gone With the Wind , " " Citizen Kane . " But for pure , uncomplicated enjoyment , this one was outstanding . With a bare fraction of their budgets , it was equal to the results achieved by " You 've Got Mail " and " Sleepless in Seattle . " And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan couldn't have done better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here ; the co-stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega-films , as well .  
  Most people who chase after movies featuring Audrey Tautou seem to not understand that Amelie was a character - it is not really Audrey Tautou 's real life personality , hence , every movie she partakes in is not going to be Amelie part 2 , part 3 , etc . Now with that said , I too picked up this movie simply because Audrey was in it . Yes , it 's true , there is a big gap after the first scene where she isn't seen at all for maybe 45 min , but I didn't even miss her because I was having so much fun with the other characters . The guy who lies about everything is too funny , the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss , actually .. getting into all the characters here could take quite a while , but this is one of the best movies I 've seen in a while . Audrey Tautou 's character Irene is not the overdone sugary girl that Amelie was . In fact , as Irene , her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first . In this film , Irene is a girl with good intentions , but over the course of a ( very awful ) day , her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic . What makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building .. very entertaining to watch , great scenery and shots , very colorful and never too slow , and all of the characters can actually act . The best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left .. this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense , and the whole butterfly effect blossoms . I swear , it was the best 20 minutes of film I 've seen in quite a while , and the ending .. It made me think " damn I really lucked out finding this movie " . The ending to this movie is top notch . Whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant , because not only are there all these other subplots going on , but to somehow make them all tie in together ( and in a sensible manner , which is the case here ) but also to make each character feel human and come alive , not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect .. very impressive . I highly suggest this movie as it 's a great film to watch anytime , in any mood , with any company or alone .  
  Wealthy psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it 's hopeless to help her patients . A young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he truly wants to help him get better . Here she gets involved with Joe Mantegna . To reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and ' House of Games ' may very well be the best con movie I 've seen . David Mamet wrote and directed this gem that 's full of snappy dialogue , great one-liners , and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end . Crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and Mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con-man . And with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie , the film is in utter control of it 's audience ; and we are loving the con . * out of *  
  The only other review of this movie as of this date really trashes the stars and the movie itself . I usually like to read the user comments to give me an idea of what to expect from a movie I don't know much about . It 's unfortunate when there aren't many comments for a certain tile , because when there is only one review and it unreasonably trashes the movie and cast , you don't get an idea of what to expect . I read the review before watching this title and I don't know where all the venom for this movie and the stars came from . Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered , even when the material was not the greatest . I found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable . It isn't one of the great all-time classics , but a pleasant and funny diversion-much more than you can hope for in most newer movies . If you are a fan of these stars , you will not be disappointed .  
  This is an extremely-powerful based on a true story film that can be infuriating to watch . I say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people , in this case an innocent Australian couple charged with killing their baby . Meryl Streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but I thought Sam Neill was just as good . Let 's just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for Streep because she had to learn an Australian accent . ( She learned it so well I had trouble understanding her in parts . ) Without giving anything away , all I can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally .  
  Although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special . If you 've never seen this film before you 'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers . I was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney 's Aladdin cribbed from the film . They loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers . I 've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten , which is where a good portion of this film dwells , because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing . Everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end . From the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting . It doesn't kill the film , but it does weaken it . Still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale , or even a great movie .  
  My first exposure to " Whale Music " was the Rheostatics album of the same name , that I bought around 1993 . I was reading the liner notes and the band said the album , which remains in a prominent place in my collection , was inspired by Canadian author Paul Quarrington 's book . I picked up the book a few months later and devoured it ! An amazing read ! I have since re-read the book numerous times , each time finding some new element to Desmond and his desire to complete the Whale Music . I found the film in 1996 , on video . I haven't had a lot of good experiences with Canadian film , but this one worked for me . The role of Claire could have been cast differently , but overall I think that Paul Quarrington 's vision was transfered nicely from the book to the screen . Maury Chaykin gives a moving performance as the isolated genius . The movie deals with family relationships , love , and finding someone who understands . I would strongly recommend " Whale Music " to not only music fans , but anyone who has ever lost something or someone , and tried to find their way back to the world .  
  " Saving Grace " is never riotously funny , but it delivers quite a few good laughs and I enjoyed it to a significant degree . Brenda Blethyn is a fine actress , and does a good job at portraying widower Grace , who resorts to growing marijuana to pay off her massive debts . The supporting cast also does a fine job . French actor Tchecky Karyo has a funny little role . The premise alone is appealing . The idea of an over-the-hill woman growing and smoking pot sounds funny enough . And the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then . Of course , there are flat moments , like one where two elderly women mistaken Grace 's marijuana leaves for tea leaves and they start pulling childish antics at the store where they work . That was a mindless gag that didn't quite take off . The film 's tone is downbeat and occasionally dull , but I got enough laughs to give this English import a recommendation . My score : 7 ( out of 10 )  
  I saw Saving Grace right after it came out on video . Since then it 's become one of my favorites ! The plot isn't particularly complex but it doesn't take away from the entertainment . It 's chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it . The characters are what makes the movie so good . They each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor , the two old ladies played by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law leaps to mind . Superb acting was done by all , particularly Brenda Blythen . She and Craig Ferguson were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments . If you 're looking for a good comedy I 'd definately recommend this movie !  
  This movie had an interesting cast , it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job . Im glad we have b grade movies like this one , the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it , you don't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot . I like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn't close down a café to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station . Arnold vosloo and Michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation . This was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future .  
  Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created . It is so addicting that you could play it for hours upon hours without stopping for a break . I 've beaten the game 4 times , but I 've never gotten all 120 stars .. ( I 've gotten 111 ) .. but I hope to achieve them eventually . Even though I didn't officially play this game until I was seven in , I loved watching my sisters play it . Now I am 13 and still play this , erasing games and starting over again . The graphics are unbelievable for an early N64 game . The gameplay is addictive . The controls are great . The levels are tough , but not impossible . The Bowser fights are challenging . I would like to tell you more , but why don't you just get it for yourself ? Put the X-BOX 360 , PS3 , and the Wii away and go find yourself a Nintendo 64 and play this amazing , wonderful game .  
  A remarkable documentary about the landmark achievements of the Women Lawyers Association ( WLA ) of Kumba , in southwest Cameroon , in legally safeguarding the rights of women and children from acts of domestic violence . In this Muslim culture , where men have always been sovereign over women , according to Sharia law , one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children . After 17 years of failed efforts , leaders of the WLA began recently to score a few wins , and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories . The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa , a state prosecutor , and Beatrice Ntuba , a senior judge ( Court President ) . Both play themselves in this film , which may contain footage shot spontaneously , though I imagine much of it , if not all , consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera . Four cases are reviewed , and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film . Two cases involve repeated wife beating , with forcible sex in one case ; another involves forced sex upon a 10 year old girl ; and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child , age 8 , by an aunt . One of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce . We follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials . The outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children . The perpetrators receive stiff prison terms and / or fines ; the divorce is granted . The aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender-neutral when it comes to enforcing the law . Also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties , including those found guilty , are treated . This is a highly important and well made film . ( Of interest is the fact that one of the directors , Ms . Longinotto , also co-directed the 1998 film , Divorce , Iranian Style , which dealt with related themes in Tehran . ) ( In broken English with English subtitles ) . My Grade : B + 8/10  
  I work at a movie store , and as such , I am always on the look-out for an excellent movie . I decided to check out Nothing as it sat in our Canadian section , and I 've been trying to support my country 's movie industry . I was in for a surprise . The film features David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a highly entertaining story that seems to delve into so much of our minds and relationships .. without working that hard . It is consistently comedic through the interaction of the two characters , as well as some funny exchanges ( " We can't be dead , we have cable ! " ) . What more can I say without noting that it is worth a shot , even if you abandon it within the first half an hour .  
  I thought this was an awesome movie . The theme song is sweet ! : ) Anyway , the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning , when everything should have been normal . It was very weird and unrealistic . The big cable company is mainly what I 'm talking about . Apart from that , the movie was very creative . I think that all the acting was well done , the actors acted out their characters ' personalities perfectly . Everything fit together well . It really is a shame that their isn't a soundtrack . That would have been great ! Because this is a Canadian film , and because it is one of my favorites , I give this movie a 10 out of 10 !  
  It 's hard to say which comes out on top , James Cagney 's charm and energy or the mouth - opening excesses of Busby Berkeley 's three grand showstoppers at the close . I give it a tie , with Footlight Parade one of the funniest and quickest of the early Thirties musicals . Although the movie clearly belongs to Cagney , Joan Blondell adds immeasurably to the good-natured story line . And what 's the story line ? It 's about Chester Kent ( Cagney ) who produces musicals , and who now is just about out of business as the talkies take over . He starts doing Prologues , live musical entertainment offered on stage before a movie starts . He gets the idea to do bigger ones and more of them , moving them around the country . He 's a ball of fire and ideas , and he needs all the ideas he can get to keep relentlessly producing these things . But a rival is spying on him and stealing his ideas ; Nan Prescott ( Blondell ) , his wise-cracking secretary , loves him but he 's too busy too notice ; an office girl in black-rimmed , round glasses ( Ruby Keeler ) wants a chance to dance ; his wife turns up saying she didn't divorce him after all ; a blonde gold-digger is setting her hooks in him ; his partners are cheating him .. my gosh , what 's next ? This may all sound like a lot to digest , but everything happens fast , with Cagney bouncing , strutting , striding , finger-snapping , barking orders and occasionally - until the big last number when he goes all out singing and dancing - doing a step or two just to show how it 's done . Instead of " Let 's put on a show , gang " we have " We need to build three shows in three days , so lock the doors and let 's start rehearsing . " These three super Prologues are going to feature 40 chorines , spectacular effects and will mean a rich contract , with forty Kent units in deluxe movie houses .. the whole Apollo movie house circuit ! Exhaustion threatens , feet ache , but all those unbilled chorines in skimpy costumes ( which include Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour ; you can quickly spot Sothern but Lamour is more generic ) stay the course , dancing their hearts out , giggling and chattering and looking remarkably unsweaty . And then the curtains go up as each Prologue is presented in separate movie houses , one after the other on the same night , with the owner of the Apollo circuit going to determine that night whether he 'll save Chester 's skin or not . First up is " Honeymoon Hotel " with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler in a 9 minute production number that features a lot of wholesome lasciviousness , with brides and grooms ( some might even be married ) , bedrooms and beds , and doors with " Do not disturb " signs . Then on to the next theater and 11 minutes of " By a Waterfall " that probably had the Warner Brothers accountants worrying about bankruptcy . This number is so excessive - dozens of swimming girls , trees , fountains , a huge grotto with waterslides , a giant pool - you 'd never think there was a Depression on . Berkeley pulls out all his tricks - synchronization , human patterns , legs and arms doing all sorts of precision things - and he does it in the water , with a lot of underwater photography looking up . The girls are sure game . They come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks . The whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting . Ruby Keeler , who has a couple of quick shots in the water , is the only one who looks a bit cautious . And finally , the smash finale .. 11 minutes of Cagney dancing and singing with Keeler to " Shanghai Lil , " with all sorts of bar girls and their customers , unusual in that the races are mixed up . There 's Cagney and Keeler dancing on the bar , dancing on a table , Cagney fighting . There are what looks like fifty or sixty marching marines , hupping back and forth , rifles tossed and caught . Then .. this is true .. a human picture forms of Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA eagle . This may be the only Hollywood musical production that has ever featured Roosevelt , a big federal agency and a bevy of sexy Chinese prostitutes . That 's entertainment , folks . It 's great ! Of course , Chester 's Prologues get the big contract and Nan gets Chester . The movie is full of juicy clichés that make us smile . Ruby Keeler is so endearing as she earnestly stomps out her taps with her arms flying that you want to help her along . Joan Blondell makes us forget about a lot of Hollywood females who might have been more beautiful but who had a lot less wit and personality . The movie , however , belongs to Cagney , who grabs and shakes it , and to Berkeley , a man for whom too much was never too much .  
  " Footlight Parade " is just one of several wonderfully jaunty musicals that Warner Bros . produced in the early 1930 's to ward off the Depression . " 42nd Street " and the Golddiggers series were also produced during this era , and they made literally , millions of Americans forget their troubles for a little while , and enjoy themselves . While most of the films produced had the great talents of Joan Blondell , Ruby Keeler , and Dick Powell , only Foolight Parade had the incomparable James Cagney . Almost ten years prior to his most well-known musical , " Yankee Doodle Dandy " . Here he dances in that most original of dance styles , with his arms usually lowered at his side , and his legs doing all types of undulations and kicks . It 's easy to see that he is enjoying himself , and that makes us enjoy him all the more . While almost all of the musical sequences appear at the end of the film , they are well worth the wait . I believe that this film was made just prior to the installation of the production code , so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit risqué . But it 's all in fun . It doesn't matter what the plot of the film is , just know that there are plenty of laughs and a superlative cast . Besides those already mentioned , Guy Kibbee is at his flustered best here . 7 out of 10  
  Pleasant story of the community of Pimlico in London who , after an unexploded WW2 bomb explodes , find a Royal Charter stating that the area they live in forms part of Burgundy . This movie works because it appeals to the fantasy a lot of us have about making up our own rules and not having to listen to THEM . A solid cast of British stalwarts , especially Stanley Holloway , makes this more believable . There are some very nice moments in the film , such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other Londoners on the other side of the barricade start throwing food and other things over to them . Even though you always knew Pimlico would become part of the UK again , the people of PImlico and as a consequence the viewer doesn't mind when this happens , leaving a nice happy feeling . It 's amazing to think that these low budget movies from a small studio in London still remain so popular over fifty years later . The producers must have got something right .  
  What can I say that hasn't been said about " The Haunting " ? It has everything that would make a great picture . Wonderful sets , moody music , and sound design to die for were all in place . The screenplay , though , sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird , surrealistic way . The entire team must have forgotten to read it through , maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was . Each member of the cast gives a worthy performance , although with little conviction to the material at hand . Lili Taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her . But that 's about it . All I can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours , but you will definitely want more . A lot more .  
  Excellent show . Instead of watching the same old sitcom type shows where it 's the same old thing , just different " stars " , this refreshing show provided an incredibly entertaining view of office situations . We have been away from watching any television for 2 years and after coming back , of all the shows available we look forward to watching this show on W . Shame on Global for pulling the plug on this one . I thought this one would be a winner . Let 's be realistic about things , FEW Canadian SHOWS make it . Everyone I talk to enjoys this show and I believe it was foolish of Global to walk away . I guess they want to stick it out with the typical mind numbing shows from the States instead of pulling behind a Canadian made show that had a lot of promise . Don't get me wrong , I enjoy a lot of shows on TV , but , come on people , let 's keep the variety . This unique show provided a very comedic view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships , with unique characters that you don't see on any sitcoms today or in the past . Too bad that global had to say no to this one , foolish mistake .  
  I could see this film is super He didn't surprise to oneself when so that it was taking place for the truth , this way by itself how swigged flight to the which didn't have the place but it is only such an conspiratorial theory , Right ? Very I liked watching this film when I was the child . I am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really , certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense . Who at healthy senses , sent to kids with space shuttle into the orbit . I very like reading for the subject , American and Soviet space programs . I know a few missions of space shuttles remained provided by CIA with the clause TOP SECRET certainly these are only such my divagations but who knows ?  
  I saw this ages ago when I was younger and could never remember the title , until one day I was scrolling through John Candy 's film credits on IMDb and noticed an entry named " Once Upon a Crime .. " . Something rang a bell and I clicked on it , and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memories . I 've found it has aged pretty well despite the fact that it is not by any means a " great " comedy . It is , however , rather enjoyable and is a good riff on a Hitchcock formula of mistaken identity and worldwide thrills . The movie has a large cast of characters , amongst them an American couple who find a woman 's dog while vacationing in Europe and decide to return it to her for a reward - only to find her dead body upon arrival . From there the plot gets crazier and sillier and they go on the run after the police think they are the killers . Kind of a mix between " It 's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World " and a lighter Hitchcock feature , this was directed by Eugene Levy and he managed to get some of his good friends - such as John Candy - to star in it . The movie is mostly engaging due to its cast , and the ending has a funny little twist that isn't totally unpredictable but also is kind of unexpected .  
  I love Monte Carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie . I thought everyone was very good . I was not familiar with Richard Lewis , I thought he made his character ( Julian Peters ) very personable , funny and attractive . Sean Young was very good as the befuddled rejected girl with a heart of gold . George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo . John Candy has a field day as the bon vivant . James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk . Cybill Shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife . Delightful ensemble cast . Lots of talent , clever script , lots going on and beautiful locations . Just a nice pick me up for a dreary day . Especially in the winter when a trip to Europe is not anywhere on your horizon .  
  .. about the importance of being young , having friends , and most of all enjoying life . Through the experience of four friends , Ligabue shows to the audience how life was back in the 70 's in a small italian village . the four carachters represent the four different aspects of human behavior ; also the drug experience is well represented .  
  I thought this movie was fantastic . It was hilarious . Kinda reminded me of Spinal Tap . This is a must see for any fan of 70 's rock . ( I hope me and my friends aren't like that in twenty years ! ) Bill Nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit , Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together , but not succeeding well . If you love music , and were ever in a band , this movie is definitely for you . You won't regret seeing this movie . I know I don't . Even my family found it funny , and that 's saying something .  
  > Contrary to most reviews I 've read , I didn't feel this followed any of the other rock movies ( " Spinal Tap " , etc . ) The story was more unique , although I feel most people wanted to see the " sex , drugs & rock and roll " vices that the band kept alluding to . > As an American , I knew a few of the actors - Spall , Connelly & Rea . Surprised to find out " Brian " / Bruce Robinson was in Zifferedi 's ( < sp ? ) classic " Romeo & Juliet " . Guess I 'll have to rent that next . > " THE FLAME STILL BURNS " - My wife , who hails from Mexico , didn't follow the English / British language too well , missed some of the jokes ( which I dutifully explained ) but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene . She loves the song so much now . > Funny that Amazon . com has the soundtrack for $ 30 + usd when I bought the DVD in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart for $ 5.50usd . Price non-withstanding , I first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since .  
  This movie is tremendous for uplifting the Spirits . Every time I watch it , I see & hear funny little things that I missed before . The soundtrack is unbelievable . Mick Jones ( Foreigner ) and Chris Difford ( Squeeze ) penned the songs , making Strange Fruit the best thing that ever hit today 's music scene . Unfortunately , Strange Fruit are a strictly fictitional washed up ' 60 's to 70 's band that were never good to begin with , due to drug use and inner fighting . One wonders what might have been , while listening to their fanatstic soundtrack . The Fruit draw inspiration from The Rolling Stones , Deep Purple , David Bowie , and The Who . Each member of Fruit are quite memorable . Stephen Rea stars as down and dead broke Tony Costello , who is asked by a festival promoter to reunite his band for a reunion tour , with hopes of reaping monetary benefits . Costello haply approaches ex-roadie Karen Knowles , played by Juliet Aubrey , to help him rekindle the flame of a dream long past . Juliet gathers up the bitter Jimmy Nail ( Les Wickes ) , blundering Timothy Spall ( David ' Beano ' Baggot ) , and extravagantly glamouresque Ray Simms ( Bill Nighy ) . Tumbling in is another ex-roadie , the hippy-toker-jokester Hughie ( Billy Connolly ) , who never let the flame burn out . As Juliet searches for the last member of their motley band , the elusive guitarist-songwriter Brian Lovell ( played by the brooding Bruce Robinson ) , the reunited members squabble , just like old times , fighting over each others ' rusty talent . The band is then given the chance to do a small Dutch tour , to prepare for the festival . With young Hendrix-like Luke Shand ( Hans Matheson ) taking the place of Lovell , the crew hits the road . The sparks fly as their memories flame forward , threatening to burn their unfinished goals .. Be prepared to laugh , sing , cheer , and cry , as these memorable characters etch themselves back into your hearts ..  
  This movie is a little unusual in that it 's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace . While this makes it pretty different from the average Grant film , it is still highly watchable and entertaining . It 's sort of like someone said " let 's just follow Cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed " . Considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas , the film works very well . While the film has pretty modest pretensions , it makes the most of the material . It 's a great film for Cary Grant fans or for the whole family .  
  Personally , I find the movie to be quite a good watch . It outlines the actual situation of triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized . Not only that , it also shows the viewer how the Hong Kong police control the triad situation and why the police don't just go all out and wipe out triads . Overall , the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings & torture . Nevertheless , the movie stays true to the real world , thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens . I 'd recommend this movie to any Triad / Mafia movie fan . Another good watch would be Dragon Squad . That movie has more guns than this , as in this movie there 's more knives than guns ( in fact I don't remember seeing a single gun ) .  
  This movie was made in 1948 , but it still rings true today . Very , very funny . It begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it " builds " from there . Anyone who has ever built a house , will find this movie very endearing . Great cast . Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this film . This is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40 's .. clothing , architecture and family life . Many references are made to the cost of things , and those comparisons to today 's costs are pretty amazing . I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely . I am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it . A true classic .  
  As with all of Angelopoulos ' films , " The Suspended Step of the Stork " implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer , a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work . Dialogues are sparing , with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters ' inner conflicts , doubts , or feelings . The filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses , and instead forces them to explore and study the characters ' identities for themselves . As a result , the acting is understated and implicit , as opposed to overt and explicit . The action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation , where the viewer is asked to become a participant , to participate as an actor , by probing his or her own psyche . As in a novel , where the drama rests entirely on the author 's writing to provide a template where the reader 's imagination and / or past experience flourish , Angelopoulos ' drama rests within his images : his uses of the long shots , the long takes , the leisurely pacing , the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark , inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective . Angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity , reverting to the non-verbal language of gestures , gazes , sounds , and music , when he believes that words can only take us so far . The music , by Angelopoulos ' long time collaborator , Eleni Karaindrou , provides more than just a discreet background , but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story . A large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle , subdued colors , recorded in a drab winter light . Angelopoulos presents us with an " other Greece , " one far different from the Greece of the tourist brochures , with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas , drowned in an eternal sunshine . Here , the skies are covered and gray , the air is cold and misty , and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled , dirty snow of the village streets . Angelopoulos ' genius through Arvanitis ' camera is on display throughout the film . " The Suspended Step of the Stork " is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio-political situation in the Balkans at the end of the twentieth century . It is deeply concerned with the meaning of " borders , " and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations . In the " waiting room " facing the Albanian border , the refugees , political or other , outcast by the rest of humanity , wait . They may be stuck against a political border , but unfortunately they still carry with them , and hang on , deeper ancestral borders : those of the languages , of the customs , and of the races . Although Angelopoulos ' political views are well known , the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees ' plights . In the process , Angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical , cultural , political , and personal " borders . " Angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century Greece , and he likes to bring lessons from the Hellenic myths into his discussions . In this film , he does some border crossing himself between the Greek and Italian cultures , drawing from a combined Homeric and Dantesque tradition of Odysseus ' travel . Alexander is a Telemachus , in search of a story about an aging Greek politician / Odysseus who disappeared , never to be heard of again . This political man , a brilliant orator , unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence , his wife , and his brilliant career , to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low . He became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world . Of course , the " politician " is not Alexander 's father , but the " politician " stands before Alexander like a father figure / Odysseus . As with Homer 's Telemachus , Alexander grows as a person during his odyssey . Of course , it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of Homer 's Odyssey in a contemporary context . Angelopoulos draws on Odysseus 's travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film . In Angelopoulos ' ending , " Odysseus " is more like the Dante 's Odysseus : he does not leave for Ithaca but goes on , " carrying a suitcase . " And Alexander / Telemachus is " suspended " between returning to his home and his career , or embarking on a voyage to " somewhere else . " He states as much , in a voice-over at the beginning of the film , paraphrasing few lines from Dante 's " Inferno " : " And don't forget that the time for a voyage has come again . The wind blows your eyes far away . " Finally , although Angelopoulos is not a religious person , there is a Greek Orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellow-suited linesmen , who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications , and also the Christ-like figure of the " politician . " In the final scene , these men in yellow demonstrate once more the Byzantine iconography 's influence in Angelopoulos ' work . They appear like " stylites , " religious figures found in the Orthodox tradition , solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars , in a form of asceticism . The film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by Mastroianni . Angelopoulos does not give us any clues , and the wife 's statement , " It 's not him , " is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough . The important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician , but that he could be the politician . But the film still ends on an optimistic note . Whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river , and thus communications across the border are still not possible , and it remains impenetrable , we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river : the camera has crossed the border , and the reverse tracking shot is inviting Alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary . On this account , Angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow , some of the borders will eventually crumble .  
  A most recommendable masterpiece , not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of Angelopoulos , not to mention the acting of giants , Mastroianni and Moreau , and the remarkable character play by Ilias Logothethis . Gregory Karr 's performance may seem overshadowed by his " tough " partners ' at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character , which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl ( Khrysikou ) and the man ( Mastroianni ) , albeit hinted beforehand . ( Hence the spoiler . ) Get your expectations straight ! It 's an " art movie " in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention . Not for spending free time , but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert . Due to the overall photographic style , large screen viewing is recommended . Dialogues are used sparingly . But the film includes - in addition to the standard Greek and English speaking - fragments spoken in Albanian , Kurdish and Turkish , which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages .  
  Don't listen to the prissy critics who are probably bitter gamers still sore from the roasting Silverman infamously gave them at Spike TV Video Game Awards a couple of months ago , " The Sarah Silverman " is wonderfully bizarre , surreal , immature , ridiculous and would fit rather nicely in a Adult Swim line-up . If Silverman tones down the juvenile " doody " jokes and emphasizes the darker , meaner undercurrent the show is so far just hinting at , we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled " Strangers With Candy " . But just from watching the pilot , its just solid , not outstanding , offbeat dark comedy / musical but with huge potential . Silverman has created a hilarious child-woman of a character - a prettier , younger , Jewish American Princess version of the late great Jerri Blank and the show features one of the most unconventional , non-stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple I have ever seen on television . Early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so I can't wait to see how this show unfolds .  
  All I can say is , if you don't fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie , then you 're not human ! Even after watching it for the first time , I was hooked . It is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe , as I 'm sure other fans will attest to . After watching it , you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us . At least we have Grey Gardens to remember them ! I think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with . Although I have always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy , she does not stay in your heart the way Big and Little Edie do . What a rare treat to have know such people ; I only wish I had !  
  Grey Gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldn't really look away . It was so strange , and funny and sad and sick and  .. really no words can describe . The move Grey Gardens is beyond bizarre . I found out about this film reading my Uncle John 's Great Big Bathroom Reader , by the Bathroom Reader 's Institute and it was well worth the rental and bump to the top of my movie watching queue . This movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed . One should watch it for their favorite Edie outfits , which I am sure include curtains . When I get old I almost wish to be just like Big Edie , thumbing my nose at normalcy and society .  
  ' Grey Gardens ' ( 1975 ) is the Maysles ' brothers bizarre documentary of Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis'eccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down 28 room mansion on East Hampton , Long Island . ' Big Edie ' Bouvier Beale , 78 , witty and dry and her daughter , ' Little Edie ' Beale , 56 , ( emotionally about 13 ) a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future , live in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in the attic . They amuse themselves by bickering all day , listening to the radio or singing to each other ( They dont even own a television ) Their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special , although obviously , dysfunctional people . One of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today .  
  There was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director Vincenzo Natali with interesting camera angles and effective close-ups . It was also refreshing to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers . This film also included one of the most imaginative " escape " scenes in recent years . The efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller . Although the plotting of the film was convoluted , the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealed . In 1949 , George Orwell suggested in his famous novel " 1984 " that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian State , which would control minds and diminish human liberty . It was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film , it was not the State , but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker .  
  When The Matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity , it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration . That didn't really happen , surprisingly , and it took till 2002 for a movie of similar theme to appear . But to say Cypher is a clone would be to its discredit . The story is of a Morgan Sullivan , who applies for a job with a high-flying techno-company called Digicorp . His job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company , while under an assumed and false identity . His home-life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he 's actually doing . However , things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows what 's going on , he starts to question who he actually is . This is not helped by a strange woman who turns up .. Twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated , and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable . It 's an enthralling journey through a not-too-distant future , and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat . Highly recommended .  
  I wasn't sure at first if I was watching a documentary , propaganda film or dramatic presentation . I guess given the time of production it was a mix of all three . Admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable . But you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on . We were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipment . Where this movie came together for me was closer to the end . The scenes had a realism ( at least as I perceived it ) that I haven't encountered often before . You could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants . This was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable Japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real Japanese actors would be somewhat scarce . The movie is excellent as a source of the state of the American mindset in 1943 as the war waged with Japan . Also of interest was a dig at the Japanese with respect to the help the USA gave Japan in past years .  
  Cliffhanger is what appears to be Slyvester Stallone 's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor . It 's about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over 100 million dollars . It has great action sequence 's , edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies .  
  I can't add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here - great acting , balanced writing , multi-faceted characters , a great anti-hero in Tony , great commentary on millennial American life . The integral use of psychiatry coupled with Tony 's mother issues are especially fresh and humorous . Several other characters add a lot of depth - Hesh 's interesting history as an outsider muscling in , Ralphie 's total irredeemable viciousness , Chris ' dual desires in life , and so on . I have to dig into some of the criticisms however , especially the ' it glorifies violence / belittles Italian-Americans ' one . Most of the writers and actors are Italian-American , would they attack themselves ? There are several positive Italian-American characters - Artie Bucco the chef , Dr . Melfi and her family and the Cusamanos next door to the Sopranos . Indeed , Dr Melfi 's ex-husband notes in season 1 that only a tiny minority of Italian-Americans have ever had Mob connections ( certainly smaller than the proportion of African-Americans involved in crime , dare I say it . In both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes ) . Most of the characters don't really choose the life they have ; family background or circumstances largely corner them into it . Outsiders ( even of Italian stock ) who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends - Matthew and his friend in season 2 , for example . If you criticise this show , I assume Frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist , or Will & Grace made you want to go homosexual ? Presumably you won't listen to rap music that discusses gangs , or r'n'b which discusses promiscuity , or rock music which discusses drugs ( or any other combination ) ? People aren't as stupid as some of you make out .. Not everything is perfect however . A lot of characters have only appeared once , when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes - Tracee the dancer , Meadow 's friend Ally , Uncle Junior 's ladyfriend ( supposedly for 20 years until they split in season 1 ) .  
  John Schlesinger 's ' Midnight Cowboy ' is perhaps most notable for being the only X-rated film in Academy history to receive the Oscar for Best Picture . This was certainly how I first came to hear of it , and , to be completely honest , I didn't really expect much of the film . This is not to say that I thought it would be horrible , but somehow I didn't consider it the sort of movie that I would enjoy watching . This is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners  a remarkable combination of stellar acting , ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack ( " Everybody 's talking ' at me , I don't hear a word they 're sayin ' " ) make this film one of the finest explorations of life , naivety and friendship ever released . Young Joe Buck ( then-newcomer Jon Voight ) , dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy , travels from Texas to New York to seek a new life as a hustler , a male prostitute . Women , however , do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services , and Joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up . During these exploits , Joe comes to meet Enrico " Ratso " Rizzo ( Dustin Hoffman ) , a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con Joe out of all his money . When they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament , Ratso offers Joe a place to stay , and , working together , they attempt to make ( largely dishonest ) lives for themselves in the cold , gritty metropolis of New York . Joe had convinced himself that New York women would be more than willing to pay for sex ; however , his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman ( Sylvia Miles ) twenty dollars . Though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent , Ratso is just as naïve as Joe . Ratso , with his painful limp and hacking cough , is always assuring himself that , if only he could travel to the warmth of Miami , somehow everything would be all right . This misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of Lennie and George of John Steinbeck 's classic novel , ' Of Mice and Men . ' Shot largely on the streets of New York , ' Midnight Cowboy ' is a grittily-realistic look at life in the slums . Watching the film , we can almost feel ourselves inside Ratso 's squalid , unheated residence , our joints stiff from the aching winter cold . The acting certainly contributes to this ultra-realism , with both Voight and Hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society . Hoffman , in particular , is exceptional in his role ( I 'm walkin ' here ! I 'm walkin ' here ! " ) , managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much-lauded debut in 1967 's ' The Graduate . ' Both stars were later nominated for Best Actor Oscars ( also nominated for acting  bafflingly  was Sylvia Miles , for an appearance that can't have been for more than five minutes ) , though both ultimately lost out to John Wayne in ' True Grit . ' ' Midnight Cowboy ' eventually went on to win three Oscars from seven nominations , including Best Picture , Best Director for Schlesinger and Best Writing for Waldo Salt . ' Midnight Cowboy ' is told mainly in a linear fashion , though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at Joe 's past . Rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about , the audience is invited to think about it for themselves , and how these circumstances could have led Joe onto the path he is now pursuing . The achingly-beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope , but a large amount of uncertainty . Gritty , thought-provoking and intensely fascinating , ' Midnight Cowboy ' is one for the ages .  
  Ok , first I have to point the fact that when I first saw this flick I was 9 years old . If I had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time , I´d probably have noted that this is just another cheaply made cable TV horror film with some well-made scenes . But when you´re nine you just don´t care about those facts . This scared the hell out of me back then , especially those aforementioned Zelda - scenes ( and they still do ) . Nowadays I´m kind of hooked to this film . I have to see this maybe once in a month , and on every new year´s eve I watch this with a 12-pack of beer & bunch of friends . It´s like an appetizer for a good party ! I kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense . Midkiff and Crosby do look like I wanted Louis and Rachel look like , but one can´t see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two . Hughes and Gwynne pretty much save the scenes which " the Creeds " underact . What I actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to Pet Sematary , and I don´t mean the zombie stuff here . THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS CERTAINLY A NOVELTY AND ONE OF A KIND . Honestly , how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable-TV one , but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror-chillers out there ? Alright I busted some of the cast´s balls a minute ago , but I have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection . But hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to Pet Sematary ! I really would love to know .. And I don´t mean night of the living dead here .. this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff .  
  I have screened this movie several times here at college , and every time I show it , the number of people watching with me grows exponentially .. in addition to the virgins , anyone I 've already shown it to NEEDS to see it again ! It takes a little while to get into it , but by the end the whole room is screaming , shouting , yelling , rewinding scenes repeatedly , repeating dialogue , and just totally and completely engrossed in the moviegoing experience that is Pia Zadora in " The Lonely Lady " ! Scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed , poorly written , horribly acted TRASH is thrown at you in an all-out assault that ranks as the campiest thing I own ( no small statement , friends ) . For me nothing compares 2 U , Pia .. and I don't suppose I 'm the only one who 's ever felt this way !  
  Another silent love triangle film from Hitchcock , not a mystery , but very English , very well-paced and photographed . Smooth boxer Bob Corby ( Ian Hunter ) recruits circus boxer " One Round " Jack Sander ( Carl Brisson ) to be his sparring partner , partly to keep the pretty but fickle Mabel ( Lilian Hall-Davis ) nearby . There are lots of character actors and grotesquesat Jack and Mabel 's wedding the verger , standing in the aisle of the church , registers shock at the sight of the very tall and the very short men , the fat lady , the conjoined twins who , of course , argue about which side of the aisle to sit , and the wedding feast is amusing . The rest of the movie has Jack losing Mabel and boxing his way back to her heart , or something like that . It was another era altogether , with the audience in evening dress , and the boxers dressing up , too , when out of the ring . The camera angles , the pace , the use of symbols , the cuttingall very stylish and masterful . The camera-work and editing of the last boxing match is very gripping . Brisson 's good looks are well-used in this one ; his smiling is not so oblivious of what 's going on around him as he is in Hitchcock 's The Manxman , and so is not annoying . But can boxers have such dimples ?  
  Surprisingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock . One of the only original screenplays written by Hitchcock himself , this film shows remarkable story structure . It kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champ " One Round " Jack loses to a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter . The movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack , his girl and the professional boxer . The rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the rematch between the two men , this time for the heavyweight crown . Even in this early film , Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement . An armband bought for the girl by the boxer continues to pop up throughout the movie as a symbol of her unfaithfulness . The only big detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927 . The final match , as a result , ends up being somewhat anticlimactic . The story , though , is what carries this film through .  
  Considering the big name cast and lavish production I expected a lot more of this film . The acting for the most part is great , although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best . However the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent .  
  With the amount of actors they have working on the project they have a wide variety of cast . Nice starship CGI in places BUT their green screen needs some work . Anyone heard of Adobe After Effects 7 , they should buy it get their keying better . Stories are well thought out , plenty of trek elements in this to keep it in the right context . BUT BUT the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode . Im not homophobic but i cant help that i don't find men kissing entertaining ( dont mind women ) . Anyway .. For a fan series this is good stuff . With minor improvement in their green screen , brush up acting and some guidance ratings this series is stunning . Anyway i recommend this series to who ever enjoyed TNG and DS9 .  
  Star Trek : Hidden Frontier is a long-running internet only fan film , done completely for the love of the series , and a must watch for fans of Trek . The production quality is extremely high for a fan film , although sometimes you can tell that they 're green-screenin ' it . This doesn't take away from the overall experience however . The CGI ships are fantastic , as well as the space battle scenes .. On the negative side , I could tell in the earlier episodes ( and even occasionally in the newer ones ) that some of the actors / actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles , but once again , this doesn't take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of Star Trek . The cast and crew have truly come up with something special here , and , as a whole , I would highly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9 .  
  Anyone interested in pop music , and not familiar with British music trends of the late-seventies , should be sure to watch Breaking Glass at least once . The movie , about a young woman 's quest to make her mark in the music world , captures the times perfectly , from the overt sexism , rough economic times , social upheaval , to the shift in pop culture from rough-and-tumble punk to terribly fey and pretentious Futurism / New Romanticism . The music and fashion styles created daily in Britain in the late-seventies are still being rediscovered and recycled ( there really has been nothing new since 1980 ) . This was a dazzling time , and Breaking Glass both tells a very personal story and surveys the cultural landscape , and does both extremely well .  
  It 's been a long time since I saw this mini-series and I am happy to say its remembered merits have withstood the test of time . Most of the components of ' A Perfect Spy ' , the adaptation of LeCarré 's finest novel , in my opinion , are top-drawer . Outstanding aspects of it are the musical score and the masterful screenplay , the latter written by Arthur Hopcraft who was also , I believe , the screenwriter for ' Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy ' with Alec Guinness a few years before . The actors are mostly very good , some superb , like Alan Howard 's Jack Brotherhood and Ray McAnally 's Ricky Pym . Peter Egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle . The passage of time and the effects upon the physical appearances of the characters is very believably done . So much so that I wondered exactly how old Peter Egan was at the time of filming . The only jolt comes after the character of Magnus Pym is transferred from the very able hands of a young actor named Benedict Taylor to those of a noticeably too-old Peter Egan , just fresh out of Oxford . But this is a minor and unimportant seam in the whole . Egan has trouble being convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and he needs to be " upset " emotionally , ie cry . None of the actors have a very easy time with these moments , aside from the wonderful Frances Tomelty who plays Peggy Wentworth for all she 's worth and steals the episode with ease . Jane Booker is annoying as Mary Pym . She has part of the character under her skin but often displays an amateurish petulance that diminishes her as a tough cookie diplomatic housewife , which Mary Pym is . Rüdiger Weigang is splendid as Axel , amusing , ironic and brilliant . I also enjoyed Sarah Badel 's camp turn as the Baroness . The British view of Americans is vividly rendered in some dryly hilarious scenes . When the Yanks have come abroad to confab with Bo Brammell ( head of MI6 ) the American contingent are portrayed as empty-headed buffoons who appear to have memorized a lot of long words out of the Dictionary and spiced them liberally with American jargon and psycho babble , much to the bemused scorn of the English . The humor and sadness are subtly blended . LeCarré has a knack for mixing disparate elements in his stories and Hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholy , yet wistful , atmosphere of the original . Not a perfect production ( what is ? ) and yet the best of the LeCarré adaptations to reach film or television to date . Highly recommended to all spy-thriller lovers and especially LeCarré fans . DVD available from Acorn .  
  THE DEVIL 'S PLAYTHING is my second attempt at a Joseph Sarno production - and although I will say it is far more enjoyable than the painfully dull and unerotic Swedish WILDCATS , it is still a little slow and un-explicit for my taste . This one centers around a group of vampire girls who live in a castle , that want to resurrect their previously murdered " leader " . In order to do so , the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and chant weird stuff - and of course drink some blood , too . When a doctor and her brother 's car breaks down and they have to stop at the castle for lodging - they provide the ideal bloodbank for the horny vampires .. but they may not be as helpless as they seem .. THE DEVIL 'S PLAYTHING is a pretty good example of early 70 's exploit sleaze . Lots of nudity - including some full-frontal , some sleazy undertones - including incest and of course , lesbo-bloodsucking .. but these scenes are still pretty tame by today 's standards . Some pretty hot women in this one , would have benefited from some more explicit sex , but I guess ya can't have it all . Also would have benefited from some heavier violence / gore , being that it IS a vampire film , but I think the purpose of THE DEVIL 'S PLAYTHING was more to showcase skin , not blood . Still a little slow - and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden - but that 's to be expected from something from this era and of this budget . Worth a look to exploit fans - others may find it a little too dull for their liking . 7/10  
  This movie is a ripoff of James Cain 's novel , THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE . Apparently , the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story-perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the Italians in WWII might account for their forgetting to consider royalties ! Despite this , the movie isn't really just an Italian version of the Hollywood movie . In some ways it 's a lot better and in other ways , it is definitely not . The three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people . In fact , the male and female lovers are a bit icky-looking . The male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair ( particularly on the back and shoulders ) and his lady love is , to put it frankly , unattractive . They are a very , very far cry from Lana Turner and John Garfield in the Hollywood version . And the ill-fated husband is really , really obese and loves to walk around shirtless-and his counterpart in the American film , Cecil Kellaway is definitely better looking ( and probably better looking than the other two Italian leads , actually ) . And this unattractiveness is generally a reason I actually preferred the Italian film-since I just could NOT imagine a finely coiffed " dish " like Lana Turner in the middle of nowhere married to Kellaway-I am 100 % sure she would have had dozens of better offers ! Whereas , the Italian wife frankly might NOT have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable . Part of the Italian film 's believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex . The sanitized American film tries to make you believe that although Turner and Garfield kill Kellaway , they never actually get around to sex ! This is pretty silly and totally unrealistic . In addition to the casual sexuality of the film , it 's also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life-with lots of sweaty people , a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath . The movie is also pretty fast-paced compared to the over-long American film . And what you get due to brevity isn't all good . The film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the American film-with grainier footage , relatively poor orchestration and sets . It sure ain't a pretty film , but the Neo-Realistic-like style makes the film seem more realistic . But it cannot make up for the short-cuts in the plot . Many of the plot elements in the later American version are either missing entirely or glossed over . And the ending seems a lot less interesting than the American film-and misses the entire human nature dilemma when Turner and Garfield turn on each other like rats ( the best part of the American film ) . So which is the better film ? Well , a lot of this probably depends on you . As for me , the Warner Brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic ( though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles ) - but it packed a great ending . And the Italian film was much , much more realistic-until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed . So neither film is exactly great , but I 'd give my nod to the Italian one being a bit better . It 's too bad they couldn't have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film .  
  This film may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for TV , but it is one of the best movies I 've seen . The film and its actors won several awards . It is gripping , fascinating , and it will absorb you completely . The story of a chase for a killer in iron-curtain Russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction - but it 's ostensibly a true story . I highly recommend it .  
  Though I saw this movie years ago , its impact has never left me . Stephen Rea 's depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving . His anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable . Everyone in the cast is amazing from Sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts , to the troubled citizen x . Each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers , I think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers .  
  .. Oxford , Mississippi , at least . Okay , the Paris we get is Paris , Culver City apart from the Establishing library footage of the real McCoy but it IS Paris in spirit than which nothing , nowhere , is better . Okay , Kelly is no Astaire but then who is and Caron is no Hepburn , ditto but Alan Lerner is light years ahead of the vastly overrated Comden and Green who scripted Kelly 's other ' big ' 50s musical Singin ' In The Rain ( a curious replication of lyricists writing screenplays featuring songs by OTHER lyricists and just to balance things the Gershwin numbers are far superior to the Arthur Freed / Nacio Herb Brown numbers so Alan Lerner didn't have to feel too outclassed ) . The story needn't detain us any more than the anomalies - Kelly hasn't got change of a match and is a painter , i . e . bohemian , yet he is able to scare up a perfectly good suit at a few hours notice when Foch invites him to dinner at her hotel ; in the well-documented Love Is Here To Stay sequence the lovers are strangely unmolested by passers-by , other lovers and the bridge in the background is totally free of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic - this is , after all , a feelgood musical so it stands or falls by the score and in this case it stands four square . As feel good musicals go it 's definitely in the top 10 .  
  Released two years before I was born , this Oscar-winning movie has it all - lavish Technicolor sets and costumes , breathtaking cinematography , superb wall-to-wall Gershwin music , superior choreography , a lighter-than-air screenplay , and great performances by Kelly , Levant , Foch , Guetary , and Caron . Hollywood doesn't make ' em like this anymore . Definitely , this is my favorite movie of all time , a standard by which I judge all other films . ENJOY , ENJOY , ENJOY !  
  I haven't seen this movie in about 5 years , but it still haunts me . When asked about my favorite films , this is the one that I seem to always mention first . There are certain films ( works of art like this film , " Dark City " , and " Breaking the Waves " ) that seem to touch a place within you , a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive , that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer , not unlike a life-changing event , such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend .. This film " shook " me when I first saw it . It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days .  
  This movie shows life in northern Cameroon from the perspective of a young French girl , France Dalens , whose father is an official for the colonial ( French ) government , and whose family is one of the few white families around . It gives a sense of what life was like both for the colonists and for the natives with whom they associated . It 's a sense consistent with another movie I 've seen about Africa in a similar time period ( Nirgendwo in Afrika ( 2001 ) ) , but I have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is . It 's not just an impression - things do happen in the movie - but the plot is understated . The viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than having the filmmakers ' forced upon him , although the framing of the story as a flashback from the woman 's visit to south-western Cameroon as an adult provides some perspective .  
  Go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of Andy Goldsworthy 's sculptures , and treat yourself to a thoroughly eye-opening and relaxing experience . The music perfectly complements the footage , but never draws attention towards itself . Some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot , but consider this : why would you expand on this in a movie , if you can read Andy 's musings at length in his books , or attend one of his excellent lectures ? This medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artist 's works , and is used expertly in this respect .  
  this has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that I 've ever seen on screen . Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction . he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it 's primitive in a good sense . his purity , honesty and kindness breathes clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life momentary pieces of art . I was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end . sometimes prematurely , but his Scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly . the film is shoot elegantly and contains the same flow that Goldsworthy 's art has . it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself . Fred Frith 's score is organic enough that it blends everything together without interfering with it naturalistic sound . this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect . it has no boundaries as far as age goes .  
  Andy Goldsworthy is a taoist master of the first order , expressing the Way through his sublime ephemeral art . Indeed , time and change is what his work is fundamentally about . I bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled at it many times . So it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film , he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect , and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world , the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all . He is like most children who play in the great outdoors alone ( if they do anymore ) , creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it . Mr . Goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to extend that sort of play to create profound visions of nature , and to open our often weary eyes to it in brilliant new ways . And always with the utmost respect , gratitude and humor of a wandering , and wondering monk .  
  I saw this many years after the television series and , initially , I didn't care for it . Then , as my memory of the series receded with the passage of time , I watched again , and found it absolutely hilarious . Based on the stage play by Neil Simon , it has not been ' opened out ' much for the big screen , and that 's one of its strengths . Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felix , and the supporting cast are wonderful , particularly John Fielder as ' Vinnie ' . Even now , certain moments can reduce me to tears of laughter - Felix interrupting Oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request , Oscar cracking up and chasing Felix around the apartment , the giggling ' Pigeon Sisters ' brought low by Felix 's sob stories , and of course , the legendary cafeteria scene ( later ripped off by Nora Ephron 's ' When Harry Met Sally ' ) . Razor-sharp dialogue too . When the boys think Felix has taken an overdose , Oscar says : " They could be vitamins ! He could be the healthiest one in the room ! " . Fantastic !  
  this movie is a masterpiece a story of a young woman during the war , and it really happen , not exactly as the movie , but it is a great story , i was impress by this film , the acting and the story where great i like this film because it is a true story it 's Giff me a feeling that i was there and i feel sorry for the ca-rector that Maruschka Detmers is playing because who wants to end here life that way . i recommend that everybody have to see this film , special the young ones and ma by the learn something from this film . This film you can compare whit the movie soldier from orange or any real story that happened in the WW2 .  
  It sounds a bit awkward to call a film about war and holocaust shocking since many of us will know only too well of the horrors that war and violence brings . By using the adjective ' shocking ' I do not intend to imply that I am surprised about the things told about in this film or that I was formerly unaware of them , it is just that I am very much impressed by the way in which this film shows how crazy and incomprehensibly horrific it is to kill each other off , either with or without a ' reason ' . The first part of the film focuses on Hanna 's successful participation in the Hungarian resistance . Maruschka Detmers would never have won an Oscar for this performance , due to inconsistent directing , but still her acting is solid enough and she has enormous charisma . She is cast very well as Hanna and immediately has our sympathy . Her very beautiful looks help , of course , but that has nothing to do with her being simply a good actress , playing a good part . Certain inconsistencies keep occurring in Hanna 's War . I sometimes get the idea director Menahem Golan ( often despised for The Gianni Versace Murder ) was in a rush and should actually have allowed a few more takes per scene . On the other hand , I am very thankful he made this impressive and thought-provoking film and as I am very positive about it , I think he did a good job . The second half of the film is the most interesting and tragic one . It focuses on Hanna 's suffering ( beware of Donald Pleasence 's scary portrayal of the cruel and sardonic captain Rosza ) and intensely shows the injustice and horror that comes with hate and violence and war . I receive Hanna 's War , especially the second half , as a strong anti-war film and for that alone Golan deserves credit . It is also this second half in which Maruschka Detmer 's talent comes out , creating a character which goes into film history as one of the most speaking , strong and tragic ever portrayed . It is also great to see Ellen Burstyn , whose appearance and acting style always remind me of Romy Schneider , who - had she been alive and cast - would have made a similar effective contribution to Hanna 's War . The tragic impact of the second half and the desperate tension which is sometimes replaced by hopeful prospects and good news lead to a number of final scenes which show something so unexpected , so moving and poetic in its tragedy that it hit me like a bomb and left me in tears . And when I realized once more it wasn't even fiction , it all actually happened , I found myself in even more tears . The image of Hanna portrayed by Maruschka Detmers will be in my mind forever .  
  Man , I loved this movie ! This really takes me back to when I was a kid . These were the days when the teachers still showed classroom films on reel-to-real and if you were good , they would rewind the movie slowly so you could watch it play backward . I still remember one of the opening lines .. " Tutazema was his name , and he was an Orphan . He lived with his sister so and so in the village . " This is a great movie for kids and as enduring as the red balloon . At the end the other Indian boys in the village attach the feathers to Tutazema and he becomes an eagle himself . He gets to live the way he always wanted to . He gets to soar the heavens .  
  I 've also been looking to find this movie for quite some time , and how great it would be to find it on DVD .. I saw this movie when I was about 6 years old , in the Netherlands . And I was very impressed by it . It was shown before Walt Disney 's JUNGLE BOOK ! What I remember of this movie is fragmented . I remember that an Indian boy was friends with an eagle . This impressed me very much . For some reason he was thrown out of his village ( did not grasp the reason for this ) . When other boys threw stones at him , he climbed a rock and jumped off . At that time he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend . As an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace . CB  
  I have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and I would first like to say that I understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well : viewed from an Israeli perspective , I can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie . What I would like to say is that ' Distortion ' was shown at a film festival in Geneva in November 2005 ( Festival ' Cinéma tout écran ' ) where it won the award of the audience ( ' Prix du public'in French ) . For what affects me , I liked the ' nervous camera ' work of Mr Bouzaglo , who , in my opinion , portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well , and I think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie . This perspective , however , might seem totally ' alien ' to an Israeli viewer , but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers , because Switzerland is a country which has NEVER been subject to any terrorist attack . It therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in Geneva judged this film with a much more ' detached ' perspective . I would also like to quote what Mr Bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a Geneva newspaper ( I 'm translating from French ) : ' After 50 years of living here and after undergoing all this violence , we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal . We might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living . We are like the characters in my movie , ' on the edge of the edge ' . This is the reason why the private detective , who is somehow ' voyeur ' is the happiest character in the movie , because he earns a living thanks to the system , he takes advantage of this situation ' This is , in substance , the main thing that I and the swiss public , in my opinion , pointed out in this movie , and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor . So , to sum up , different country = different perspective , but I think that this is somehow great , because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema , that is to say that it well never be subject to a ' unique ' of ' formatted ' way of thinking .  
  I had fun watching Red Eye . It 's not a masterpiece , but it 's well directed and structured . Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role . Yes , it 's the same old story with a different setting but Wes Craven gave it a good pace . At least not another Scream with the usual college killer . It 's nice when you can see a clean , coherent thriller even when originality doesn't stand out as its main character . Particularly from a film-maker like Craven that has brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and that now just lends himself to bringing home what could have been a good TV movie had it not been released theatrically . Good job !  
  This is a cute little horror spoof / comedy featuring Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira : Mistress of the Dark , the most infamous horror hostess of all time . This was meant to be the pilot vehicle for Elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the NBC Network . They filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit-com never made it past the pilot stage due to it 's sexual references . This film however , is very amusing . Elvira is the modern-day Chesty Morgan and the queen of the one-liners . This film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal " Elvira 's Haunted Hills " which was meant to be a take-off of the old Roger Corman movies but falls flat on it 's face . Watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience !  
  Elvira , Mistress of The Dark , is a fun , camp horror comedy , in which the fourth wall is broken a couple of times and the jokes often stay below the navel . And the breasts of Cassandra Peterson become a character of their own . Elvira ( Cassandra Peterson ) is stacked horror show hostess , who learns , that she has inherited her aunt Morgana . So she goes to a little town of Fallwell , which is ruled by the most horrendous monster ever to embrace the earth : Morality comity . Elviras boobacious appearance is , of course , too much for the prunes , but the kids of the town get a kick out of her different kind of approach on life . And of course there is even more sinister evil , her uncle Vincent ( William Morgan Sheppard ) , who is after Elvira 's mothers book of spells . See , Elvira actually is a real witch , she just doesn't know it . Yet . For what it is , Elvira is quite funny film , even though the script does leave a lot of room for improvement . Most laughs come from the difference between Elvira and the people of good morals , but there are a couple of good visual gags as well . Over all direction is okay , but it never rises to be anything more than that . In all , a good , intentionally campy , comedy . If you like this kind of thing , that is .  
  if you have a chance of seeing this film do see it . it 's quite shocking in parts and really makes you think about so many important issues but it 's not didactic . in my opinion it 's a piece of art .. beautifully filmed , fine music of many styles , the typically impressive level of acting that one has come to expect from BBC Drama . Nathalie Press ( billed as ' Natalie ' Press ) is convincing in her role as depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate . Celia Imrie has that beautifully reassuring quality that gives the sometimes unnerving action stability and the viewer comfort in the knowledge that someone out there is actually ' normal ' , but the real star as always is Timothy Spall - surely one of the greatest actors of our time !  
  Kurt Russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past glories , Reno Hightower . Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as Jack Dundee . He dropped the Big Pass in more ways than one . You 'll see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into one film , as Jack hisses at a rat , Reno poses , and the call of the caribou goes out . Don't miss this classic that isn't scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played .  
  Why did this movie fail commercially ? It 's got a sharp script ( by Ron Shelton ) and great performances by Kurt Russell and , especially , Robin Williams , in a brilliant manic nerd turn that 's different from any of his other work . A great renter .  
  This is a documentary I came across by chance on the UK TV channel More4 and I have to say I found it extremely interesting and thought provoking . I will also be seeking out the book that was the source material for this documentary . Basically this is Professor Jared Diamond theory on why certain parts of the earth 's societies prospered and others did not . The argument he presents was new to me and argued about how the fortune of the right crops and the right animals that where able to domesticated is certainly a compelling one . As for the documentary itself it is well shot and well narrated with not to much of the re-created scenes that spoil many a modern documentary . Diamond also helps by not being to condescending which is a fault of a lot of intellectuals when trying to get a message to the masses . People have claimed his theory is Marxist but I do not buy this and see it more socio geologist . It was also refreshing to hear an theory on the evolution of society not based around religion . Highly recommended viewing .  
  Just given the fact that it is based on the most infamous mass suicide incident of modern times would have been enough to give this 2-part 1980 made-for-TV film attention . But the fact is that it is a superb recreation of the life of the Rev . Jim Jones , who built a church into a virtual empire , and then encouraged it to disintegrate into a sleazy cult in which a Congressman and his entourage were assassinated , and 917 cult followers committed suicide by drinking Kool-Aid doused with cyanide . Done very tastefully but horrifying enough , unlike the excruciatingly sadistic CULT OF THE DAMNED , GUYANA TRAGEDY features an all-star cast , including Ned Beatty ( as Rep . Leo Ryan ) , Meg Foster , Randy Quaid , Brad Dourif , Brenda Vaccaro , LeVar Burton , and Madge Sinclair . But it is Powers Boothe ( in his first big role ) that really stands out as Jim Jones . He actually BECOMES the man , and his performance is riveting and chilling . Thus , it is no wonder that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years .  
  Rented the movie as a joke . My friends and I had so much fun laughing at it that I went and found a used copy and bought it for myself . Now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie I give them Sasquatch Hunters . It needs to be said though there is a rule that was made that made the movie that much better . No talking is allowed while the movie is on unless the words are Sasquatch repeated in a chant . I loved the credit at the end of the movie as well . " Thanks for the Jeep , Tom ! " Whoever Tom is I say thank you because without your Jeep the movie may not have been made . In short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at . If you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you don't mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit grab yourself a copy .  
  I was going to give it an 8 , but since you people made 6.5 out of a lot better votes , I had to up my contribution . The river Styx was pure genius . Sure , Woody was his perennial stuff , but at least his role was appropriate . The first half hour was really hilarious , and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch . The dialog was clever enough , and Woody 's card tricks at the parties , along with the reaction from the upper crust , were fun to watch . This was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be . And a plus , a little Sorcerer 's Apprentice to go along with it . And of course , did you notice that Johansen is getting a bit frumpy ? Charles Dance is always entertaining , as was Hugh Jackman .  
  " Scoop " is easily Woody Allen 's funniest film of the 2000 's so far . Allen , although finally looking his age , is at the top of his game as low-brow magician Sidney Waterman . His one-liners and demeanor are hilarious . Don't let the critics sway your opinion . " Scoop " is a top notch " Woody-Lite " picture . The classical music score is an excellent compliment to the action on screen . Scarlett Johanson looks gorgeous in that bathing suit . Jackman is dashing . The cinematography glows . " Scoop " is wonderful escapist fare from start to finish . The last shot of the film alone is worth the admission price .  
  I loved this show growing up and I still watch the first season DVD at age 19 today . What can I say ? I grew up in a house much like the one on Full House . I had a dad , two sisters , and a dog . I guess the only difference was that I did not live with my uncle and my dad 's best friend . Also , I grew up with my mom in the house . I don't know what I would have done without Full House on television . I think that Stephanie ( played by Jodie Sweetin ) , D.J. ( played by Kirk Cameron 's sister Candace ) , and Michelle ( Played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen ) are my favorite characters . I can relate to each of them because I am the middle child of my family like Steph , I am a younger sister like Michelle , and I am an older sister like D.J. I really like how the show always has moral values because I don't really like any of the O.C.-like shows today . I like the comedy of Full House , too . Uncle Jesse ( John Stamos ) , Joey ( Dave Coulier ) , and Danny ( Bob Saget ) are hilarious as the girls ' uncle , dad 's friend , and dad , respectively . The story goes that , after the girls ' mom dies , Danny 's best friend Joey and his brother-in-law , Jesse move in to help raise the kids . Three men trying to raise three young girls = hilarious . Each character on Full House is full of heart , funny , and genuinely believable . Joey is an aspiring comedian with a kid 's heart and soul . Jesse is the cool , motorcycle riding , tough-guy uncle who is softened by his three nieces , and later , his wife Becky ( Laurie Laughlin , from Summerville ) . Both kids and adults will love this show . Guaranteed .  
  This show is about three little girls . ( D.J , Stephanie , and Michelle ) Their Mother is killed by a drunk driver so their father Danny invites his Brother-in-law ( Jesse ) and his Old Friend ( Joey ) . So the whole show is about living life . The girls go through life 's troubles and have life lessons . They develop crushes , boyfriends , and many more . The whole show is basically about to go with the flow . You do not have to hold grudges you just have to let it go . I think this show is really good and fun to watch . I grew up watching this show and still watch it today . I am glad they still air this show on television . I watch it almost every day . I rate it 10/10 .  
  I used to watch this show when I was a little girl . When I think about it , I only remember it vaguely . If you ask me , it was a good show . Two things I remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song . In addition to that , everyone was ideally cast . Also , the writing was very strong . The performances were top-grade , too . I hope some network brings it back so I can see every episode . Before I wrap this up , I 'd like to say that I 'll always remember this show in my memory forever , even though I don't think I 've seen every episode . Now , in conclusion , if some network ever brings it back , I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good .  
  Have no illusions , this IS a morality story . Granger is the troubled ex-buffalo hunter , tempted back to the plains one more time by kill-crazed Taylor . Granger can see the end is near , and feels deeply for the cost of the hunt-on the herds , the Indians and the land itself . Taylor , on the other hand admittedly equates killing buffalo , or Indians to ' being with a woman . ' While Granger 's role of the tortured hunter is superb , it 's Taylor who steals the show , as the demented , immoral ' everyman ' out for the fast buck and the goodtimes . There 's not a lot of bang-bang here , but the story moves along quickly , and we are treated to a fine character performance by Nolan . The theme of this story is just as poignant today , as in the 1800s-man 's relationship to the land and what 's on it , and racism . Considering when this was made , the Censors must have been wringing their hankies during the scenes in the ' bawdy house ' , Taylor 's relationship with the squaw , and much of the dialogue . Although downbeat , this is truly a great western picture .  
  Every kid has that movie that he pops into VHS when he has nothing to do , or when there is a babysitter around . This was that movie for me . I can tell you the whole plot exactly , I must have seen it 100 times at least , and I can say it is a good kids / family movie . I still have the tape , I haven't watched it in 5 years , but maybe I 'll get around to it this week , and be a kid for the day . You just have to love the care bears , and their messege .  
  I first remember seeing this one back in the 70s when it was shown on late night television . Scared the hell out of me . But then , I was a teenager back in those days , not as jaded about films as I am now . CASTLE OF BLOOD ( aka : DANSE MACABRE ) is a fine example of the 60s Italian horror genre , along with Mario Bava 's BLACK SUNDAY ( 1960 ) , CURSE OF THE LIVING DEAD ( aka : KILL BABY KILL ) ( 1966 ) and Mario Caiano 's NIGHTMARE CASTLE ( 1965 ) . If you want spooky atmosphere along with great writing , then check these out as well . I also rate these along with those early Poe films that Roger Corman was doing during the same period . I saw the new Synapse DVD that was taken from a French print and it 's a great improvement over that old pan-and-scan print that was making the rounds on television over the years . It adds a couple of minutes of dialog ( in French ) that don't really add much to the movie as whole , but it 's nice to see it complete , without cuts . Unfortunately the DVD doesn't really offer any extras beyond stills from the film . One flub I noticed was in the opening scene , seeing the smoke-effects man next to the camera being reflected on the glass of the inn 's front door . I guess the editors didn't catch it at the time , or maybe they didn't care , but it is something I didn't notice the first time . That 's the wonders of DVD . You get to see all the flubs , mistakes and details that weren't apparent the first time around . But no matter . But no matter , it still gets a 7 on the imdb meter  
  Today actresses happily gain weight , dye their hair , dress like slobs , and lose their glamor for a role , and Bette Davis was probably the actress who started the trend . Even as a pretty young woman who occasionally wore designer clothes and Constance Bennett-type makeup in films , Davis was willing to ravage herself in order to create a character on the outside as well as the inside . Her determination is amply demonstrated here in her breakout film , " Of Human Bondage , " in which she stars with Leslie Howard as Philip Carey . Davis plays Mildred , a slutty , manipulative , greedy low-life to Howard 's masochistic , club-footed Philip . He first meets her when she 's a waitress , and she allows him to take her out to dinner and theater while she frolics with a wealthy older man ( Alan Hale Sr . ) . In truth , Mildred is repulsed by Philip 's club foot . On his part , Philip seems to enjoy the abuse of her open flirtation and her coolness toward him . He allows Mildred to bleed him dry financially in between boyfriends who drop her when they tire of her , while he blows off a couple of truly lovely women ( Kay Johnson and Frances Dee ) . When he gets the gumption to throw her out , Mildred trashes his apartment and robs him , forcing him to withdraw from medical school and lose his lodgings . " Of Human Bondage " looks rather stilted today in parts . Though Leslie Howard was a wonderful actor and attractive , his acting style is of a more formal old school , and as a result , he tends to date whatever he 's in . He shines in material like his role opposite Davis in " It 's Love I 'm After " or " The Petrified Forest " which call for his kind of technique . His dated acting is even more obvious here because Davis was forging new ground with a gritty , edgy performance that would really make her name . If she seems at times over the top , she came from the stage , and the subtleties of film acting would emerge later for her . Contrast this performance with the restraint , warmth and gentleness of her Henriette in " All This , and Heaven Too " or the pathos she brought to " Dark Victory . " She was a true actress and a true artist . Davis really allows herself to look like holy hell ; Mildred 's deterioration is absolutely pathetic as Philip seems to gain strength as her spirit fades . An excellent film in which to see the burgeoning of one of film 's greatest stars .  
  Reading web sites on Bette Davis one can find instances where authors claim that there is nothing special about her acting . I even found a site which claimed that Bette Davis ' success was probably due to her luck . But Ms Davis films of 1934 tell quite the opposite . The most evident example are two films that she did only few weeks apart : Fog over Frisco and On Human Bondage . Characters she played in these movies , though both being negative , are quite different . Arlene in the former is a beautiful , glamorous and frivolous heiress and much more likable character than Mildred in the latter , which is a pale , uneducated and impudent Cockney waitress . Needless to say that Ms Davis played both characters very authentic and with the same enthusiasm . But even that is not all . The point is that the former role , which would be wished by most actresses of the day , was the one she was forced to play . The latter role , which seemed to most actresses as undesirable , career destroying role , was the one she fought for ferociously for months . And it was the latter role that launched her among the greatest stars . So there is no question that Ms Davis knew from the start what she was doing . The film , which tells about a medical student Phillip Carey ( Leslie Howard ) which falls unhappily in love with Cockney waitress Mildred Rogers ( Bette Davis ) , has a few week points , but many more strong ones . The story is simply too big to be told in mere 83 minutes . For example , it is quite unclear why refined student found any interest in an impudent waitress in the first place . Well , there is one scene in which we are exposed to Ms Davis captivating eyes , but this is when his emotions are already fully evolved . Nevertheless , the integrity of the story is preserved by superior acting from Howard and Davis as well as fantastic Steiner 's music which tells tons of emotions even when we do not see characters ' faces . In fact the film is amalgamated by Phillip 's walking sequences showing him from the back supplemented with shuddering two-tone repetition . Every detail is well thought - Max Steiner wrote a beautiful leitmotif for each women in Phillip 's life , which is consistently used through the film . And a beautiful scene in which we see Sally 's face in front of calendar is one of the sweetest scenes I 've ever seen exactly due to Francis Dee 's breathtaking beauty ( Ms Dee was by the way considered to be too beautiful to play leading role in Gone with a Wind ) as well as Steiner 's captivating music . Camera movements between the some scenes is also original and refreshing . But my strongest objection is that events are presented too two-dimensionally , which induce viewer that Mildred is an ultimate slut . The most disgusting characters ought to be men which lure her into relationship , despite well knowing that they will abandon her after taking use of her , but they , curiously , finished portrayed as likable characters . After all , Mildred always - in her own specific , but still a honest way - lets Phillip know that she despises him and had no interest in him . Which he just refuses to hear . It is Phillips masochistic nature connected to his club foot and infantile experiences that is the principal reason of his love problem . He is enslaved to his club foot as much as to Mildred and perhaps has to be free of both to start a normal life . Of course , selfish and impudent Mildred , after discovering voluntary Phillip 's bondage to her , did its own share to make his life hell . Even taking into account that she exploded after realizing that the bondage has loosen , it is less than clear why would she burn Phillip 's money ( Maugham intended different in his novel ) . After all , she could as well steal it and drunk gallons of champagne . For modern standards the film is a bit outdated , but each subsequent time you watch it , you can reveal new interesting details due to superior acting , fascinating music and original editing , so it does deserve the highest possible mark .  
  I saw this film again and noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore the part about Cary 's [ Leslie Howard ] childhood . Considering that at the time not much can be shown on the screen , [ not that there is much in the novel ] the obsession of the character with Mildred [ Bette Davis ] is very well conveyed to the audience . I recommend this film to anyone who ever fell for another person and the other side tried to take advantage of him or her . I have read that Maugham was asked to make a recording of the novel for sale , but when he started to in the studio he began crying and could not finish more than a few lines and whole project was chucked . One can tell the novel is written from the heart and the film is a good adaptation of a part of it at least .  
  Coming shortly before the imposition of a morality code darkened the spirits of writers , directors and actors , the first film adaptation of W . Somerset Maugham 's " Of Human Bondage " titillated countless moviegoers . It has no shock value today , just fine acting . While the cast is excellent , this is Bette Davis 's first great role and one of Leslie Howard 's best performances . Howard is English wannabe Parisian artist Philip Carey who is gently and firmly told that he lacks any talent and that his dedication is no substitute for true genius . Taking the lesson to heart he returns to London and enrolls in a medical college ( one , by the way , that seems to have no female students-at that time there would have been at least a few . Perhaps author / physician Maugham didn't care for distaff medicos ) . Having tea one day Carey is entranced by a waitress , Mildred Rogers , Bette Davis in a role as a morally loose and basically wicked farrago . Her Cockney accent is as sharp as Eliza Doolittle 's . His repeated attempts to date her are greeted with the less than enthusiastic reply , " I don't mind , " a sure sign for any man with his head screwed on straight that he 's plumbing the depths . Maugham 's Mildred supplemented her waitress tips with a bit of old fashioned street-walking , something not clearly brought out here . Carey 's besotted prostration serves Rogers ' avaricious need for support of the financial kind . He is desperately in love with her-she plays him as a Sunday church organist effortlessly plies her instrument . No sex here . Recognizing that he is getting nowhere , he begins a chaste relationship with Norah , a woman who adores him . Re-enter Mildred , replete with a baby , and in her usual need of being taken care of . Exit heartbroken Norah . Another separation from Mildred and Carey begins a long-term friendship with Sally , abetted enthusiastically by her dad who seems to view eventual marriage as both a good thing for the two young people and a chance to be relieved of one of his nine offspring . The movie reasonably but not entirely follows Maugham 's excellent novel . Howard 's Carey is naive and vulnerable and for much of the movie his sad eyes remind one of a doe facing a double-barreled shotgun . Mildred is unrestrainedly wicked , a user of the worst kind , her sole preoccupation with her own needs barely disguised when she tries to wheedle Carey with a thin patina of affectionate words ( and offers-at one point she promises she 'll do " anything [ he ] wants , " a daring statement for the times and one I 'm sure audiences fully understood . Pre-Code it may be but Mildred 's quick-march dissolution would have satisfied the League of Catholic Decency . The ending is conventional-sin loses , principled behavior triumphs . Director John Cromwell wrought excellent performances from his two main stars , one well-established , the other established largely because of this film . The atmosphere is 1930s London and the trip back in time is worth taking . Available on DVD . 9/10 ( for Davis 's and Howard 's performances )  
  Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung-Fu movies which Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s , whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood , and the protagonist Gordon Liu , the counterpart to the western 's Clint Eastwood . Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest , this is " Presented in Shaw Scope " , just like the good old days . This film is a simple story of good versus evil , told in 3 acts , which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era . Act One sets up the premise . Workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot , having their wages cut by 20 % by incoming manchu gangsters . They can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters , and their boss . At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk ( one of the best comedy sequences ) , but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times . Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob . However , without real martial arts , he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple , to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly . After some slapstick moments , he finally gets accepted by the abbot ( whom he impersonated ! ) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like Mr Miyagi 's style in Karate Kid , but instead of painting fences , he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple . Nothing can keep a good man down , and he unwittingly builds strength , endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way . Act Three is where the fight fest begins . With cheesy sound effects , each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment . But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here , with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners , and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles . You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow , with some pause in between moves , but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad-nausem in Hollywood flicks , they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to ! Return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on Monday , so , if you 're game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane , what are you waiting for ?  
  I agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best Kung Fu movies ever ! I watched this as a kid and absolutely loved it ! The scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really empathise with this guy because he is treated as an outcast . Nice humour and fantastic kung fu this movie rocks ! If you like Kung Fu you would love this !  
  On the night of his bachelor party , Paul Coleman ( Jason Lee ) meets the gorgeous dancer Becky ( Julia Stiles ) in the bar , they drink a lot together and in the next morning , he wakes up with her on the bed . His future mother-in-law calls him and informs that his fiancée Karen ( Selma Blair ) might be arriving in his apartment , and he desperately asks Becky to leave his place in a hurry . Sooner , he finds that her has crabs , and later , in the preparation of his wedding dinner party , he realizes that Becky is the cousin of Karen . This is the beginning of a very funny comedy , with hilarious situations . The first attraction of this movie certainly is the central trio of actresses and actor . Julia Stiles and Selma Blair , who are excellent actresses and extremely gorgeous , and Jason Lee , who is amazingly funny , have good performances . I laughed a lot along the story , but there are some scenes that are really hilarious . For example , when Paul finds Becky in his bed ; when he finds her paints ; his imagination in many situations ; in the drugstore , trying to buy and get explanations about the crab medicine ; most of the scenes of his neighbor , the minister ; when Karen calls the department store ; or when the police finds a suspect of assaulting Paul . I could number many other scenes , but better off the reader rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun . My vote is seven . Title ( Brazil ) : " Louco Por Elas " ( " Crazy For Them " )  
  In my opinion , A GUY THING is a hilarious , witty , sexy , romantic , and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy . I thought that Jason Lee and Julia Stiles dazzled as a bewildered groom-to-be and his soon-to-be sexy cousin-in-law . If you ask me , they lit up the screen like magic . You can also feel their chemistry between them . Before I wrap this up , I 'd like to say that the performances were top grade , the direction was flawless , the production design was nice , the casting was perfect , and the costumes were perfectly designed . In conclusion , to anyone who 's a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles , I recommend this movie . You 're in for lots of laughs and thrills , so , go to the video store , rent it or buy it , kick back with a friend , and watch it .  
  Neatly sandwiched between THE STRANGER , a small film noir picture that proved Welles can do a formidable genre work on budget and on time and ironically proved his biggest box office success in the forties , and MACBETH , a no-budget Shakespeare adaptation shot in old western shets in 23 days , comes THE LADY FROM SHANGAI , a dark film noir woven from the very same fabric of Wellesian mythos that covers THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS , MR . ARKADIN and any other film the director didn't manage to save from the clutches of studio bosses . Six years after THE MALTESE FALCON , with the post-war craze of the film noir in full swing , Welles , always ahead of his time , a true visionary director of tremendous artistic integrity , envisioned a labyrinthine world of shadows that is already darker , more sinister , paranoid and serpentine than anything his contemporaries were doing at the time . It 's no wonder the movie was so misunderstood at its time , to the point that one full hour of footage was forever left in the cutting room floor , and it was once again Europe that championed it as another Welles classic . Certain set-pieces stand out . The aquarium scene with its flickering light and ominous shadows , and of course the Funhouse / Hall of Mirrors finale that is as classic a piece of Wellesian bravura as any in CITIZEN KANE or THE TRIAL . The only faults I find with the movie is Welles ' ill-advised Irish accent and perhaps some of the erratic editing in the first act . The story however unfurls in a progressively mesmerizing manner , which the cuts only serve to intensify . I believe the heavily chopped versions of Shangai and Ambersons attain a surreal quality for that matter . Welles would exile himself in Europe for ten years and return in 1958 to deliver yet another stonewall classic , the monumental TOUCH OF EVIL , perhaps the crowning jewel of the film noir that was already in its waning days by that time . Shangai was not the box office success a star vehicle for Hollywood 's premiere star of the time , Rita Hayworth , ought to have been , and Welles marriage with Hayworth ended before the movie was even released . Sixty years later and one hour of footage less , Shangai is still one of the best film noir pictures one is likely to discover . Surely that must count for something .  
  I loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end . I found the director / actor 's style of directly addressing me / the audience very engaging . What I found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its ignoring - and thus challenging - of gender and class stereotypes . The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths , and the absence of judgment - and the characters ' acceptance of themselves and each other - enabled me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world . Without preaching , and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor , this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities , and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals . I look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director .  
  Very good drama about a young girl who attempts to unravel a series of horrible crimes . She enlists the aid of a police cadet , and they begin running down a series of clues which lead to a traveling carny worker with a long police record . An ending which is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat .  
  If you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot , then this film is NOT for you . Nope-you 'll hate it . However , for those who like sweet , slightly screwball comedies , then you 'll have a nice time watching this slight film . Tony Randall works for the IRS and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return . However hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit , everyone in the family is thrilled to have company . They dote on him and treat him like one of the family , .. and have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter , Debbie Reynolds . That 's really about all the plot there is . But the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting . A really nice little curio from the late 1950s .  
  As winter approaches , our state-owned broadcaster , the ABC , has decided for some reason to have a partial Jane Austen Festival on Sunday nights . This commenced with a twelve-year old movie length version of " Emma " last Sunday ; more recent versions of three other novels , " Persuasion " , " Northanger Abbey " and " Mansfield Park " are to come . The curious thing about this production by A & E Television Networks , with script by the ever-reliable Andrew Davies , is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much bigger budget movie versions , one starring Gwyneth Paltrow , and " Clueless " , a " modernized " version , starring Alicia Silverstone , which transported the plot to Beverly Hills . Perhaps as a result , even with Kate Beckinsale in the lead , this production sank without trace . As a general rule , much is lost when novels are shrunk to fit feature movie length . The adaptations one tends to both enjoy and remember are those which have adequate room to develop both story and characters . An outstanding example is " Brideshead Revisited " which had 13 50-minute episodes back in 1982 . You only have to compare the very ordinary movie-length version of " Pride and Prejudice " in 2005 with the brilliant 1995 six-part TV mini-series . It 's not that a novel should be filmed page by page , and some novels ( often not very good ones ) adapt wonderfully to film ( " Atonement " is a recent example ) , but novels of the Jane Austen sort need some time and space to exert their full charm . Given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation , this production is OK . Kate Beckinsale gives Emma the right mix of self-assuredness and vulnerability and Mark Strong is a forthright Mr Knightly ( he reminded me that Jane tended to recycle characters  Knightly is a more articulate version of the moody Mr Darcy of P & P ) . Samantha Morton was a rather limp Harriet but Prunella Scales got the blabbermouth Miss Bates perfectly  Sybil Fawlty on speed . Bernard Hepton as Emma 's feeble father was also excellent . We saw the damp countryside , the mud and the poverty as well as the posh interiors , in case anyone thought this was a particularly idyllic age for everybody . Even though this was a condensed adaptation it was oddly slow in places  some of the conversations were rather stilted , even allowing for the formalities of the times . I 'd have to look at the film again to be sure , but it might be due to the under-use of reaction shots . If you do like filmed period stuff this is a perfectly nice example , and compares well with the Paltrow version . Anyway , there is more to come !  
  Tintin and I recently aired as an episode of PBS 's P.O.V. series . It 's based on a taped interview of Georges Remi a . k . a . Herge , Tintin 's creator , from 1971 in which in discusses his various experiences publishing his popular character , first in a Catholic newspaper , then in his own series of comic books . Awesome sweeping views of various comic pages and surreal images of Herge 's dreams . I first encountered Tintin in the pages of Children 's Digest at my local elementary school library reading The Secrets of the Unicorn . My mom later got a subscription to CD and I read the entire Red Rackham 's Treasure every month in 1978 . I remember seeing some Tintin comic books in a local book store after that but for some reason I didn't get any probably because I was 12 and I thought I was outgrowing them . I do have Breaking Free , a book written and drawn by J . Daniels , published in 1989 , six years after Herge 's death . Haven't read it yet . This film also covers the artist 's personal life as when he left his first wife after his affair with a colorist in his employ ( whom he later married ) . Her name is Fanny and she is interviewed here . If you love Tintin and his creator , this film is definitely worth a look . Update : 9/4/07-I 've now read Breaking Free . Tintin and The Captain are the only regular characters that appear here and they are tailored to the anti-capitalist views of Mr . Daniels with Tintin portrayed as a rabble rouser with a chip on his shoulder who nevertheless cares for The Captain who he 's staying with . The Captain here is just trying to make ends meet with a wife and daughter that he loves dearly . They and other construction workers vow to strike after a fellow employee dies from a faulty equipment accident . The whole thing takes place in England with working-class cockney accents intact . Not the kind of thing Herge would approve of but an interesting read nonetheless . Oh , yes , dog Snowy only appears in the top left corner of the cover ( which has Tintin running over the police ! ) and the dedication page .  
  If you as I have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin .. do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about Hergé and his life creating Tintin . I'ts so brilliant and a very cool production . The whole background story about Hergé and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by , for good and worse is amazing . There is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this . I will for sure be in my basement digging up the Tintin albums again . Also , the movie itself are very well told and has a great ambient sound to it . I really do hope people will find this as intriguing as I did !  
  I think it 's one of the greatest movies which are ever made , and I 've seen many .. The book is better , but it 's still a very good movie !  
  this movie just goes to show that you dont need big explosions , muti-billion dollar computer graphics , or highly over paid actors and actresses to make a good movie , All you need is a excellent story line and plot . which the master of all japanese films , Akira Kurosawa pulls off brilliantly . I recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece . and for those that enjoy Kurosawas earlier works . 10/10  
  A tragically wonderful movie .. brings us to a Japan that does not exist anymore . Despite Hollywood 's technical expertise , I have yet to see a ( hollywood ) movie that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town by the river near the sea .. Tom Cruise 's The Last Samurai looked liked the last installment of the Lord of The Rings in trying to capture rural Old Japan . If you like serene but intense story lines , this is a must see film . It will be a respite from hollow flashy films much like the last 1000 blockbusters you saw . I think this is one of Kurosawa 's better stories . Even if it 's a movie about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such settings , it did not turn into a skin flick . The characters are full of depth and act with much intensity .  
  This movie was good for it 's time . If you like Eddie Murpy this is a must have to add to your collection . Eddie was young and funny with his 80 's haircut . Charlotte Lewis , Eddie 's costar is hot . This was one of her first movies and she was not bad . The graphics were good for the 80 's . A lot of the actors went on to do other good movies you should check them out through IMDb . Other must have from Eddie is " Coming to America " and " 48 hours " . Another actor " Victor Wong " has a small part in this movie . Check out some of his older movies like " Big trouble in little china " . If you liked the action movies from the 80 's this is your movie .  
  ' The second beginning ' as it 's title explains , shows us the beginning of the end for the human race . Set long before the matrix existed , this short anime written by the Wachowski 's shows us the world that could lay infront of us in the not to distant future , set at the turn of the 21st century , the second renaissance delves into issues common with human behaviour ; greed , power , control , vanity etc . The use of robots or artificial intellegence as slaves or servents is common among science fiction / fantasy stories . The second renaissance is no exeption to this concept , however instead of a simple man vs . machine layout , this story explains the struggle that the machines put up with , the struggle for acceptance in a world ruled by humans . Where the matrix films show us the human perspective , these short animations tell both sides of the story . The second renaissance part 1 + 2 , answer many questions brought up by the original Matrix film , such as how the war broke out , how the sky was blackend , what led to the use of humans as batteries and it also introduces us to the machine city called 01 , which may have relevance to the upcoming Matrix Revolutions film . I won't give away too much of the story , as I do not want to ruin the experience for perspective viewers , however , I will recommend it to anybody interested in the world of the matrix or simply anybody interested in Japanese animation ( anime ) . 9/10 .  
  What was always missing with the Matrix story was how things came to be in the real world . Say no more , because this part of the story covered most of the bases . What was truly interesting was how political it was , maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration . Fascism and violence were the only things man could think of in regards to fighting the robotic horde , who were meant as nothing more than servants to humanity . What I also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of the unknown . We as humans tend to fall into that trap quite often , letting the lack of logic and thought overtake us because people can't believe the contrary . Well represented and put together , this a true testament to how illogical humans can be .  
  I was living Rawlins when this movie was made and I got lucky enough to be able to work on it . Both as an extra and with Eddie Surkin on special effects . It was fun to see all the behind the scene workings , from the Barbedwire coming alive to the Electric chair up through the wardens office floor . Also it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors , from Viggo to Tiny . Also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called " Disney Gate " by locals . If anybody is interested and is ever in Rawlins , most of the movies sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour . It was a lot of fun working for and with R . Harlin and wished I had a chance to do it again .  
  I love this film . It is well written and acted and has good cinematography . The story blends action , humor , mysticism , and tenderness with great sets and beautiful location shots . See it , buy it , show it to your friends . The acting is good and Murphy especially does a fine job portraying the reluctant / unlikely hero . I enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions . I cared what happened to these people and , while the outcome was pretty predictable ( the good guys win , the hero gets the astonishingly attractive girl and the holy child saves lives-who doesn't see that coming ? ) , it still made me happy when everything worked out well in the end . Thank God this film 's dignity was never ruined with a crappy sequel . Grab some popcorn , cuddle up on the couch , and watch this fun , happy and entertaining film .  
  Having heard of Modesty Blaise before , but never having read a novel or a comic strip , my wife and I liked the film a lot . It delivered , in a captivating way , a good introduction to the character and her background . Although it has some action flick elements , it is much more an intimate play , excellently written . Sadly , this is also , where a major drawback of the movie is revealed . An intimate play lives on the capabilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered . While Alexandra Staden did an excellent job as Modesty Blaise , her counterpart Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - as the villain Miklos - did not . Smiling his way through the plot as if it is an extend toothpaste commercial , he fails to build up an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the movie a masterpiece . The supporting cast is somehow similar , from some stereotyped gangsters and sluts to decent performances from Fred Pearson as Professor Lob and Eugenia Yuan as Irina .  
  This is just a short comment but I stumbled onto this movie by chance and I loved it . The acting is great , the story is simple and touching , and the lines , especially from the 4-yr-old Desi , are so cute and sad . Seek it out .  
  Dark Remains is a home run plain and simple . The film is full of creepy visuals , and scares ' that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat . The staircase scene in particular , these guys are good . Although they weren't working on a huge budget everything looks good , and the actors come through . Dark Remains does have one of those interpretive endings which may be a negative for some , but I guess it makes you think . Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are spot on as the grieving couple trying to rebuild there lives ' , however some side characters like the Sheriff didn't convince me . They aren't all that important anyways . I give Dark Remains a perfect ten rating for being ten times scarier than any recent studio ghost story / Japanese remake .  
  I thought this was a splendid showcase for Mandy 's bodacious bod . If you don't expect anything else , such as clever plot twists and believable character development , you won't be disappointed . Consider this a Sports Illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people , especially those who threaten to come between her and her ' Mommy ' ( Suzanna Arquette , who obviously doesn't want to play the sex kitten - she leaves that up to her daughter ) . Mandy 's face is a little too perfect , but her body is a complete 5-alarm fire , up there in the ranks of Sophia Loren when it comes to natural bustiness , a perfect 7-to-10 ratio of waist to hips , and splendidly configured legs , right down to her feet . ( There has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye ; Mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio ) . And no flat butt to boot , which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the ' nether hemispheres ' . Mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle-lit hot tub with her blindfolded German-Guy Victim No . 2 , but from all I could see from her bikini shots , she had the butt for it and didn't need a double to prove it . Mandy 's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic ' Mommy 's Girl ' , with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones . Her bisexual nature ( allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with German Guy No . 2 , who also happened to be her mother 's lover ) added an additional dimension to an otherwise one-dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses ( always by water with the men - the ultimate fate of the Latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason ) . Mandy 's Uber-Nordic facial features coupled with her Uber-Voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse . If Mandy really wants to further her career as an actress , I 'd advise her to immerse herself fully in the Romance Languages , especially Italian and Spanish - and maybe French , although I don't know if they would go for her type . But this would enable her to reconcile her Bo Derek face with her Vida Guerra body - but maybe her face is just a little too Nordic , and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by Michelle Johnson of the 1980 's whose early fame in Blame it on Rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground . Vambo Drule .  
  This documentary explores a story covered in Pilger 's latest book " Freedom Next Time " , which was published in 2006 . It reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of Diego Garcia , one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean . The islanders are technically British citizens , as Diego Garcia is a British colony , much like Mauritius , the nearby island to where the natives were exiled , used to be . But the British government has ignored their pleas to return to their homeland , as the island is now a military base for the United States army , who have used it as a basis for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan . As usual , Pilger 's coverage is shocking , especially as he documents the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders . His interviews all round are excellent , and his cornering of a Parliament representative where he uses the Government 's own information to pin him down , ranks as one of his best . Pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that fully illuminate the British conspiracy to evict the natives . The weaving of this footage with the interviews , and the islanders music , really heightens the film 's impact . It is not easy viewing , but " Stealing a Nation " is John Pilger at his best . Recommended .  
  I just saw the movie on tv . I really enjoyed it . I like a good mystery . and this one had me guessing up to the end . Sean Connery did a good job . I would recomend it to a friend .  
  Saw this a couple times on the Sundance Channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system . A semi-surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture ( or the lack of it ) , focusing on some seriously wacked , way beyond the Hollywood fringe dwellers . It had an amusing early performance from Mark Ruffalo , and some memorable cinematography from the DP who did the Polish Brothers movies . There was a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart . This film had cult classic written all over it , and I 'm surprised it 's not yet out on DVD . Hopefully soon .  
  You sit there for a half an hour and watch a story , believing it all , then watch another half an hour of the same story utterly unraveling .. and then put back together again . Brilliant . One of the most exciting feature films at the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary . I don't know if - other than Andrew Jarecki 's " Capturing the Friedmans " - there has ever been anything like Anna Broinowski 's " Forbidden Lie $ . " It features , exposes , defends , reveals , and questions everything about Norma Khouri , author of " Honor Lost , " the acclaimed and lambasted 2001 bestseller about honor killings in Jordan . What is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this " exposure " of Khouri is made with Khouri 's full participation . For the initial portion of the film , Khouri presents her story about the supposed honor killing of a friend of hers in Amman , the story of the book . She sounds completely believable , convincing . Then her story is taken apart , exposed , by eminently believable and convincing people , such as women 's rights activists in Jordan , investigative reporters there and in Australia , where Khouri lived for a while . Khouri comes back and denies the accusations , taking a successful lie-detector test in the process . There comes another segment of devastating exposures - not to be specified here because that would lessen the shock value .. and then Khouri comes back and faces the accusations ( not all , but the essential ones in the matter of the book ) . And the Houdini act continues , with round after round in this heavy-weight , seesaw prize fight , surprise after surprise - and there is no " happy ending " in the sense of resolution . Brilliant .  
  Without " mental anachronism " , this film which I would like to find in DVD offer an extraordinary diving in the vital and mental context of thought of the people before the " disenchantment of the world " . That , there is thirty years , a director and a scenario writer could test one such empathy and such a romantic truth to do it of them masterpiece leaves me astounding . It would be necessary to be able to see and re-examine it film for better seizing than the temporal and cultural distance us to make lose of capacity to be included / understood , analyze and finally to accept of such or such example of " primitive thought " . Because this thought maintaining almost impossible to feel in the secularized world however contain certain keys of our behavior , that only them future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance . If somebody knows where I then to get a numerical copy or VHS to me or DVD thank you in advance .  
  Prolific and highly influential filmmaker Martin Scorsese examines a selection of his favorite American films grouped according to three different types of directors : the director as an illusionist : D.W. Griffith or F . W . Murnau , who created new editing techniques among other changes that made the appearance of sound and color later step forward ; the director as a smuggler : filmmakers such as Douglas Sirk , Samuel Fuller , and mostly Vincente Minnelli , directors who used to disguise rebellious messages in their films ; and the director as iconoclast : those filmmakers attacking civil observations and social hang-ups like Orson Welles , Erich von Stroheim , Charles Chaplin , Nicholas Ray , Stanley Kubrick , and Arthur Penn . He shows us how the old studio system in Hollywood was , though oppressive , the way in which film directors found themselves progressing the medium because of how they were bound by political and financial limitations . During his clips from the movies he shows us , we not only discover films we 've never seen before that pique our interest but we also are made to see what he sees . He evaluate his stylistic sensibilities along with the directors of the sequences themselves . The idea of a film canon has been reputed as snobbish , hence some movie fans and critics favor to just make " lists . " However , canon merely denotes " the best " and supporters of film canon argue that it is a valuable activity to identify and experience a select compilation of the " best " films , a lot like a greatest hits tape , if just as a beginning direction for film students . All in all , one 's experience has shown that all writing about film , including reviews , function to construct a film canon . Some film canons can definitely be elitist , but others can be " populist . " As an example , the Internet Movie Database 's Top 250 Movies list includes many films included on several " elitist " film canons but also features recent Hollywood blockbusters at which many film " elitists " scoff , like The Dark Knight , which presently mingles in the top ten amidst the first two Godfather films , Schindler 's List and One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest , and the fluctuation of similar productions further down such as Iron Man , Sin City , Die Hard , The Terminator and Kill Bill : Vol . 2 . Writer Scorsese 's Taxi Driver Paul Schrader has straightforwardly referred to his canon as " elitist " and contends that this is positive . Scorsese is never particularly vocal at all about his social and political ideologies , but when we see this intense and admittedly obsessive history lesson on the birth and growth of American cinema in both ideological realms , we see that there is really no particular virtue in either elitism or populism . Elitism concentrates all attention , recognition and thus power on those deemed outstanding . That discrimination could easily lead to self-indulgence much in the vein of the condescending work of Jean-Luc Godard or the overrationalization of the production practices of a filmmaker like Michael Haneke . Yet populism invokes a belief of representative freedom as being only the assertion of the people 's will . As has been previously asserted about the all-encompassing misconceptions the people have about cinema , populism could be the end of the potential power and impact of cinema . One can only continue seeing films , because it is a vital social and metaphysical practice . And that 's what Martin Scorsese spends nearly four hours here trying to tell us , something which can't be told without being seen first-hand .  
  I remember seeing this years ago when it first came out and I was floored by Parker Posey 's performance . And the movie was pretty good also . For anyone who 's spent a little too much time in the nightclub / after-hours scene , this movie will have a special charm for you . Not too serious , mostly funny , and Parker Posey definitely blazes her talented way through this indie gem . I especially liked the Diaz character ( reminded me of every single struggling DJ I 've ever known ) . And many other movies could take a cue from this movie on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and bland about it . Babaganoosh !  
  This movie should be required viewing for all librarians or would-be librarians . All of the best lines are directly related to librarianship . The public library vs . academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students . It also breaks many librarian stereotypes . Librarians might even be capable of having fun - even if they don't * usually * have sex in the romance languages section ! ( The best movie about librarians ? Desk Set , with Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy , of course . )  
  " Shore Leave " is mostly an average Star Trek adventure . Nothing wrong with the episode , though . I simply think that this is not the best representation of what the show had to offer to fans . It is lightweight entertaining , nothing more . However , I 'm glad to see that a TV show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts . In this episode , Kirk decides to grant his crew some time off , and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation . As usual , the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be . There are some action and tense moments , but most of the story is played for laughs . Good , but unexceptional .  
  City Hall takes on the politics of a city rather than country , state or any sort of major political table . Granted it shines on New York City which is a huge political arena , especially nowadays , but it still goes for a smaller scale and puts the microscope on a few key players in a city wide scandal stumbled on by the mayor 's right hand . Director Harold Becker is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done Mercury Rising , Malice , and Domestic Disturbance and I think in many ways he incorporates so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault . I mean City Hall is meant to be a political drama , not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and potatoes of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand out .. what else .. or rather who else .. Al Pacino . The film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the mayoral office and the inner workings of the city . As the film continues it broadens its political spectrum to include a democratic boss , and his connections and then we are introduced to some of the goings on within the city . As events unfold a mystery begins and the political aspect is kind of left in the background but it still has a brilliant set up . I absolutely hate talking about Al Pacino . I mean even if ONCE he didn't give a good performance how could I ever say it ? The man is acting royalty . There is just something brilliant about his entire demeanor . In City Hall Pacino plays the New York City mayor . He has a sense of duty and honor and immediately appears to be a very upstanding politician . He also delivers one of the most powerful and outright engaging speeches I 've ever seen at the ' James Bone ' Funeral . I re-watched that speech four times and the first time I watched Pacino give it , my mouth gaped open and I almost wanted to stand up and applaud . Its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by Pacino . John Cusack , who I really do enjoy as an actor , turns in a mediocre and overdone performance as the deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun . He is kind of the focus of the film and him and Pacino have good chemistry together when they are on screen but there is just something in this performance .. he seems like he 's trying too hard . His accent is just bizarre , and although he is supposed to be cutthroat and intimidating he doesn't get seem to pull it off . Maybe he was having an off film . Bridget Fonda , on her way out of her high point stardom does an okay job as attorney for police widows Marybeth Cogan . Her performance is very similar to Cusack 's in that she just doesn't seem to find her groove with this character . Danny Aiello is terrific although his character is a little under explored as democratic boss with ties to the mafia Frank Anselmo . Martin Landau makes a decent cameo as Judge under scrutiny Walter Stern . The problem with City Hall is evident in my review of the characters and actors . Everyone is .. okay . There is a lot of back story that they try to bring out without actually showing it and it unfortunately leaves you just a little bit confused about the whole conspiracy . And of course you have Al Pacino in a rather small supporting role but he 's absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film . It almost feels like maybe they are intimidated by him being on screen with them . So City Hall could have been this huge political epic drama / thriller but it felt cut and toned down to an average run of the mill one BUT it still has to be seen for Pacino and a different spin on the inner working of politics . If you just won't see this movie than find Pacino 's speech at James Bone funeral because the word electrifying doesn't seem to give it justice but you can see what makes Al Pacino so incredible because in a mediocre film he pulls out this wallop of a speech and makes you feel it . If you 're a John Cusack fan which I am .. he 's definitely done better but he is the main character and all in all he does get his justice . A decent movie but unfortunately potential loss . 7.5/10  
  Being a transplanted New Yorker , I might be more critical than most in watching City Hall . But I have to say that before even getting to the story itself I was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of New York City that Director Harold Becker created . For example there 's a reference to Woerner 's Restaurant in Brooklyn where political boss Frank Anselmo likes to eat . There is or was a Woerner 's Restaurant on Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I lived in New York back in 1996 . It was in fact particularly favored by political people in the Borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts . No surprise because the script was co-authored by Nicholas Pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories . He knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film . A detective played by Nestor Serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss Anthony Franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead , including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school . The story mushrooms and at the end it 's reached inside City Hall itself . Al Pacino plays Mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his Deputy Mayor a transplanted Louisianan , a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself . He 's the outsider here and in trying to do damage control , Cusack finds more than he bargained for , Danny Aiello plays Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo and for those of you not from New York , his character is based on the late Borough President of Queens Donald Manes who was also brought down by scandal . He 's very much the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them , do Aiello in . City Hall was the farewell performance on film for Anthony Franciosa , one of the most underrated and under-appreciated talents ever on the screen . No one watches anyone else whenever he 's on . Al Pacino 's best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed , he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself . His is a complex part , he 's a decent enough man , but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like New York . For those who want to know about political life in the Big Apple , City Hall is highly recommended .  
  This film is a quite entertaining horror anthology film ( along the lines of Tales from the Crypt ) written by Robert Bloch ( author of Psycho ) . It 's good fun for horror fans and has an excellent cast . The movie should also be required viewing for Doctor Who fans since Jon Pertwee ( the third Doctor ) has an amusing role as a rude and obnoxious horror star !  
  For fans of 1970s Hammer type horror films , this movie should be a treat . The only thing I didn't like about the film was the fact that Peter Cushing was wasted on the worst episode . In general , however , this is a solid , spooky little movie . If this is not Amicus ' best film , it 's certainly one of them . The best episode , rightfully saved for last , is the one featuring Jon Pertwee as a horror film actor-it is really excellent . As good as Pertwee was in this role , it 's hard to believe he didn't do more of these types of movies . All in all , this is an entertaining movie , which scared the heck out of me as a child , and which still gives me the creeps to this day .  
  Although the beginning of the movie in New York takes too long , the movie is a must see for people who like this genre . When Hannah goes to Berlin to visit the older woman who helped her mother during the war , the movie gets much much better . The movie is a bit like The Pianist , can not really be compared .  
  For a " no budget " movie this thing rocks . I don't know if America 's gonna like it , but we were laughing all the way through . Some really Funny Funny stuff . Really non-Hollywood . The Actors and Music rocked . The cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up . Whoo Whoo ! I 've seen some of the actors before , but never in anything like this , one or two of them I think I 've seen in commercials or in something somewhere . Basically it Rocked ! Luckily I got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors .  
  I may very well be one of the few who really stuck to this film . I also saw this movie when it came out , and I agree with the last post that Up The Acedemy was way ahead of its ' time . The humor in the film itself is pure MAD magazine . I don't see why MAD stand behind this feature . It was also one of the few films of the early 80 's to have a killer accompanying soundtrack with the punk and new wave bands that were emerging from L.A. at the time . I own the soundtrack and I play it constantly to this day . What can I say ? There are definitely worst movies out there . I don't consider Porky 's to be as funny as Up The Academy , there are some really good laughs throughout the film , and the jokes fall on either stereotypes or getting laid . Hey , nobody said this was going to be The Maltese Falcon .  
  I saw the latter half of this movie about a year ago and was very happy to finally find it available on DVD . Recently , I watched several of the reality series on PBS about ranching , etc . None of them came as close to telling the story as this movie does . Based on REAL reality , pulling no punches , bleak , happy , tragic and enlightening , this is a movie that should be shown to students or to anyone interested in early frontier life . Fine acting on the part of both Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell add to an well done script . The opening credit states that it was done though funds supplied through the National Endowment for the Humanities . If this is the kind of product taxes could go to I would be happy to see more . I highly recommend it and would encourage people to tell a friend if you have seen it and enjoyed the film .  
  This western is done in a different manner than most others . Realism is the key here . Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on his ranch . How this is presented makes for a most interesting slice of Americana . I would have preferred to see this on the big screen rather than on tape , but it 's worth a look to see just how life was back in the real west . Cinematography is excellent . Solid 9 . Torn & Farrell excel in this movie .  
  This series got me into Deighton 's writing and the genre when I was younger and I love this presentation of the story . I would however disagree with the above comment . From what I have read in the past , it is not Holm 's performance that lead Deighton to refuse to have the series released but the butchering that all three books received in the translation to the screen . A great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended Samson 's field career . The scene is not in the book , the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany , not the Polish frontier . This whole storyline is cloth . The changes in Set similarly damage the integrity of the story . My perspective on Holm 's performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of Samson during his wife 's defection excellently and I believe comported himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide . Samson both pays for his father 's idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life . As Clevemore comments , had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department . I think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything . Holm is diminutive when compared to the Samson of the book - a physically impressive man capable of using his size to impose a presence .  
  Artimisia was on late last night . At first I didn't think I would like it , but seeing I didn't feel like sleeping yet and nothing else being on , I continued watching and felt myself intrigued by the young Artimisia , a virgin , pure and passionate . Her romance with the older Tassi envoked recognisable feelings . Even though the film is based on a very romantisised level and not reality , I loved it a lot more than the usual biographys or costume drama 's . Great play , great camerashots , great music and texts . I loved it and I want more of it ! : - )  
  Channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels , this show was certainly a naughty one . The presenter of this sometimes gross adult chat show , Four-time BAFTA winning and British Comedy Award winning ( also twice nominated ) Graham Norton was just the perfect gay host for a good show like this . It had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it . They basically had an adult idea which would either gross , humiliate or humour the guest , but some are not for the faint-hearted . They had women playing the recorder with their parts , men using their dicks to play a xylophone , women weeing upwards in the bath , men with or without pants under their kilts , and many more gross but hilarious ideas . This is just for adults , but enjoy it ! It won the BAFTA twice for Best Entertainment ( Programme or Series ) , it won the British Comedy Awards for Best Comedy Entertainment Programme ( also nominated ) , Best Comedy Talk Show , it won an Emmy for episode # 18 ( ? ) , and it won the National Television Awards twice for Most Popular Talk Show . It was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments . Very good !  
  " The Case of the Scorpion 's Tail " has all the elements that are necessary in order to make an effective giallo movie . The story is standard giallo . When a man dies in a plane crash his wife ( Ida Galli ) collects a $ 1 million life insurance policy . The widow heads to Greece for the payout but a series of gruesome murders follow her . There are plenty of suspects , including a tenacious investigator ( George Hilton ) from the insurance agency and the widow 's lover . Director Martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer . Anita Strindberg ( also memorable in " Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key " and " Who Saw Her Die ? " ) is a stunning-looking heroine . It 's one of Martino 's best films .  
  Say what you want about Andy Milligan - but if his family was even 10 % as deranged as the one in this film , well then I guess he could have turned out worse . Unfortunately , the video print of this film contains sex scene inserts originally shot by the distributor to boost the picture 's box office appeal . Several times during the film Milligan 's ugly camerawork and silent film music abruptly ends , and suddenly good-looking stand-ins for Milligan 's homely actors take over and start doing it to psychedelic 60 's guitar rock . It 's pretty easy to fast-forward through if you 're trying to pay attention to Milligan 's original film , which , unfortunately , is missing quite a bit of action that was cut to make room for the added sex scenes . What remains , however , is still compelling stuff . I don't think I 've ever seen a more hateful mother in any film before .  
  This movie is an exact copy of a TV series on Indian television channel doordarshan Which was aired at least 15 years ago . The series was known as " gubbarre " meaning balloons . Each episode was a new short story . The story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and " convincing " Abhay Doel does a good job but he doesn't fit the role of a " normal " and " third class " guys ( as he calls himself in the movie ) . In fact Shayan Munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have fitted the Abhays role but Shayan just doesn't have the talent to pull it off . I would suggest watching the series if it is available . It is the same story except for the running around with the friends mother and the initial introduction . The acting of the TV actors was much better than these " stars " . The only reason this movies is a flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour ( or 45 minutes ) story to 2 + hours . So it has to get draggy . Even the nasal singing sensations songs could not make up . This movies is good for a lazy Sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you haven't watched the original TV serial . The script and the ending of the serial was much better # SPOILERS AHEAD # # SPOILERS AHEAD # # SPOILERS AHEAD # # SPOILERS AHEAD # # SPOILERS AHEAD # THe ending of the original serial was much stronger as the hero himself dumps the girl even thought she is willing to marry him . HE is aware and tell her that he doesn't want to be " repayed " and never helped with that intention . The director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film . The original ending would have bought tears to the girls eyes and would have had the guys nodding in agreement . The deliver just wasn't right . But personally I feel this is a pathetic copy . No credit should be given to the director / scriptwriter . The story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers int he class of PRemchand munshi . I am not sure if this is premchand munshi 's story but many of the other short stories int he series feature a few of premchand munshi 's and other great Hindi writers stories .  
  Steve Carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy , first on ' The Daily Show ' , and then in various supporting roles . In Virgin , Carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths . Carell plays Andy Stitzer , a middle aged man living a quiet , lonely life . Andy is a little odd , but in an awkward nice guy sort of way . One night , while socializing with his co-workers for the first time , Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin . His co-workers , David ( Paul Rudd ) , Jay ( Romany Malco ) , and Cal ( Seth Rogen ) initially tease Andy about his situation . But it 's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that Andy is , and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity . And so begins Andy 's quest into adulthood . Andy is the quintessential innocent , and the bulk of the humor derives from his naiveté to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film . Some of the humor is crude gross out stuff , but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy . In addition , I found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as Andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life . I 'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama ; it 's a rolling in your seats comedy . Still , every good comedy I have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters . A good comparison would be ' The Wedding Crashers ' from earlier this summer . Virgin has a similar humor , but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes . I particularly loved the ending of the film , which I thought was a perfect way to end the flick . Without giving anything away , it reminded me of ' Something About Mary ' . Very light and fun ; it leaves you laughing and smiling , which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy . I would highly recommend .  
  All Dogs Go To Heaven Is The Most Cutest Animated Film To Have Dogs In 1989 . The Previous Don Bluth Film The Land Before Time ( 1988 ) Became A Success . Dogs Are So Cute As Little Mice . Aw , I Just Want To Hug Them When They 're Cute . Where Was I ? Oh , Yes . Its Animation Is Beautiful , The Characters Are Great When They 're Perfectly Voiced And The Songs Are Cute And Touching . It Opened In November 17 1989 The Same Date As The Little Mermaid Produced By Walt Disney Feature Animation . The Part Where Charlie Got Killed By Carface Was So Unforgivable . Carface Is So Mean Because He Wanted To Kill Charlie . Shame On Him ! The Love Survive Song Performed By Irene Cara And Freddie Jackson Was So Beautiful . All Dogs Go To Heaven Is The Best Animated Movie Ever .  
  An unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time , this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon . I remember this very well from my childhood , it was funny and sad and very beautiful . Well it starts out a bit dark , a dog who escaped the pound , and gets killed by an old friend , ends up in Heaven , and comes back . But it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals . Some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons , like the dream sequence of Charlie , but everything else was okay , and the songs were fair . A memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise , I just love that guy , ahehehe . And Judith Barsi of Jaws The Revenge , may God rest her soul , poor girl , she didn't deserve to die , but she is in Heaven now , all good people go to Heaven . Overall this is a very good animated movie , a Don Bluth classic enough to put anime and Disney to shame . Recommended for the whole family . And know this , if you have the original video of this , you 'll find after the movie , Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message , gotta love that guy , ahehehe .  
  I finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of " Show People " . I cannot comment any more than what previous viewers have stated and to the characters , plot and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words . Seeing the cameo , out-of-character appearances of so many M-G-M silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself . I really like the scene where Marion Davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie , Patricia Pepoire . Make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she sees Marion Davies but it is something to the effect of " I don't think I like her ! " Pop the corn , pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history . Enjoy !  
  Marion Davies stars in this remarkable comedy " Show People " released by MGM in 1928 . Davies plays a hick from Savannah , Georgia , who arrives in Hollywood with her father ( Dell Henderson ) . The jalopy they arrive in is a hoot - as is Davies outrageous southern costume . Davies lands a job in slapstick comedy , not what she wants , but it brings her success . She meets fellow slapstick star William Haines , who is immediately smitten with her . Well , Davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio ( " High Art Studios " ) and lands a job in stuffy period pieces . A handsome but fake actor ( Andre Telefair ) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious Hollywood star . Davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life , but of course learns that is not who she really is . Marion Davies is wonderful throughout , as she - outrageously - runs the gamut of emotions required of a " serious " actress . William Haines is his usual wonderful comedic self , and there are cameos by Charles Chaplin , John Gilbert , and other famous stars of the day , including the director of the film , King Vidor . This is a silent film with a few " sound effects " as sound pictures were just coming into their own . A treasure of a film .  
  Let me say first that this show was top tier when John Ritter was there . Upon his death , the show did drop off a bit , but the producers didn't give up on the show , adding James Garner and David Spade to the regular cast from 2003 to 2005 . The show centers around the Hennessy family , Paul ( John Ritter , may he rest in peace ) , his wife Cate ( Katey Sagal ) , their daughters Bridget ( Kaley Cuoco ) , Kerry ( Amy Davidson ) , and their son , Rory ( Martin Spanjers ) . When Ritter was on the show , I would shriek in laughter ( and proud to admit it , I am ) , but now that he 's gone , I 'll only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh . I 'm very glad that I fell for this show 's trance after Ritter 's untimely death , because it made the eps with Ritter so much better . Ritter 's character is just so well acted and well rounded , that you can't help but love him . He is always bossing the girls around about dating , but he really wants them to be happy . It 's the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment . Katey Sagal is great as well , and she too is a likable character . After Ritter 's death , her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids , but I believe Sagal has shaped the lives of Cuoco , Davidson , and Spanjers , because she and Ritter had been friends for a long time . The funniest person on the show would have to be Bridget Hennessy , played by Kaley Cuoco . She is the ultimate blonde : gorgeous , slow , dim-witted , yet she is a smart person . She is off the wall hilarious with her innocent ' blonde ' humor and how conceited she is . Amy Davidson can get a tad annoying as Kerry , but that 's the purpose of her character . The only fault of the show is that the show never really gives Kerry anything to be happy about . She 's always after Bridget , and her character feels like it 's just thrown in there . Martin Spanjers as the lone Hennessy son is hysterical , and when Ritter is on the show , he 's mostly comic material . Upon the death of Ritter , the show does provide some story lines for Rory . David Spade and James Garner are all nothing but laughs , with the occasional side story for C.J. , Spade 's character . Garner plays Cate 's father , as a bit of background information . All in all , I give this show a great review because it is a great show that had a tragic event happen that crippled it . You 'll enjoy it . 9/10 - spy  
  Im not usually a lover of musicals , but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be Oliver . This film is so well made , the characters are well depicted , the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great , my favourite being ' Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of Fagin . I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were , so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs , usually it was ' Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film . Its a timeless musical you definitely couldn't remake it , it stands on its own . Its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked so well if it had been . I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed , as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London , the orphanages , the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive , and the film portrays this very well . Also another great reason to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier , notice his long thin legs , this was bred out of the breed many years ago , they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him , and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times . Notice he has scars { which is probably makeup } on his face , Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit . A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit . His a beautiful dog any way , and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy , he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was . This is a great musical to watch if you like musicals , and if you don't like musicals give it a try any way , there 's something for everyone in this film .  
  I admit not being that fond of Oliver ! as a young child-it 's long , and the story is a little slow-moving because of all the musical numbers . As a teenager I discovered that the fun of this movie is the experience itself . Rather than thinking of it as an adaptation of Oliver Twist , think of it as a celebration of the classic story . The adaptation is loose at best , but really , if you 're watching a musical , you ain't there for the story . The music is the core of this movie , and an overwhelming majority of it is stellar and very catchy . Most or all of the cast was involved in the stage version of the musical , and it shows in their performances-and I consider this a plus . The performances are all in a more " stagey " style of acting typical of much older films , and they are very entertaining . The exception is the kid playing Oliver , whose job seemed to be to look cute and stay out of the real performers ' way . Fagin and the Dodger are the real stars of this movie . Oliver Reed also does a fantastic job maintaining an intimidating screen presence as the menacing Bill Sykes . Even Sykes ' dog Bullseye puts on a good performance . This movie isn't for everyone . People who hate musicals will despise it , as will those who take musicals too seriously . Nitpicking over faulty historical details or mistaking exaggerated stage-type acting for bad acting will ruin anyone 's enjoyment . Just sit back and enjoy the entertainment-it 's much better if you remember that , as a musical , it 's a fantasy loosely organized around the book , not a strict adaptation .  
  Spoilers .. I saw the original on TV sometime ago and remembered this production as less gripping than most Beeb costume drama . I rewatched on DVD this week and still have the same impression of it . It 's a good story at first , but weakens when the heroine becomes oh so terribly brave and noble and returns to her utterly vile husband when he 's ill and I got so totally irritated with her saintliness . I suppose this was the " right thing to do " when the story was written as well as contributing plenty of angst , and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband as marriage made her no more than his possession , let alone to carry on scandalously with a lover as I expect a lot of the modern audience would have liked to see . But it 's hard to take the santimoniousness nowadays and especially when this heroine had a strong , brave admirer ready to defend her against anyone and everyone . So re the story as in the film I 'm equivocal . It 's well done as per the novel , but somewhat irritating as per today 's kind of life . Steadfast hero Gilbert was certainly a saint to put up with his ladylove 's variable and often cryptic behaviour and persistent self-denial and to be so consistently supportive . So I felt it a great shame that when Helen was at long last free to be with him , the script didn't allow him a bit more than about one minute to fall on each other for a quick hug before the titles came up . This was completely ridiculous when we 'd been waiting all this time through all that dripping sentiment over the undeserving husband for a decent bit of dialogue and a good embrace between hero and heroine . Instead , the ending was as though the film makers had run out of time or finance or just couldn't be bothered . " Here you are - one minute , do what you can in that , then cut as the director wants to go home now .. " I was left feeling totally dissasatisfied . However , very high commendations to the acting of Toby Stephens a perfect and very handsome hero , and Rupert Graves a superbly nasty and self-pitying villain . Tara Fitzgerald was satisfactory within the confines of the script that forced her to be a depressing and rather sanctimonious victim so much of the time . That said , I love these classic dramas and virtually all of them are a sight better than much of the " modern " drama on TV these days . So 7 stars because in spite of the irritations it 's still a good watch .  
  Actually , the answer only occupies a tiny portion of this excellent Imax movie that educates us on our delicate selves . C.G. and special cameras-assisted by Imax-incredibly display the inner ( and outer ) workings of an average human , be it adult men and women , boys and girls , or babies . Nearly every human body part aspect is specifically detailed : digestion , reproduction ( featuring a Marvin Gaye hit ) , the heart , etc . Some especially revealing moments include how an infant can be immersed underwater and also how the brain 's impulses look . It is amazing how we function . The subject matter skips around an awful lot . But at all times we still learn a hell of a lot about our bodies that we should be * required * to know .  
  Well i am going to go against the grain on this film so it seems . Being a self confessed horror fan I sat down to this not quite knowing what to expect . After 2 or 3 mins i actually found myself scared ( quite rare ) . The film obviously has a small budget and is set around charing cross station but the films lack of money does not distract from the story . Yes the story is a bit far fetched and doesn't explain itself very well but THE CREEP is a class act and proceeds to slash and dismember anything that comes its way . MESSAGE FOR LADIES ! THERE ARE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE FILM YOU SHOULD CLOSE YOUR EYES AT OR AT LEAST CROSS YOUR LEGS ! you will understand when you see it . All in all a good film and it makes a change to see a good slasher movie that actually scares  
  " Creep " is a new horror film that , without a doubt , will please many genre fans simply because it 's so down to the point and unscrupulous ! It has many genuine shock-moments , a whole lot of repulsive gore-sequences and a rare claustrophobic tension . What it hasn't got is logic and a solid plot but , to tell you the truth , that didn't bother me for one second . When the end-credits start to roll , there are still many unanswered questions to ponder on but director / writer Christopher Smith ( in his debut ) seemly preferred to fully focus on tension and adrenalin-rushing action instead of long , soporific speeches and theories that could explain the existence of the " creep " in the London subway . The story revolves on the young and haughty Kate , who leaves her own party in order to go and meet the famous actor George Clooney who 's in town to present his new film . She falls asleep in the subway , misses the last train and she finds herself trapped in the underground subway network . Things really get terrifying when she encounters a mad-raving lunatic who lives in the old tunnels and kills / kidnaps people to experiment upon . Even experienced homeless people , security guards or sewer-workers can't rescue her from this ravenous monster ! I really dug the creep-character ! He 's nauseating , hideous and primitive but in a strange way fascinating . Christopher Smith only leaves us clues and hints , and it 's merely up to the viewer to guess this vile creature 's origin and background . I reckon this isn't very original , and I 'm sure many people won't appreciate the lack of content , but I forgive Smith and I think it 's better this way than going over the top completely , " Jeepers Creepers " - style ( that particular film started out great as well , but as soon as the Creeper 's identity was clear it turned into a very mediocre horror effort ) . The obvious aspect-to-love is the outrageous gore ! There 's some severe butchering going on in this film and the make-up , as well as the sound effects , are very convincing . The ominous setting of the abandoned London subway during night is effectively used . There also is some acting-talent present in this film , with Franka Potenta ( Run Lola Run ) returning to graphic horror nearly five years after the cool German film " Anatomie " . Creep is terrific entertainment when you 're in an undemanding mood and Christopher Smith definitely is a director I 'll keep an eye on . Make sure you don't have to take the subway right after watching this film ..  
  I just saw this film last night at Toronto Film Festival where it was playing under the Midnight Madness section . To tell you the truth , the only reason why I went for this movie was because it shared its name with the Radiohead song , and also because my friend had bought the tickets so I really didn't have a choice : -D I went in expecting it to be something like The Silence of the Lambs , but it turned out to be semi-gore flick . Somebody has already mentioned that none of the characters are likable , and that is absolutely correct . I really couldn't care less if Potente 's character got her entrails ripped out by the Creep . I was rooting for the homeless to make it out alive with Potente 's character getting her just desserts . Christopher Smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film . However , the story is rather weak , but then again the whole point of the movie was to scare the crap out of you and it did that quite effectively . The score by a Bristol band called The Insects was top notch . That , more than anything else , really scared the crap out of me . The director was a really decent chap and was quite entertaining during the Q & A session . I really do hope he gets to make better films in the future . This one is strictly for genre fans , but I 'd recommend non-fans to give this a try anyway . It was a fun ride .  
  This is according to me a quite bizarre movie with a lot of humor in it . I wouldn't say that it is very scary , but more fun I guess . That is if you like horror movies . Scarecrow kind of remembered me of " Children of the corn " , but still not . If you compare these two movies this is much more fun to watch = )  
  I recently bought this movie with a bunch of other LaserDiscs from eBay . Usually , I am into war and action movies but occasionally I enjoy romantic comedies . If you are bored by today 's special FX films and high gloss romantic comedies you should check out Shop Around the Corner on a quiet evening . What I like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency . There is nothing fake or pretentious about them . Take Mr . Matuschek for example : When he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself . Not just because of the humiliation but because he has been unjust to the character of Stewart . ( OK , weired example . ) Yes , the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable . Yet still , I liked it a lot . If you likes Notting Hill then you will like Shop around the corner . in fact , Hugh Grant reminds me a lot of Jimmy Stewart .  
  So much has been written about the film 's plot , the wonderful acting performance , the script , the melancholy , bittersweet atmosphere , the superb direction - what can I add ? Just watch for one of the most heart warming , beautifully acted , poignant scenes ever filmed . It is Christmas eve and Frank Morgan 's character ( the owner of the shop - Mr . Matuschek ) is recovering from his broken marriage and a suicide attempt . As each of his employees leave he invites them to a Christmas dinner . Each and everyone of them politely turn him down . They all have plans for their own Christmas eve . At this stage there is a deep sadness to this moving scene . Frank Morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears . Thankfully we have a happy denouement to this very special scene . The new employee , the errand boy , is the last to exit the shop into a beautiful snowy street scene . Desperately Mr . Matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would love to spend the evening with him , he will treat him to all the wonderful Christmas food that this errand boy has probably never seen ! The chap is overwhelmed , he too is obviously as lonely as Mr . Matuschek and together they can have a wonderful Christmas meal . Every time I see this scene it moves me . If you manage to get the delightful DVD look at the great trailer with Frank Morgan introducing himself as Mr . Matuschek and an appearance by the director of the film - the talented Ernst Lubitsch . This film is a joy from beginning to end .  
  Two warring shop workers in a leather-goods store turn out to be secret sweethearts as they correspond under box-number aliases . Within this simple idea and an everyday setting , Lubitsch produces a rich tapestry of wit , drama , poignancy and irony that never lets up . Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotions and tensions , and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own sub-plots and in-jokes . Although wrongly eclipsed by Stewart 's big films of 39/40 ( Destry , Philadelphia Story , Mr Smith ) this is easily on a par and we enjoy a whole range of acting subtlties unseen in the other films .  
  Every time I watch this movie I am more impressed by the whole production . I have come to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy ever made . Everyone involved is perfect ; script , acting , direction , sets and editing . Whilst James Stewart can always be relied upon for a good performance , and the supporting cast are magnificent , it is Margaret Sullavan who reveals what an underrated actress she was . Her tragic personal life give poignancy to her qualities as a performer where comedy acting skills are not easy to achieve . Lubitsch managed to get the best and he obviously gave his best . Watch for the number of scenes which were done on one take - breathtaking .  
  How many of us wish that we could throw away social and cultural obligations and be free ? Most of us , I suspect . Shall we dance ? is not a movie about dancing . It is about learning about ourselves , recognising what we are looking for in life and having the courage to go in search of it . Mr Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dancing is viewed as unsuitable behaviour . One day Mr Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing acadamy . he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons . He is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule . He hides the fact that he is attending dancing classes from his colleagues and family . There is a hilarious scene in the mensroom at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe , a workmate who also dances , are interrupted practising some dance steps . There are many other funny and warm-hearted scenes . The ending is not a fairytale , but it leaves the viewer feeling good . This movie helped me to understand the Japanese people a little better . It is a warm and very worthwhile film to see .  
  Artisticly shot , actors portray exactly their role . You get a real feeling watching Lucienne ascend from poverty to the most beautiful girl around . A sense of tragedy to triumph to tragedy again . All in all I have seen this film at least 10 times . And can VERY well say that Prix De Beute ' ( the Beauty Prize , Miss Europe ) is a MAJOR favorite in my silent film collection . The expressiveness of Louise Brooks is perfect and I recommend this film to ANYONE who appreciates artistic beauty coupled with a tragic story line .  
  I loved it ! Fred MacMurray is wonderful as Skid Johnson , a somewhat conceited , proud yet at the same time very vulnerable saxophone player who is in love with Maggie ( Carole Lombard ) , who 's always there for him . They meet in Panama after Maggie comes off a ship and end up in a bar with Anthony Quinn . Tony gets punched in the nose after her insults Maggie by thinking her a loose woman - all because she took off her hat in public . Big brawl and Maggie ends up stuck in Panama . Romance . Carole and Arthur are great together . Maggie is always there for him whenever he needs her . She urges him to go to NY where ( well watch the movie and find out ) . They have these wonderful scenes together where she sings in his arms while he plays the saxophone . I definitely recommend it .  
  I remember originally seeing this film at Radio City Music Hall when it came out . I didn't really understand the humor back then , but this movie can make me laugh out loud . With all due respect to George Burns ( RIP ) , Walter Matthau really deserved the Oscar for this film . His performance is amazing-given the fact that he was 20 years younger than his character , Willie Clark . His mannerisms are first-rate . ( " You know what kind of songs he wrote ? Sh * t ! " and when speaking to the Spanish-speaking guy at the front desk : " No ! No ! No enchilada ! " ) Absolutely hilarious ! Kudos to Richard Benjamin , who played straight man to Matthau . I just wish this was on DVD , because my VHS recording is getting a bit old . I had no interest in seeing the remake with Woody Allen , because in no way can it match the original .  
  Loved the film ! This was my first glimpse at both Reese Witherspoon and Jason London , both of which are two of my favorites . Must say that no matter how many times I 've seen this movie I can't help but tear up . One of those movies that should become a classic for all .  
  This is a very enjoyable film with excellent actors and actresses evoking a range of emotions . It contains some really excellent humour which the whole family can enjoy . You get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs . And , it ends very upbeat  
  i honestly think that that was the best version of war of the worlds i 've every seen . it was funny but it was also educational i learned whole lot the movie and if i could i would by that movie . my favorite part was when the soldiers killed on robot and another one came right from behind it . in the last movie war of the world i think that it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better . but any way i give this movie 2 thumbs up . and if they where to make another movie like this i will definitely watch it . thank you  
  I really enjoyed this movie . It took a pretty dark story-that of Shakespeare 's Macbeth - and wrapped it in a quirky , often funny and poignant modern yarn . Kudos to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of modern NYC and Macbeth 's Scotland together under one roof . The opposing worlds act to really bring out the intrigue and comedy of the play and you have to love Harold Perrineau as the Chorus , a part which doesn't exist in the play but really helps to jazz things up . The ending stands out among little indies I 've seen for it 's closure and originality .  
  Wow , I can't believe i 'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie . Although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is Matt lillard , granted most people probably either think he 's too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we 're both the same age and from the same generation and i 've watched this guy so many times that he 's one of my favorites now . This is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in SLC Punk , another great Lillard film . Baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything , which start to amount to craziness . Also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent D'onofrio , a very under appreciated person in the film industry . The woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene = ) It 's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one . They all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it 's a timebomb waiting to explode . Matt shows his true prowess as the scheming JAck who initially starts the whole scheme . Vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business . Vince 's character is a bit deranged and skitz 's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film . The surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy , well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like . This movie kept me very interested besides the fact Matt was in it , it 's a great movie and i 'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies . Critic 's probably won't like this movie , but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway .  
  I caught this movie on IFC and I enjoyed it , although I felt like the editing job was a little rough , though it may have been deliberate . I had a little bit of a hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for a little bit of a Pulp Fiction-style non-linear plot presentation . It seemed a little forced , though . I certainly think that the movie is worth watching , but I think it could have used a little cleaning up . Some scenes just don't seem to make sense after others . I 'm surprised to see the rating here as low as it is . It 's not outstanding , but it doesn't have any really serious problems . I gave it a 7/10 . The movie did show at least that Laurence Fishburne can act when he wants to . They must have just told him not to in the Matrix movies .  
  " GEORGE LOPEZ , " in my opinion , is an absolute ABC classic ! I haven't seen every episode , but I still enjoy it . There are many episodes that I enjoyed . One of them was where Amy ( Sandra Bullock ) walked into a moving piece of machinery . If you want to know why , you 'll have to have seen it for yourself . Before I wrap this up , I 'd like to say that everyone always gave a good performance , the production design was spectacular , the costumes were well-designed , and the writing was always very strong . In conclusion , even though new episodes can currently be seen , I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good .  
  Many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of super star starring in this movie ( Gackt , Hyde , and Wang Lee Hom is very famous singer in Japan ) . But don't judge it before you watch , is what I say . Gackt and staff are very serious when made this film , and they worked so hard . It 's a good film with a touchy story inside . Several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad . They made it so good until I can't stop watching this all over again . The story has written pretty well but I admit that their act are little disappointing . This is especially for Hyde because his skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with other language except his native language ( Japan ) . But , it 's comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the movie . I think Gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their life . When Toshi was killed , when Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che to being vampire like him because he won't let her die , When Sho 's Brother died , Kei Shoot Son die , and the best and beautiful scene is When Sho pass away ~ even I told that Hyde 's skill is still weird but I give him two thumps up at that scene ! There 's a time where The plot goes too fast like they didn't tell the reason Why Son can join the local mafia and being Sho 's enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also Son is Sho 's brother in law . Whatever , I love this movie ~ ( very much ^ ^ ) . This is an action movie with a touching beautiful story .  
  Having borrowed this movie from the local library a couple of weeks ago intending to originally see this on or a few days after Memorial Day , I finally got to seeing Sayonara just this morning . In this one Marlon Brando plays Major Lloyd " Ace " Gruver , a General 's son who 's been raised a certain way , being transfered from Korea to Japan where his girlfriend Eileen Webster ( Patricia Owens ) conveniently happens to be . Before leaving , he tries to persuade one of his men , a Joe Kelly ( Red Buttons ) , out of marrying Japanese woman Katsumi ( Miyoshi Umeki ) since that 's a violation of military fraternization laws . With the romance of him and Eileen on the outs , however , Ace not only becomes the best man at Joe and Katsumi 's wedding , he falls for an Asian himself after he and Captain Mike Bailey ( James Garner ) go out on the town and watch headlining entertainer Hana-ogi ( Miiko Taka ) on stage . Bailey himself is dating one of the dancers , Fumiko-San ( Reiko Kuba ) . Eileen herself seems to have a fancy for one of the Kabuki performers , Nakamura ( Ricardo Montalban ) . I 'll stop right there and say that this was a mostly compelling drama about the prejudices concerning American-Asian relations of romance that was very touching from beginning to end . Even seeing Hispanic Montalban playing an Oriental isn't too embarrassing ( though it 's a good thing his part is short ) . And there 's some nice touches of humor like that of Brando 's head hitting the top of Button 's and Umeki 's inside doorway more than once . Red and Miyoshi themselves deserve their Oscars especially Red with his defiant and proud emotions throughout . Rookie Garner , before being cast in his legendary role on TV 's " Marverick " , is fine in his scenes with Brando and Miiko Taka shows great restraint in her initial characterization as an anti-American . While I 've read there were some changes from James Michener 's novel , I can't imagine director Josha Logan , who had previously adopted another Michener work into the Broadway musical " South Pacific " and would eventually make that into a movie as well , not staying true to the original source . He certainly provided some inspiration with the ending scenes that made the heartbreaking earlier tragedy in the film a somewhat necessary plot twist . Some of the production numbers may have made the movie a little longish but otherwise , Sayonara was wonderful educational experience about the ' 50s mores that permeated America and Japan at the time .  
  Well , this is probably one of the best movies I 've seen and I love it so much that I 've memorized most of the script ( especially the scene in the storage unit when Jerry Lee breaks wind ) and even with the script in my head I still like to watch it for Jerry Lee , that German Shepherd is hysterical and really is put to the test to see who 's smarter . The tag line holds true as well . Not to mention the acting is great , though Christine Tucci sounds different in a whisper ( Check filmography under CSI if you don't know what I mean ) . It 's too bad that this movie only contained the single issue Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work with , it would have been pretty cool to see the tricks that Zeus and Welles had up their sleeve .  
  The film starts out very slowly , with the lifestyle of Wallace Napalm , an attendant at a photo-service drop-off station . His wife has been restricted to her home with an ankle bracelet as the result of a sentence for arson . Wallace is a member of the volunteer fire department , and takes firefighting seriously . As we watch Wallace 's rather dull life proceeding , suddenly there comes something new and jarring : a traveling carnival comes to town . One of its stars is Wilder Napalm , Wallace 's brother . He 's a clown , but he has a special talent . So does Wallace . They 're both pyrokineticists or " pyrotics , " people capable of starting fires through mental energy . Wallace keeps his powers secret ; Wilder lets his acquaintances know what he can do . Spoiler : Some of their differences go back to a childhood incident where they inadvertently caused the death of a vagrant . Wallace holds back from using his powers ; Wilder wants to go public on national TV . Complicating the matter , Wilder wants Wallace 's wife , whom they both dated years earlier . She becomes a bone of contention , and becomes one of the reason that the brothers finally have a literal firefight . The film is entertaining , but not laugh-out-loud funny . I think enough of it to have a copy in my library . It 's a good offbeat film .  
  This movie probably would only get a 7 or 8 from me to tell the truth if I had seen trailers or had any kind of knowledge of what the film is all about . Since it was virtually all a surprise it was almost a perfect piece of edgy entertainment that gets a strong 9 from me . I read through some of the comments briefly and saw that someone else had almost the same experience as me and he advised to just watch it . It was good advice . Read the rest at your own risk of spoiling . Eva Mendez plays a head-strong , success-starved network TV programmer that took a joke made by a co-worker while brain-storming TV program ideas about Russian Roulette seriously . The story follows her in a documentary style on her pursuit to make this happen .  
  I have to be honest , i was expecting a failure so bad , because it really did sound like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money . But that wasn't the case with this pretty funny ( sometimes odd ) movie . I loved how they told the story of Timon and Pumba , the story with Simba and him having trouble sleeping was funny . The jacuzzi bubble , and when Pumba leaves , the bubbles stop . It 's all harmless fun , good for kids and some adults . I think this movie will last for a while because it is rather good for a straight to Video and DVD movie . While the movie does seem a little odd and kind of trails off toward the end , it works . 8 out of 10  
  This story was never among my favourites in Christie 's works so I was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation . The mouse motif was effective if a little overdone , the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the ' crime in the past ' subplot . The students were all pretty much as I imagined them although its a pity they weren't a more cosmopolitan bunch - perhaps the revised thirties setting didn't allow for that ! I thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming ; perhaps its because I 've not long re-read the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early on . Humour was much more prevalent in these early Poirots . Sometimes it works but I found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode ( though I did smile at the ' Lemon sole ' throwaway line ) . Altogether though , a solid entry in the series though not one of the best .  
  Police , investigations , murder , suspicion : we are all so acquainted with them in movies galore . Most of the films nowadays deal with crime which is believed to involve viewers , to provide them with a thrilling atmosphere . However , most of thrill lovers will rather concentrate on latest movies of that sort forgetting about older ones . Yet , it occurs that these people may easily be misled . A film entirely based on suspicion may be very interesting now despite being more than 20 years old .. it is GARDE A VUE , a unique movie by Claude Miller . Is there much of the action ? Not really since the events presented in the movie take place in a considerably short time . But the way they are executed is the movie 's great plus . Jerome Charles Martinaud ( Michel Serrault ) is being investigated by Inspector Gallien ( Lino Ventura ) and Insector Belmont ( Guy Marchand ) . It 's a New Year 's Eve , a rainy evening and not very accurate for such a meeting . Yet , after the rape and murder of two children , at the dawn of the old year , the door of suspicion must be open at last . In other words , ( more quoted from the movie ) , it must be revealed who an evil wolf really is . To achieve this , one needs lots of effort and also lots of emotions from both parties .. Some people criticize the script for being too wordy . Yet , I would ask them : what should an investigation be like if not many questions and , practically , much talk . This wordiness touches the very roots of the genre . In no way is this boring but throughout the entire film , it makes you , as a viewer , as an observer , involved . Moreover , the film contains well made flashbacks as the stories are being told . Not too much and not too little of them - just enough to make the whole story clearer and more interesting . The most memorable flashbacks , for me , are when Chantal ( Romy Schneider ) , Martinaud 's wife , talks about one lovely Christmas .. But these flashbacks also contain the views of the places , including the infamous beach . It all wonderfully helped me keep the right pace . And since I saw GARDE A VUE , I always mention this film as one of the " defenders " of French cinema against accusations of mess and chaos . But those already mentioned aspects may not necessarily appeal to many viewers since they might not like such movies and still won't find the content and its execution satisfactory . Yet , GARDE A VUE is worth seeing also for such people . Why ? For the sake of performances . But here don't expect me to praise foremost Romy Schneider . GARDE A VUE is not Romy Schneider vehicle . She does a terrific job as a mother who is deeply in despair for a lost child . She credibly portrays a person who is calm , concrete , who does not refuse an offered cup of tea but who does not want to play with words . Her part which includes a profound talk of life and duty is brilliant , more credible than the overly melancholic role of Elsa in LA PASSANTE DE SANS SOUCI . It is still acted . However , Romy Schneider does not have much time on screen . Practically , she appears for the first time after 45 minutes from the credits ; she , as a wife and a different viewpoint , comes symbolically with the New Year , at midnight . Her role is a purely supporting one . Who really rocks is Lino Ventura . He IS the middle aged Inspector Antoine Gallien who wants to find out the truth , who is aware that his questions are " missiles " towards the other interlocutor but does not hesitate . He is an inspector who , having been married three times , is perfectly acknowledged of women 's psyche . He is the one who does not regard his job as a game to play but a real service . Finally , he is a person who does not find it abnormal to sit there on New Year 's Eve . Michel Serrault also does a fine job expressing fear , particularly in the final scenes of the movie . But thumbs up for Mr Ventura . Brilliant ! As far as memorable moments are concerned , this is not the sort of film in which this aspect is easily analyzed . The entire film is memorable , has to be seen more than once and has to be felt with its atmosphere and , which I have not mentioned before , gorgeous music . For me , the talk of Chantal and Inspector Gallien is the most brilliant flawless moment . You are there with the two characters , you experience their states of mind if you go deeper into what you see . GARDE A VUE is a very interesting film , a must see for thrill lovers and connoisseurs of artistic performances . New Year has turned and .. is it now easier to open the door ? You 'll find out when you decide to see the memorably directed movie by Claude Miller . 8/10  
  This is a script that Ed Wood worked over 10 years on trying to get made . Aris Iliopulos finally got the chutzpah to film a script that Wood saved from his burning home at the expense of other , more transitory valuables . This is a dialogue-free movie , that some may foolishly describe as silent . In fact , it is a quite noisy film , without the inane chatter of most flicks . In the hands of these filmmakers , the music and sound effects provide a rich audio experience that works better than almost any grist from the Hollywood script mill , particularly that stupid boat movie Billy Zane last was in ( ' Watch out ! ' , ' Oh no ! ' - J . Cameron .. ick .. ) I 'll take Zane 's wonderfully communicative monosyllabic grunts in this film over empty dialogue any day . Billy Zane heads a team of players who obviously really wanted to be in this film . Ricci is radiant as always , and the gods are shining when you can put Sandra Bernhard , Rick ( y ) Schroeder , Eartha Kitt and Andrew McCarthy 's name on the same poster . The design is perfect , the pyramid set exquisite , and Ron Perlman 's beastly performance is simply wonderful . Overall , this is a chaotic , visceral masterpiece lovingly crafted by fans of Ed Wood Jr . , auteur and cinenephile . A must see for anyone who really loves movies the way that the first rate Iliopulos and his cast obviously do . A film to make you wish you had made it yourself .  
  The actual crime story at the core of In Cold Blood might seem a little ' tame ' for those who are weened on the classic serial killer stories ( Gein , Bundy , Dahmer ) , or just the more notorious cases out in Hollywood ( OJ , Manson ) . The essential facts in the case don't amount to anything terribly convoluted : Perry Smith and Dick Hickock ( here played by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson respectively ) met by some luck , conspired to rob a man 's farmhouse safe out in Kansas , and after killing a family of four with a shotgun and dagger came away with 43 dollars . Aside from their returning to the US after fleeing briefly to Mexico , there isn't a whole lot of mystery to the resolution either . They were caught by some stroke of ironic chance ( a cop followed them and stopped them for having a stolen car after Smith and Hickcock helped out a boy and his old man collecting bottles for change ) , and sentenced to hang by the neck until dead . The story ended in 1965 . But it 's the handling of the story , moments of moot , the performances , a pure cinematic touch that Brooks and his absolutely marvelous ( the late / great ) DP Conrad Hall provides in crisp widescreen black and white , and a storytelling style that feels realistic without going into too much naturalism or too much melodrama ( save perhaps for near the end , which is pitch perfect ) . The air of tragedy hangs over the story , and not so much because of the killings themselves , no matter how brutal they are as the " third " man that is conjured up , as the narrator observes , by Smith and Hickcock teaming up , but because of the inevitability of the story . You feel somehow for these criminals , who in any other hands would be just be conventional figures or something out of a B-movie . These aren't good people , but they aren't necessarily monsters either , at least all the way through . It 's also an excellent ' road-movie ' as we see Smith and Hickcock on the road down to the Clutter residence ( the actual night-time scene of the crime taking place late in the film ) , then on to Mexico , then back to America towards Las Vegas . We get to soak in the personalities of these two , probably even more than that of the police detectives who at first have no leads and then finally get a break with an inmate . It 's actually kind of disturbing to get this close to these two ( sort of akin to the aimless quality of Malick 's Badlands characters ) , and it 's also a sign of daring for the period . There 's no sermonizing , like " he did this because of that and this or the other . " We see how Smith had an abusive , psychotic father , but that Smith loved and hated him . The complexity there is too much for the movie , maybe even too much for Capote 's book ( which , I should confess , I 've still yet to read , though I plan to ) . And we see Hickcock is this creature of slick confidence ( i . e . getting the suit and other things with bad checks ) , but without any deep-rooted explanation to it all . The streak of fatalism in In Cold Blood is some of the starkest of the 60s , and it 's the luck of Brooks to have its stars as Blake in his top of the pops performance ( this and Lost Highway , oddly enough considering his real life saga in recent years , his quintessential pieces of work ) , and Wilson 's breakthrough before becoming a character actor . While they 're surrounded by fine supporting work , they themselves are eerily absorbing , driven more or less by greed and fantasies of escapism with treasure , and staying pretty much grounded in their situation through the death row and on through their ends . Is this a morale of the story , if there could be one , that it 's more horrifying to confront the possibility that those who kill can't be classified , of good vs evil getting smudged ? Smith apologized for his crime before being hung , and he points out , " but to who ? " This is a story bound to give the most hardened fans of true-crime the bonafide chills , and it 's quite possibly the best American film of 1967 .  
  To " Bend It Like Beckham " may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about the other football ( soccer ) , but to English sports fans , it is equivalent to " Hit it Like Bonds " or " Dunk it Like Jordan . " Any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal , much like star player David Beckham does , much like the young Indian girl , Jess ( Parminder Nagra ) , does in the film Bend It Like Beckham . Jess loves to play pick up soccer games , the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother . However , while playing one day , a passing friend named Jules ( Keira Knightley ) sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling , all girls soccer team . After satisfying the coach Joe ( Jonathan Rhys-Meyers ) , she makes the team , something she knows her mother would not approve of . The movie is not about disobeying parents , but rather a girl doing what she wants to do , even if that goes against culture , not just the parents . There is humor thrown throughout the movie , especially when Jules ' mother thinks she 's a lesbian . The movie does resort to a bit of a cliché moment , as the big soccer game is the same day as Jess ' sister 's wedding , but it does not come off a cheesy , but rather fun and light . The soccer action looks good , so sports fans will enjoy it , and a story about girls growing up in a boy 's world , the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience . Bend It Like Beckham is not just about soccer , but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time , something that proves to be rather difficult .  
  Not one of your harder-hitting stories , and that 's a real strength of this film . There are at least two relationships in which less confident writers would have added some all-too predictable romantic tension . They not only spare the audience this , but throw in some surprises at the same time . There are a few Disney-ish moments , particularly near the end , but they are manageable . Overall , it was worth the rental and it was good , relaxed fun . BTW , if you get the DVD , watch the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi . We followed her directions and it was BRILLIANT ! Next time we will make it the day before we plan to eat it , because this is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to let the spices out !  
  " Bend It Like Beckham " reminds me of the best of those 80 's teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes . Everything takes place in a bubble-gum colored world where everyone is attractive , there are some easily-resolved conflicts that occasionally take away from the mostly happy proceedings , and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes . Nothing wrong with this , however . " Bend It Like Beckham " is an absolute treat from beginning to end . My wife and I found ourselves totally won over by the cornball cheesiness even as we were making fun of it , and at the end , as embarrassing as this is to admit , we applauded ( and we saw this , by the way , in our living room , not in a theatre ) . Watch this movie and enjoy . Grade : B +  
  As a former 2 time Okinawan Karate world champion , I like movies about sacrifice for sport . But this movie is about so much more . This movie is so good and so deep . I have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion . Almost lights out for me . And this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a daze it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about . This is a movie about living . Living your life for yourself and respect for others . Empowerment . God , bless " Bend it like Beckham " I believe it is a true gem .  
  New York , I Love You finally makes it to our shores , but its 10 short stories on love somehow didn't find reason enough to be released over Valentine 's , probably due to the fact that this year 's festival also falls on Lunar New Year , and with that comes the usual LNY blockbuster films from the likes of Jackie Chan ( no , not The Spy Next Door ) and local filmmaker Jack Neo who has traditionally released his latest film over that period to resounding success . So why fix a formula that hasn't been broken ? Continuing in concept where Paris , Je T'aime had begun in spawning the City of Love Franchise ( Shanghai will be next , so says the end of the closing credits here ) , the buzz here is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme , although someone probably forgot to tell Scarlett Johansson some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules , and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else ( well , it was shot in black and white ) , but here 's hoping that it would make it to the DVD at least . Structurally , this series is less compartmentalized compared to its predecessor , which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created . Here a little more leeway is given , where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together , and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes , in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers , though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise , though already seen in Paris . One of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one , is definitely the creative forces behind the stories , from writers , directors and cinematographers from various geographies and backgrounds mirroring the makeup of the cosmopolitan city , coming together for a concept film . And what more the star-studded cast too , with big names amongst the lesser known ones all upping the ante through picture perfect performances , be it for the entire length of the short , or as a support to build upon . You can't deny the initial star-gazing in recognizing the notables , from Irrfan Khan to Natalie Portman ( who also had writing and directing duties ) , Rachel Bilson ( looking quite like Bardot ) to Spielberg 's blue eye boy Shia LaBeouf , who surprisingly can act , and shows off more in his few minutes here than his entire filmography to date . Story wise , like any anthology , you 'll find some which will automatically appeal to you , and with others that don't . Some are straightforward in nature , while others have to come up with gimmicky twists that thankfully worked . But these 10 stories plus 1 ( because Randall Balsmeyer was given duties to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established landmarks ) somehow lacked the more " anything goes " spirit from its predecessor , with stories more rooted in reality , compared to some fantastical elements in the previous film ( Elijah Wood 's dalliance with a vampire anyone ? ) , or even less adventurous with its narrative style ( Christopher Doyle 's , and Tom Tykwer 's starring Natalie Portman ) . Here it seemed that the filmmakers opted very much for safe , with none venturing into that spirit of adventure and experiment . Minor quibbles aside , I still enjoyed almost all the shorts here , contrary to what many others have felt about it . The short film format is still very much alive , and having them strung together into a feature under the City of Love banner works fine , and left me wondering which other cities are or have been included in its lineup . I am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence here . We surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be stringing together a Singapore , I Love You , so here 's crossing my fingers that maybe something will materialize down the road . Otherwise there 's always the Sawasdee Bangkok route of just making it without any attachments to franchise house rules .  
  Bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors . Lorne Greene , Pernell Whitaker , Michael Landon , Dan Blocker , and even Guy Williams ( as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace Adam when he was leaving the series ) . The cast had chemistry , and they seemed to genuinely like each other . That made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have . It also made many of their best stories into great western drama . Like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season , there are bound to be some weak ones . However , most of the time each episode had an interesting story , some kind of conflict , and a resolution that usually did not include violence . While Bonanza was a western , the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction . While I am a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted : Dead Or Alive ; those shows usually ended with a gunfight . Gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict , and Bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing . In the early years of Bonanza , there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights . Those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series , but they are pretty good in and of themselves . In 1964 , when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the show , Guy Williams was brought in to replace him . Williams was playing the role of a long-lost cousin . Unfortunately , Whitaker decided to stay one more year , and thus Williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry Adam 's old girlfriend . If Williams had stayed on for the duration of Bonanza , one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965 , when Pernell Whitaker left the show . Undoubtedly , once Pernell Whitaker left the series , the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks . Whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes , and his absence left a void in the cast . Little Joe always wanted to play the nice kid , and Hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold . Since Ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family , that did not leave too much room for any gunfights . At some point they hired a ranch hand called Candy ( David Canary ) who became their fourth member of the cast , but Candy was never featured in any gunfights , and he was hardly more than an older version of Little Joe . For a year or two they also had Ben take in some other lost cousin ( Jamie , played by the forgettable Mitch Vogel ) who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone . Apparently by adding the teenager , the studio was looking to attract younger viewers . It also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems , alcohol , delinquency , etc . Those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counter-culture movement . Dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order TV , though Hawaii 5-0 , The F.B.I. and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing TV shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief , mayhem , and crime . The addition of a teenager to the cast gave the Cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems , but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general . After Dan Blocker died , the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled . The last season was pretty bad , as it featured Little Joe tracking down the killers of his wife , and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because Little Joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife , and how unfair it was that she was killed . I don't think I have ever seen the last episode of the series , and I wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way . By the last year , there was only Ben ( Lorne Greene ) actually living on the Ponderosa , as Adam had moved away ( and never came back even once as a guest ) and Hoss had died and Little Joe had left after his wife ( in the series ) had been killed by drifters . Overall , the era from 1959-1965 is the best of this series . Once Adam left , it slowly declined . Most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too . By 1970 , the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical , and it had lost a lot of its western flavor . The addition of Candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the show , and the death of Hoss ( Dan Blocker ) was the final nail . Bonanza is probably the best western series ever made , and of the 465 episodes that were produced , at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama ! That is a pretty good record . Even the worst of Bonanza is better than a lot of other TV shows .  
  I would just like to say , that no matter how low budget the film is , it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies . We don't read that much anymore , instead people want to see movies . Having this series out on DVD , has made me want to read the whole series , and want more . PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES . Please don't change any of the characters either , it ruins the effect . Because I have grown to love the actors who have played the characters . PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES . I want to see the message , and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray . We don't get that enough anymore . AWESOME JOB !  
  It ran from 1959-1973 . Its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series . Its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50 's , psychedelic 60 's and remained popular in the 70 's . I remember repeats of this series . It was a successful combination of all its elements from stories , cast and productions that made it exceptional . Lorne Green had his defining iconic character from this series . Its appeal was across generations . All members of the family could enjoy this . It balanced morality with violence , humour with seriousness . A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact . The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance .  
  This movie is wonderful . It always has been always will be . I 'm mean really what is better then a house maid falling in love . Walt really out did him self here . And the music ! A dream is a wish your heart makes is beautiful ! What else can you say besides terrific ! I can't wait until the special edition comes out it will be so awesome ! I can't wait to hear all of the deleted songs ! This movie is done so beautiful and smart ! It is lovely . What about the cute mice too ! I know i keep saying the same things over and over and over again but hey this is a great movie ! Woods was terrific in this beautiful beautiful BEAUTIFUL movie  
  For quite a long time in my life , I either did not like this film , or I liked this film but not as much as many more . I watched it recently ( at a sleepover , funnily enough ) and I liked it more than I had done since I was under 6 or something . I now appreciate it more , as I do with a few other Disney classics that I have watched recently ( including " Sleeping Beauty " and " Pinnochio " or however you spell it ) . I now very much appreciate the animation , the clever " Disney " plot turns , the humour from the mice , the emotions expressed and the plot . The animation is very well done , often it seems you are wherever the other characters are , watching them . The animation also does well portraying the styles of the backgrounds , including the town ( which is shown twice briefly ) . Disney changes this from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way , injecting clever plot turns , such as the mice making the clothes and the key part ( usually I do not like Disney films very much if they are not that similar to the original story , but with this I am not overly bothered . I feel they made necessary changes to make this a good Disney film . Often I do not think Disney changed the book in a good way in some of their films ) . You know the story already , Cinderella is a girl working for her horrible stepmother and stepsisters . She goes to a ball with the help of her fairy godmother and loses a glass slipper .. This is a film very much to be watched with other people . Immediate family is not good enough . To enjoy this , I recommend you watch it with friends ( and immediate family , if you like . : - ) ) . I recommend this to people who like Disney at least a little bit , people who like fairy tales and for people who like mice . Enjoy ! : - )  
  Walt Disney & his 9 Old Men put their own 1950 spin on the classic fairy tale of Cinderella , which I guess you could say helps form an unofficial " fairy tale princess trilogy " from the classic Disney years . THE PLOT : Cinderella is a nice girl who can't catch a break . She is the daughter of a nice , wealthy widower who loved her dearly , but her mother passed away when Cinderella was very young , and Cindy 's father felt she needed a mother figure , so he eventually married the woman who would become known as Lady Tremaine , herself a widow with two daughters about the same age as Cinderella , Anastasia and Drizella . At first they all seemed to get along , but then Cinderella 's father died , and Lady Tremaine 's true nature was revealed - she was a cold , cruel , callous , heartless , mean spirited woman , and she passed those traits on to her daughters , who were spoiled , bratty , and equally mean spirited . Anastasia & Drizella hate Cinderella because they know deep down that she 's better looking and an overall nicer , more attractive lady than themselves ( i . e . , more appealing to men ) , and their mother , Lady Tremaine , hates Cindy for pretty much the same reasons . As the years passed Lady Tremaine began to squander the family fortunes in a stubborn but futile quest to improve / refine her awkward , unattractive daughters ( to call them " homely " would be an insult to homely people everywhere ) while all three relegated Cinderella to being the multi-tasking servant of the house , abusing her , mistreating her and humiliating her every chance they get ( they are particularly fond of increasing her already absurd workload ) . That brings us to Cinderella in the present , where she has blossomed into a good looking young lady who somehow manages to remain kind hearted and nice despite her abusive step family and holds on to the hope that one day the tables will turn in her favor . Cinderella gets her shot at freedom & happiness when a royal ball is held to introduce the local prince to an eligible young maiden so that he can take her as a wife , settle down , start a family , etc . Naturally , her step family tries to keep her from attending , even going so far as to physically assault her and rip up the dress she had procured for herself ( with a little help from her mice friends - the dress belonged to her biological mother ) . Finally pushed beyond her breaking point , Cinderella runs out into the courtyard and cries in despair . It is at that point that her Fairy Godmother , a short , plump , jolly woman , arrives and provides Cinderella with transportation and a transformed dress ( after all , Cinderella wouldn't make a very good impression at the ball if she entered the scene looking like she had just gotten gang raped ) . Cindy arrives at the ball , the Prince falls hard for her , but that pesky midnight rule gets in the way , forcing her to flee , but leaving behind a glass slipper . Make a long story short - after a long harrowing quest to find the mystery girl via trying on the glass slipper , Cinderella is found and she and the prince get married , giving her the happy ending she deserves . Overall , an enjoyable Disney classic . Not without its flaws , the most glaring of which is that the Prince is little more than a MacGuffin to help push the plot along - he has very little screen time and even less dialogue , so we never get to know him very well or get a good look at his relationship with Cinderella ( which is unfortunate since , according to the making of documentary , the Prince was originally meant to play a bigger role ) , and a few additional scenes to help flesh out Cinderella herself might have been helpful ( there was a song that showed her fantasizing of turning into an army of maids to clean up the house as well as eavesdropping on her step-family post ball to show her amusement at their jealousy , which was cut because Walt himself thought it made her look spiteful ) . Still , Cinderella herself is a likable enough heroine , even if she is upstaged by her mice friends , and there 's a sweetness to the film that is becoming harder to find these days . Of course , if this were being made now , Cinderella would probably put up more of a struggle against her family during the dress ripping scene and would probably free herself in the climax ( either by picking the lock herself or making an impractical yet exciting jump down from her window ) but this is beside the point . And for all those who say Cinderella sets a bad example for young girls , well , consider this - at least Cinderella didn't go around getting publicly drunk and indecently exposed , unlike some modern day " princesses " ( you know who I mean ) .  
  Cinderella is a beautiful film , with beautiful songs of course . In fact , it 's one of the best films of the 1950 's . I think all the characters are portrayed amazingly . You can see the cruelness of Cinderella 's stepsisters and her stepmother , the sweetness of Cinderella . The mice are funny and sweet too . I think they changed the tale a bit , but I think it 's for the best . It 's such a nice film , and I don't think anyone could resist it deep down . I give it a 8/10 . I don't think it 's the best Disney film . But it sure is a true classic .  
  * Might not consider this having a spoiler , but I 'd rather be cautious than careless * I never saw this movie when I was little . I fell in love with it the first time I saw it with my three year old daughter . I can watch it over and over again . For the little acting Ilene Woods did in her lifetime , she was a wonderful voice for Cinderella ; very appealing ; very believable . The music really fit the movie perfectly . The acting was great ; loved the mice ! You really " hated " Lady Tremain and the step-sisters ; they were just awful . The cartoonists depicted the spoiled behavior very well . This is a wonderful movie , especially if you are into love stories . My daughter has seen the movie about 25 times and still gets excited at the end .  
  I 've never laughed and giggled so much in my life ! The first half kept me in stitches ; the last half made me come completely unglued ! I think I giggled for 15 minutes after the tape was over . His timing and delivery for his stories is almost unequaled . And though he talks fast , you catch every joke . Which is probably why my " laugh center " was so overwhelmed ; it took an extra 15 minutes to laugh at everything .  
  BASEketball is an extremely funny movie that delivers acting that generally makes the movie alot funnier , comedy material that is more than crap in your pants funny , and a pretty good plot despite the fact that its the classic slackers v . s the evil rich guy . The one and only thing I didnt like about BASEketball , was that that kid wasnt really needed in the movie , but , if the kid wasnt in the movie , some of the funny scenes wouldnt have existed . If you have read any pro reviews about this movie , exclude them all because basically all the reviewers didnt like this film . BASEketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want . 8 out of 10 .  
  There are some films that every Horror fan owes himself ( or herself ) to see , and Emilio Miraglia 's " La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte " aka . " The Red Queen Kills Seven Times " ( 1972 ) is definitely one of them . With Gialli and Gothic Tales being my two favorite sub-genres in Horror , I was looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while , and even though my expectations were high , this masterpiece surpassed my greatest hopes . Miraglia 's earlier Giallo , " The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave " ( 1971 ) was already a creepy and highly atmospheric film which successfully mixed Giallo with Gothic Horror , but it couldn't possibly compare to this instant personal favorite . " The Red Queen Kills Seven Times " is , hands down , one of the most unique and overwhelming Italian Horror films ever made , and no lover of the genre could possibly consider missing it . An incredibly mesmerizing Giallo with strong Gothic elements , " The Red Queen " delivers everything one could hope for in either sub-genre : An inventive and incredibly compelling plot , spine-chilling suspense , a sublimely uncanny setting and a genuinely creepy atmosphere , eerily lush colors , stylish murders , a brilliant score , and , not least , a ravishing female cast lead by the stunningly beautiful Barbara Bouchet - this film simply is one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and pure terror . The film starts out incredibly in a beautiful Gothic castle in Germany . As little girls , Kitty Wildenbrück and her sister Evelyn have been fighting when their grandfather tells them the story behind an incredibly uncanny painting : Legend has it that a fiendish Red Lady is to return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people . Fourteen years later , Kitty ( Barbara Bouchet ) has become a successful fashion photographer . Suddenly , people begin to get murdered .. Director Miraglia had already proved his incredible talent for style , atmosphere and colorful creepiness with " The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave " and he makes use of these elements even far more effectively in this gem . " The Red Queen Kills Seven Times " is a feast for the eyes indeed , and one of the most overwhelming Italian Horror films both visually and plot-wise . The haunting painting in the Grandfather 's castle alone is capable of giving the viewer the goosebumps . The Red Lady ( or Red Queen , as she is called in the English title ) is arguably the most fiendish figure ever in a Giallo , the spine-chilling laughter that the murders are accompanied by would even be frightening on its own . A sexy female cast is always appreciated , especially in a Giallo , and this one is a prime example for that . The ravishing Barbara Bouchet ( one of my favorite actresses ) must be one of the most stunningly beautiful ladies ever to appear on screen , and she is a great actress too . Bouchet 's presence has graded up many Italian flicks , among other appearances she starred in three of the greatest Cult-masterpieces of Italian 70s cinema within one year ( 1972 ) : Fernando Di Leo 's " Milano Calibro 9 " , Lucio Fulci 's Giallo-highlight " Don't Torture a Duckling " and this unforgettable gem . Apart from the wonderful Miss Bouchet , the film 's gorgeous female cast includes sexy young Sybil Danning , Marina Malfatti ( " The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave " ) , and other beauties who are not afraid to bare it for the camera . As the whole film , the murders are stylish and extremely elegant , yet frightening and macabre , and some of them are quite gory . Bruno Nicolai 's mesmerizing score is as memorable as it gets , and makes the film 's intensely eerie atmosphere even more haunting . The plot is ingeniously convoluted and full of red herrings , the tension-level increses with each passing minute . " The Red Queen .. " begins creepy and it stays stunning to the last second . Overall , this is one of the films that I cannot find enough words of praise for . " The Red Queen Kills Seven Times " is an absolute masterpiece that easily ranks among the finest Gialli ever made , and a top-priority for every fan of Horror and / or Italian cinema to see . 10/10  
  I watch a lot of films , good , bad and indifferent ; there is usually something of interest to fixate upon , even if it is only set design , or the reliable labor of a good character actor , or the fortuitous laughter that emerges from watching ineptitude captured forever . However , I was quite pleasantly surprised by this film , one I had never seen before . Graham Greene has been translated into film many times of course , in such masterpieces as " Thin Man " and in lesser vehicles . " Confidential Agent " is one of those lesser vehicles , yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway , despite lackluster direction , the incongruity of Bacall and Boyer 's depictions as ( respectively ) British and Spanish , and the almost complete non-existence of any chemistry between the two leads . In some ways , this last " problem " actually begins to work in the film 's favor , for how can love really blossom in the killing atmosphere of fascism and capitalism meeting about one person 's tragedy ? The most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from Greene 's complex and guilt-ridden psychology , which pervades the film . I know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull , and I can understand that . Yet I found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is a claustrophobic world . I was compelled to watch , not by any great acting ( although Boyer is marvelous as usual , managing to convey a rich mixture of world-weariness , tragedy , hope , and fervor with his magnificent voice and yearning eyes ) , but by the down-spiraling rush of one man 's slim hopes against a world of oppression and money . What is a thief ? What good is love in the face of death ? Where does mere profit-taking end and exploitation begin ? The film does not rise to the level of art , and thus cannot hope to answer such questions , but it is much more than mere entertainment , and its murders and guilts are very grimly drawn . The lack of glitz , of " bubble , " of narrative " bounce " help to make this movie very worthwhile . And there is no happy ending , for history wrote the ending .  
  Writer / director Henry Brommel has done a wonderful job with his film , " Panic , " from the year 2000 , and that includes his choice of cast : William H . Macy , Tracy Ullman , John Ritter , Neve Campbell , Donald Sutherland , Barbara Bain , David Dorfman . Brommel has cast Ullman and Ritter in decidedly un-funny roles , and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see . " Panic " is the story of a hit man , Alex ( Macy ) who actually works for his father ( Sutherland ) . He covers his true profession by doing mail order work ; by all appearances , he and his wife ( Ullman ) and their son Sammy ( Dorfman ) are a typical suburban family . Unhappy with his life , Alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist ( Ritter ) , telling only his mother ( Bain ) . In the waiting room , he meets a young woman ( Campbell ) to whom he is immediately attracted , which complicates his situation further . His mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist . When Alex receives his next assignment , he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist . This is a profound story of a gentle , good man made into a killer by a monster of a father , with his mother 's knowledge , who kills to please his father but also can't stand up to him and quit . His rage is so deep-seated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son - and it 's finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression . When it 's time for " Panic " to moves , it does - quickly . " Panic " doesn't seem panicked at all . In fact , it moves very slowly . But it moves slowly not because it 's poorly made - the slowness is deliberate , mirroring Alex 's own psyche slowly coming out of the fog . By making a decision about Sara , the Campbell character , and by seeing his mark , his own psychiatrist , as a living , breathing human being , Alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is - and how they don't jive . And the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche , Sammy 's . William Macy gives another brilliant performance , as a loving father , a distant husband , and a cold killer , the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires , a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated . This is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater . It 's too adult , too small , too subtle , too character-driven , and too good .  
  I gather from reading the previous comments that this film went straight to cable . Well , I paid to see it in a theatre , and I 'm glad I did because visually it was a striking film . Most of the settings seem like they were made in the early 60s ( except for the shrink 's office , which was dated in a different way ) , and if you leave the Neve Campbell sequences out , the whole film has a washed - out early 60s ambience . And the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating . For a first-time director whose background , I believe , is in writing , he has a great eye . Within the first ten minutes I felt the plot lacked plausibility , so I just willingly suspended my disbelief and went along for the ride . In terms of acting and the depiction of father-son , mother-son , husband-wife , parent-child relationships , the film was spot-on . William H . Macy , a pleasure to watch , seems to be filling the void left by the late Tony Perkins , if this and Magnolia are any indication . Tracey Ullman as the neglected wife was quite moving , to me . It was a three-dimensional depiction of a character too often viewed by society as two-dimensional . Of course , Donald Sutherland can add this to his collection of unforgettable portrayals . The depiction of the parents ( Bain / Sutherland ) reminded me , in an indirect way , of Vincent Gallo 's BUFFALO ' 66 , although toned-down quite a bit ! I would definitely pay money to see a second film from this director . He has the self-discipline of a 50s b-crimefilm director ( something P.T.Anderson will never have ! ) , yet he has a visual style and a way with actors that commands attention .  
  I have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me . Most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up , show off sexy models , and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window . With that said , the Bourne series has been fantastic . Doug Liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style , showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly . This is not the sci-fi absurdity that was Bond ( before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less ) . There was a lot to worry for when the Bourne Supremacy came out . With director Paul Greengrass taking over , what could have been a second-hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair . The stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it . Greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment , The Bourne Ultimatum . In what is an amazing conclusion to a top-notch trilogy , the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised . Once again , Bourne is brought into the minds of the CIA by false pretenses . Someone has leaked information about the Treadstone upgrade called Blackbriar and once Bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story , he is assumed to be the mole . Only Pamela Landy , she who was on the case to find him in Supremacy , knows that he can't be the one . Bourne 's motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace . It has been the CIA who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them . What ends up transpiring is that Bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer . The film , then , becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends , or if Bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him . In what is probably the simplest storyline of the series , with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story , it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression . This is not a detriment at all , however , as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot . Admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight , between Bourne and the CIA 's second asset , alone . The chase jumping through windows in Madrid is cool on its own , but when they finally meet up , we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you 'll see . Also , rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films , we instead get around three small scale road races , just as intense , but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony . After five years of waiting , we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling . By the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him . No one could have done it better than Matt Damon . He has the physique and attitude to be believable in the action sequences , but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him . Joan Allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job , but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how Brian Cox 's character , from the first two films , took matters into his own hands . Needing a role in that mold , we are given a nice turn from David Strathairn . Like Cox , he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision . With as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the Blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country , you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing . Even the little guys do a wonderful job , like Paddy Considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything , Albert Finney as a man from Bourne 's past and possibly key to his origin , and Edgar Ramirez as one of the CIA 's operatives sent to take Bourne out . Ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by Clive Owen ( Identity ) , Karl Urban , and Martin Csokas ( Supremacy ) . He doesn't talk much , if at all , but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in Domino . In the end , one has to applaud Paul Greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them . His skill at the close-up hand-held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as Tony Scott , but without quite the seizure-inducing cuts . Rather than feel like over - production , his use of hand-held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action . Let 's also credit cinematographer Oliver Wood , who shot all three Bourne films . He was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them .  
  This is one of the best reunion specials ever , with Adam West and Burt Ward parodying themselves and having fun while doing it . It 's amazing the amount of effort that went into the detail , particularly recapturing the feel of the 1960 's era , the Batcave set , Wayne Manor , the costumes , and the actors selected to play the younger versions of West , Ward , Burgess Meredith , Cesar Romero , and Frank Gorshin ! This 90 minutes is well worth your time , and is a delight to all fans of the classic 1960 's " Batman " television series . I note that clips from " Batman " were from the movie , and not the series itself , probably because of legal restrictions . Let 's hope the three seasons of the show are forthcoming on DVD .  
  I really enjoyed this . I got it thinking it was going to be a documentary , but it revealed itself as a good piece of tongue in cheek fun . I think this has been well done , pretty much an extended TV show into a film , but due to the characters or rather original actors willingness to have fun and be made fun off helps this work in a great old style Innocent way . If you are a fan of the original TV series then i am sure you will enjoy this . Q  
  In what is a truly diverse cast , this show hits it 's stride on FOX . It is the kind of sitcom that grows on you . If you just watch 1 show you might not like it much , but once you watch two or three - you get hooked . This is because some of the jokes hit & some miss depending upon how you view them . As is usual today , the themes are very mature . The humor is usually very mature too . Often the most funny parts are the parts where the mature themes collide with the innocent ones . Red ( Kurtwood Smith ) a veteran actor does some very good deadpan type of humor on this show . Debra Jo Rupp plays well in this ensemble cast too . Danny Masterson , the oldest actor of the " kids " is very good too . Laura Prepon ( Donna ) looks better in the earlier shows as a natural redhead ( who got the idea of making her a blonde ? ) . She shows very good talent & comedic timing often . She looks good without make up too . This is one of the better entries on FOX in the sitcom department & it 's most successful live action one since Married With Children  
  .. and the series lets you forget all that . I am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series . Born in 1958 , I learned to drive during the first gas shortage , and got my first post-college graduation job during the second gas shortage in 1979 . The 70 's were a truly dreadful time to be young - inflation , competing for after-school minimum-wage jobs with laid-off thirty-somethings , dreadful music , worse clothes . The funny thing is , this series doesn't ignore any of that and still manages to make the 70 's look fun , even for those of us old enough to know better . It manages to look the 70 's directly in the face - complete with time-authentic clothing - and yet fill the show with the hopefulness of youth and the things that make the high school and college years both the best of times and the worst of times . Then there are the parents . The two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - truly have dreadful parents with the best of intentions . Eric 's parents , Red and Kitty , are not exactly June and Ward although they are conventional for the decade . They represent what happened when the 60 's finally reached the suburbs during the 1970 's . Donna 's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960 's to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness legitimacy . Eric 's friends Fez , Kelso , and Jackie round out the group representing nerdiness , well-meaning incompetence , and snobbishness respectively . Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs , but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely absentee and negligent parents . I highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does lag a bit due to the absence of Eric .  
  An imagination is a terrible thing to waste .. especially when you have talented actors . Writer / Director Jones wastes no time in siding the viewer with his protagonist . Anyone who has shared an apartment with a slob will be crying with laughter . Anyone who has arrived while a meter maid places a ticket on your windshield will just plain cry . We 've all wanted to rip a terrible toupee off a man 's head . These are only snippets of what 's in store when watching " Cross Eyed " , a heartfelt film that should be a stepping stone for Jones and his wry sense of humor both in front and behind the camera .  
  This is your standard musical comedy from the ' 30 's , with a big plus that it features some well known ' 30 's actors in small fun cameo 's . There is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and ' no-worries ' overall kind of atmosphere , with a typical Hal Roach comedy touch to it . Appereantly it 's a ' Cinderella story ' but I most certainly didn't thought of it that way while watching the movie . The story gets very muddled in into the storytelling , that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance , when the main characters hit the Hollywood studios . Of course the highlight of the movie is when Laurel & Hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines . It 's like watching a movie and getting a Laurel & Hardy short with it for free . Also Laurel & Hardy regular Walter Long makes an appearance in the routine and James Finlayson ( without a mustache this time ) as the director of the short . It 's certainly true that all of the cameo 's and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem , since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main character . The movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period , though the rating on here would suggest otherwise . 7/10  
  I fell in love with this silent action drama . Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played this so well . Raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting , Todd ( Kurt Russell ) is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered soldiers . The stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born - SOLDIER . Not Rambo , not Schwarzenegger , not Bruce Willis , not Mel Gibson , not Jason Statham - Kurt Russell owns this role and made it entirely his - original , daring , and all too human . I miss the fact that sequels were never made . 10/10 - LD _ my faith : http : / ww . angelfire . com / ny5 / jbc33 /  
  Kurt Russell is strong and ( mostly ) silent in this futuristic action-thriller from Paul Anderson ( Event Horizon , Resident Evil . ) Set on a garbage-dump planet , Soldier plays like a cross between Rambo and Shane , with Russell barely speaking as the title character , an " obsolete " genetic soldier left for dead . The supporting cast of colonists , including Connie Nielsen , Sean Pertwee and a surprisingly hirsute Michael Chiklis , is able . They spend most of the movie being scared of Russell , and the rest of it running for their lives . Russell 's performance here is one of the best he 's ever given . With almost no words to say , he conveys emotion , feeling and meaning with looks and glances . It is almost a mime performance . When the action sequences kick into gear , he kicks ass-and does so in a strong , silent , matter-of fact way . There are flaws . Jason Scott Lee is brutish as a " superior " genetic soldier . Jason Isaacs does a great impression of Frank Burns from M * A * S * H as a weaselly commanding officer , and Gary Busey busts a gut ( and nearly busts his girdle ) as Todd 's mentor . This is an underrated , and excellent sci-fi flick , and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of Blade Runner-David Webb Peoples wrote both screenplays .  
  I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing . Everything about this movie seemed to click , the storyline , the characters , the setting . As far as film is concerned I wouldn't call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic . It gets it 's meaning across . The cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie . Corben Berbson , Fred Gwynne , Ruben Blades , and Ed O'Neil are hilarious . For this who haven't seen it , I will give you a brief synopsis : Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist . However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey , they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose . The film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven , only with four criminals who can't stand each other , and in Montana rather than Las Vegas . All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you to see this movie .  
  I 've just seen this movie for the second time on television . It 's lovely , warm , sentimental , very very romantic . I 've rarely seen actors better able to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another - Cybill Shepherd , Ryan O'Neal , Robert Downey , Jr . and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply outdo themselves . Masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable . The movie is in the vein of both romantic movies such as While You Were Sleeping , When Harry Met Sally , Sleepless in Seattle and the " high gimmick " sorts of movies like Big , Back to the Future , Peggy Sue Got Married . I hate to say this , because this cast was superb and I 'd never change any of them - but I think it didn't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as Meg Ryan , Tom Hanks , Michael J . Fox , and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made . It 's not superbly written - e . g . , the characters ' lines are not particularly memorable . Yet it 's executed to perfection . The romantic yearnings are truly palpable , the " feeling " of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated , love 's timelessness and all-encompassing sweep , the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection , are so touchingly delivered . Again and again , you will find yourself moved . Actually , a comparable movie is Made in Heaven - the same romantic yearning . Do see this - it 's lovely .  
  Put quite simply , this film is terrifying . It starts off simply , looking like a study of a rebellious young girl and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror film . Don't expect gore , or zombies . This is psychological , and just as he would also do in Candyman , Bernard Rose manages to convey the horror that is not being believed . Each time you watch this film , you realise more about what 's happening , and about how the two worlds in this film interconnect . Drawings have never been scarier .  
  Paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film I 've ever seen . Often classed as a " horror movie " this , I believe , is a grave error . Some journo once called it " the thinking person 's Nightmare on Elm Street " and while I accept the logic of his conclusion I can't help but think it 's a tag that is ill deserved and misleading . Those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate they 're really not thinking at all . In fact , just attempting to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea . Quite simply , Paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart . As someone wiser than me once said , " the film hits you on a completely emotional level " , which may go some way to explaining why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing . To be honest , I make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine for your taste , stop reading now because there 's more to come . It 's so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives . Even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it all work . In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of Paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood ( often overlooked ) in a seamless and convincing way . And yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away . Add to all this an incredibly talented director ( Bernard Rose ) , imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you 're ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why I have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words can express .  
  OK , I would not normally watch a Farrelly brothers movie . I can't recall ever watching one . I also don't recall watching a Jimmy Fallon movie . Alright , I did watch taxi , but I said penance and was forgiven for that mistake . But , this movie had Drew Barrymore and I just think she is the cutest thing . I don't know what it is about her , but I just smile the whole time I am watch her . She just captivates me that way . I mean I even watched Adam Sandler just to see her in 50 First Dates . How sad is that ? This wasn't the greatest baseball movie - it wasn't supposed to be . It was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for . It had a predictable ending , but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile .  
  Having just finished Cronicles of the Heroic Knight mere minutes ago I find myself extremely please but questions still loom over me . While it would appear that the first 7 episodes or so are actually a retelling of the events of the first Record of Lodoss War the truth is that they really aren't . It would appear that the creator of CotHK had a different vision as to how the original ended ( and that may be the reason that the first 7 episodes occur ) but I do not find that to be the case . CotHK does say it starts 5 years after the War of Heros which Parn was a part of . I think the director made the first 5 episodes seem so much like a recap of the original just to give the viewer a small reminder and an introduction to characters and their deeds done because they appear much less after the series kicks into Spark 's story . Now , once the series does kick into Spark 's portion we find ourselves kicked up another 10 years ( 15 years now since the War of Heros ) . Spark and his crew do , in some cases , resemble Parn and his crew once the journey kicks into gear , especially the love story that brews between Spark and Neese . I also thought several times throughout CotHK that I threw in the original series and if it wasn't for Spark 's long blue hair I know I would 've pressed stop more than once to make sure the right disc was in . By no means do I consider these major set backs however , the writers did a fine job in crafting believable characters and a remarkable storyline . The only thing that makes me hurt is that Ashram and Wagnard return . Umm .. how ? Don't get me wrong both are great villains even though Ashram 's only villainous trait is that he supports the Marmo . Perhaps I missed something during the coarse of the series that explained that part . As far as sequels go though , I highly recommend CotHK . I place both CotHK and , even more so , the original Record of Lodoss War far above the Lord of the Rings trilogy . Both of these are more epic than anything I 've ever seen or read . I highly recommend this .  
  This movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast , a gripping story with a chilling ending , great music , and excellent visuals without significant special effects . It is interesting to note though that , like so much science fiction , its predictions for the future don't appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted . That 's not to say we 're out of the woods yet , but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition . It shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics : " 1984 " , " 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( compare its space station with our International Space Station ) and Isaac Asimov 's " I Robot " ( positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990 's ) .  
  I loved This Movie . When I saw it on Febuary 3rd I knew I had to buy It ! It comes out to buy on July 24th ! It has cool deaths scenes , Hot girls , great cast , good story , good acting . Great Slasher Film . the Movies is about some serial killer killing off four girls . SEE this movies  
  The information contained in this movie is somewhat familiar to many who have been paying attention to the news lately . The Walter Reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job taking care of our injured heroes when they return . What this movie further shows is a truth common to all wars . The psychological trauma that soldiers suffer while engaging in war and the difficulty they have when returning to civilian life . They are not just changed or affected , they are different people and most do not know how to deal with that as they do not know themselves . Finally , this film shows what the military does to our young men in women in getting them ready for war and the policies and practices that they have to follow in prosecuting war that leads to all the psychological trauma . We have over 3000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion ; but we have many tens of thousands that will suffer lifelong physical and psychological trauma because of this war . It doesn't matter what side you are on , it behooves you to know the cost of war to decide if we should be in that business . This film illustrates the costs to the men and women perfectly .  
  Simply the best Estonian film that I have ever seen , although it is made by a Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi . Tallin Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold , a national treasure that belongs to the republic of Estonia . But at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at that time . In the early 90s Soviet Union fell into pieces and many countries , such as Estonia , became independent . Now the conditions may be better in most of those countries . But in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had left them as inheritance . ( And many of them still do .. at least on some level .. ) Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and with a well-written script . The actors are also very good , especially Jüri Järvet ( perhaps the best known Estonian actor , plays Snaut in Tarkovski 's Solaris ) , playing and old gangster who 's slowly becoming tired of his way of life . But the most astonishing performance comes from Monika Mäger , a child-actor playing Terje , a boyish girl in her early teens , whose presence in the plot is quite essential . ( and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb-credit list ! ) w There are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time . But Tallinn Pimeduses does that . Unfortenately Järvi-Laturi 's other films are far from this kind of achievements . His first one , Kotia päin was too artificial and his latest , History is Made at Night was just a weird mess .  
  I thought it was a pretty good movie and should have been released in theaters first . It wouldn't have been a big Blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money . The movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world . Justin Timberlake did a good job . I wasn't expecting Justin Timberlake to do that good a job . Considering it is his first movie he did a good job . This is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just don't know what you want to rent that night . It should go pretty well . The cast was great . So I highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out !  
  I absolutely loved this film ! I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful . I remember how hard it was when John was shot . However , watching the " Two of Us " took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility . I think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what " might have been . " Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and met the challenge head on . I was impressed with his accent and mannerisms . Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite believable as John . My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so poignant . The film left me with both sadness and satisfaction , both of which I feel are appropriate , given the circumstances .  
  This show started out with great mystery episodes . I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes . After that , the show started playing short episodes with Shaggy , Scooby doo , and Scrappy doo . I think Hanna Barbera Productions had to change 20 minutes episodes into short episodes . Some of the voice actors became unavailable . After 15 or 16 episodes , Frank Welker ( who played Fred ) became unavailable . I think the voice of Velma changes after first 12 episodes , because the first voice actress who played Velma was unavailable . And the network ordered the Hanna Barbera studio to make more shorts with Shaggy , Scooby doo , and Scrappy doo , because the ratings were high . So they had to make more shorts . I wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes . Still it is a good show .  
  These slasher pics are past their sell by date , but this one is good fun . The valentine cards themselves are witty , and well thought out . The film has one Peach of a line .. " He 's no Angel .. " when he in fact IS Angel ! Watching Buffy reruns will never be the same ! The cast is a sizzling display of young talent , but the story does not give them enough real depth . Denise Richards on the DVD extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters . Sorry but NO ! The direction is very good , managing to show very little actual gore , and relying on your imaginations implied threat . Much can be said also for the similar manner in which Miss Richards and Heigel do not remove their clothes .. : - ( Essentially , the main directorial plus , lies within the " borrowing " of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks . Psycho 's shower scene is tributed , along with Halloween 's " masking " . Murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as I know ! Light viewing , not very scary but a few good jump moments . If it was a choice between The Hole and this though , choose The Hole . Slasher movies have had their day , and this is just another slasher . A very good slasher , but nothing groundbreaking !  
  I rated this film 7/10 which is an average of 8/10 for screenplay , direction and 1944 production values and 6/10 for acting . My acting rating in turn was calculated at 4/10 for all the screen characters except for that played by heroine Ella Raines as Carol Richman who was excellent at 8/10 . Also I commend Thomas Gomez as Inspector Burgess whose character convinces that he personally does not think the guilty verdict on Scott Henderson ( Alan Curtis ) was just in view of his naive alibi . These two then form an alliance to prove Scott 's alibi . I have this film on a " Suevia Film Noir Cine Negro " DVD in Spanish as " La Dama Desconocida " with the original soundtrack " Ingles " as an alternative language , since despite searching I could not find a wholly English version . I was however anxious to see another performance by Ella Raines after being impressed with her performance as a heroine in " Impact " playing a sole female garage proprietor . Here Ella performs another heroic role believing in the innocence of her engineer boss and refuses several suggestions that she should return to her home in Kansas ( her boss 's pet name for her ) before solving the missing alibi . The fact that she is secretly in love with her boss is a little hard to believe since he formally just seemed to have had a formal business relationship with her . He had however designed children 's homes and playgrounds so I suppose " family man " had lit up in Carol 's brain . In the 1940s with " the film code " in operation , producers could only portray sex through metaphors and here it is done in the form of furious drumming played by Elisha Cooke jnr . Carol dolls herself up as a girl of easy virtue in an attempt to lure the drummer into giving her information about " The Phantom Lady " alibi . The other main character , Jack Marlow ( an associate of Scott Henderson ) is played by Franchot Tone whose performance I found too theatrical and wondered why Carol , for instance , did not notice him constantly and strangely admiring his hands . Here the screenplay should have been improved and provided more suspense as these theatrical moves telegraphed the plot far too early to the audience .  
  Damon Runyon 's world of Times Square , in New York , prior to its Disneyfication , is the basis for this musical . Joseph L . Mankiewicz , a man who knew about movies , directed this nostalgic tribute to the " crossroads of the world " that show us that underside of New York of the past . Frank Loesser 's music sounds great . We watch a magnificent cast of characters that were typical of the area . People at the edges of society tended to gravitate toward that area because of the lights , the action , the possibilities in that part of town . This underbelly of the city made a living out of the street life that was so intense . Some of the songs from the original production were not included in the film . We don't know whether this makes sense , but this is not unusual for a Hollywood musical to change and alter what worked on the stage . That original cast included the wonderful Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye , and we wonder about the decision of not letting Robert Alda , Sam Levene , Isabel Bigley repeat their original roles . These were distinguished actors that could have made an amazing contribution . The film , visually , is amazing . The look follows closely the fashions of the times . As far as the casting of Marlon Brando , otherwise not known for his singing abilities , Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons , seem to work in the film . Sky Masterson is , after all , a man 's man , who would look otherwise sissy if he presented a different ' look ' . Frank Sinatra is good as Nathan Detroit . Jean Simmons , as Sarah Brown , does a nice job portraying the woman from the Salvation Army who suddenly finds fulfillment with the same kind of man she is trying to save . Vivian Blaine is a delight . She never ceases to amaze as Miss Adelaide , a woman with a heart of gold who 's Nathan Detroit 's love interest . Ms . Blaine makes a fantastic impression as the show girl who is wiser than she lets out to be . Stubby Kaye makes a wonderful job out of reprising his Nicely Nicely Johnson . The wonderful production owes a lot to the talented Abe Burrows , who made the adaptation to the screen . The costumes by Irene Sharaff set the right tone .  
  Here 's yet another film from the 80 's that most people just don't know exists . This slow , picturesque ( the loving shots of the Montana landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of Costner 's recent " Open Range " , which also starred Robert Duval ) , and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect type of movie to watch late one night when you can't sleep or on a listless Sunday afternoon . Those in the right mood will be treated to a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they come back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son while hunting . The performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced . Glenn Close , Robert Duval , and Wilford Brimley are pitch perfect in their portrayals , as are all the supporting players and young actors . I especially liked how director Cain ( who unfortunately hasn't directed anything of note since this except the first " Young Guns " ) gives us quiet little glimpses into everyone 's personal grief . We don't just see how the death effects the younger brother or the parents , but also the confused middle sister , the wayward uncle , his crazy wife , and the dead teenager 's girlfriend . What we essentially get here is the rural Mid-Western answer to " Ordinary People . " There 's also shades of David Lynch 's " The Straight Story " in some of the stoic downhome Mid-West morality of the folks depicted here and also in the lovingly haunting shots of the farmland they inhabit . This is one of the better and more realistic " tear-jerkers " of the era , and a nice little find for you quality movie hunters out there .  
  " Girlfight " is much more of a coming of age story than it is a fight flick . And what a relief to have one in an urban school , with naturalistic , realistic Latinos and believable use of Brooklyn project settings . It made me realize that virtually all Hollywood high school movies are set in luxurious suburbia or small towns . ( Even the somewhat comparable " Love and Basketball " which focused on teen African-Americans was set in suburbia . ) While these kids share some of the same peer problems , those issues shrink compared to the other struggles of these kids , where high school graduation could be the major accomplishment of their lives . The feminist element here is riveting in its originality , as you hold your breath to see if she can have a relationship-and a victory - on her terms . A lots of audience sympathy goes to the guy who is challenged to rise to a gender-bending-expectations situation . The movie does drag a bit here and there , but this is no cheap thrills " Rocky " fight movie , as the practices and fights have complex outcomes , and all the relationships-especially with fathers and father-figures - take more center stage than the center ring . There were lots of interesting music credits listed at the end , but I hadn't really noticed the songs . ( originally written 10/7/2000 )  
  Girlfight is like your grandmother 's cooking : same old recipe you 've tried a million times before , yet somehow transformed into something fresh and new . Try and explain the story to people who haven't seen it before : a young women from the wrong side of the tracks attempts to improve her situation by taking up boxing whilst dealing with a bitter , obstructive father and her growing attraction to a male rival . Watch them roll their eyes at the string of clichés , and they 're right : it * is * clichéd . Yet I was hypnotized by how well this film works , due to the frequently superb acting and dialogue , and sensitive direction that makes it ' new ' . I avoided this at the cinema because it looked like complete crap but don't make the same mistake I did . Definiately worth a look .  
  I was not expecting the powerful filmmaking experience of " Girlfight " . It 's an Indie ; low-budget , no big-name actors , freshman director . I had heard it was good , but not this good . Placed in a contemporary , ethnic , working-class Brooklyn , Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the day-do-day struggles of urban Latinos . Diana , the protagonist , is seething with anger and lashes out at her high school peers , getting in trouble with the school and her friends . She is being raised by her single father , who appears to love her and her brother , but applies a strict , sex-based double standard on his children . The father 's double standard is illustrated by the fact that Tiny , the brother , is taking boxing lessons at the local gym , but Diana is denied similar pursuits . On an errand to the gym to meet Tiny , Diana is captivated by boxing . Tiny doesn't like boxing , so he and Diana trade places ; he gets the money from Dad then gives it to Diana to take the lessons in his place . This is actually a feel-good movie , as Diana grows and learns about herself through boxing , meets a guy , and addresses some very serious issues head-on . There 's no giggly , ' everything that can go right does go right ' resolution a la " Bend It Like Beckham " . The reality and attendant personal issues are too big for pat resolutions , but in my opinion , " Girlfight " is a better and more satisfying film for it .  
  I love it when they actually do a sports story well . So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch . Not this one . It 's just a genuinely nice movie , an old-fashioned type of story - and based on a real-life guy to did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film . He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out , late in life athletically-speaking , to become a pitcher in professional baseball . Eventually , he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues , even if it was a very brief stint . All the characters in here are nice people , the kind you root for , from Quaid to the players on his high school team , to his little boy ( Angus T . Jones , now somewhat of a star on television . ) Quaid is believable in playing Jim Morris because , unlike actors in the past in sports films , he knows how to throw a baseball . He looks like a pitcher , a guy who could fire it 90-plus miles per hour . And , most of this film is true , as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD . So , if you 're looking for a nice , inspirational true life sports film , you can't wrong with this one .  
  This is a really strange film-and that is NOT a bad thing . It is a combination of a neo-realistic film about the homeless AND a fairy tale . I 'm sure that some may find this movie a bit too strange , but I loved it . Once again , this director brings together a wonderful cast of everyday people ( not actors ) and gets a great ensemble-type performance . Although not nearly as sad as Umberto D , both movies have a very similar point to make-this one just does it in a very absurdist way . Ignore the cheesy special effects-after all , it was made in the early 1950s and special effects aren't terribly important anyway ( or at least they shouldn't be in films ) . Instead , just sit back and enjoy the very strange and silly ride . Unless you are a total curmudgeon , you 'll have a ball . By the way , since I first reviewed this film , I have seen another DeSica directed film that is an absolute must-see and that is THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US . While not a fantasy or light in spirit like MIRACLE IN MILAN , a great film nevertheless .  
  This movie captures the absurd essence of an overbearing American patriot actor - one that believes his work ( and politics ) are as crucial to the American people as the opinions of the President himself . Alan Bates captures this mindset perfectly as Michael Baytes , and I will immortally remember Bates as this character . This is a movie for Canadians and Americans alike . It is a valuable piece of cinema , that which is able to take its audience through the magic of making a film and reveal just how easy it is for the producer and director to lose complete control to the will of the actors and innumerable outside forces . Wonderfully , " Hollywood North " does not suffer from the subject that it portrays : Peter O'Brian directs with precision and complete control , and commands both the serious ' behind-the-scenes ' portion of the movie , and the movie within the movie , " Flight to Bogota " with clarity and insight . If you are at all interested in the wit and strength of Canadian cinema , " Hollywood North " is a great place to start .  
  Another good Stooge short ! Christine McIntyre is so lovely and evil and the same time in this one ! She is such a great actress ! The Stooges are very good and especially Shemp and Larry ! This to is a good one to watch around Autumn time !  
  Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971 . At this point , America knows they are fighting a loosing battle , and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the ' Tigerland ' training camp in Louisiana . The film is more of a character study no real plot , but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz , who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man , who only wants to escape the camp . We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold . I 'd have to say this is a great story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general .. Great acting , and very memorable . Also the directors use of film and style works so well , cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam . Its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle . The particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell .. and it 's futility . Fantastic film . Not just about Nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being ' in the army ' . Rating 9 out of 10 .  
  Never heard of this movie , saw it on DVD . Great movie , perfect example of a movie that took every cast member to make it work . No overhyped typical Hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors . No current Quote " A " list actor could have pulled off any performance in this movie . Brought back memories of my own post Vietnam war military experiences . It concentrated on the people who were sent to fight . As was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service . They were regular people too , some just weren't cut out for military life , I remember a few in my experience-to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either-but I 'll never forget them-should have stayed in touch . I highly recommend it and then think about those serving present day in Afganistan . Basic training is a trip , notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need " sensitivity training " HA ! HA ! HA !  
  Producer Joel Schumacher who also directed " Phone Booth " , ' 02 , and many other great films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into COMBAT ! Colin Farrell ( Roland Bozz ) , " Intermission " , ' 03 , gave one of his best performances and actually carried this entire picture on his back . Matthew Davis ( Jim Paxton ) , " Blue Crush " , ' 02 , gave a great supporting role and Shea Whigham ( Pvt . Wilson ) , " All The Real Girls " , ' 03 , showed his true acting skills in the role that he played . There was two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires . One Army Veteran instructor from Viet Nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body . Enjoyable and entertaining film to view .  
  As with a bunch of guys at school we must give this a thumbs up . Even the Grim Ripper made us smile . Those two alien things made me laugh , Bill and Ted were the stupidest yet the funnest in the entire movie . This is a lot better than the first one . And yet for some reason I feel that it misses something . Something big . Something important . Made a better house and girlfriends . No , I 'd say better villains . Use clones instead of robots . I gave this a 7 out of 10 because of those two robotic doinks . The Grim Ripper , don't be scared he 's not the deathy kind , is funny . When he fell from the sky I split a gut . Splat , I 'm not sure about those aliens . What where they ? Scientists ? No way .  
  I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about - this was a wonderful movie , and created a sense of the era that feels like time travel . The characters are truly young , Mary is a strong match for Byron , Claire is juvenile and a tad annoying , Polidori is a convincing beaten-down sycophant .. all are beautiful , curious , and decadent .. not the frightening wrecks they are in Gothic . Gothic works as an independent piece of shock film , and I loved it for different reasons , but this works like a Merchant and Ivory film , and was from my readings the best capture of what the summer must have felt like . Romantic , yes , but completely rekindles my interest in the lives of Shelley and Byron every time I think about the film . One of my all-time favorites .  
  The film version of Alice Walker 's hugely emotive and influential 1983 novel ( written largely as letters from the central character Celie to God ) was a massive Oscar success , and rightly so . In the role of the abused and awakened Celie , Whoopi Goldberg gave her best screen performance by miles . Not far behind her was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia , the fiery woman tamed by fate . Others in the cast fleshed out the characters Walker had introduced so clearly on the page - Danny Glover as Albert , Celie 's abusive husband ; Margaret Avery as Shug , a force of change for the good ; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak ; Susan Beaubian as Corrine , the preacher 's wife ; and the much-missed Carl Anderson ( otherwise best known as Judas in the 1973 film of Jesus Christ Superstar ) as preacher Samuel . Beautifully paced and sensitively written , ' The Color Purple ' does justice to its source while opening out the story to involve viewers of a feature-length drama .  
  This is the last Dutch language film Paul Verhoeven made before going on to make mainstream Hollywood films " Basic Instinct , " " Robocop , " and " Total Recall , " among others . He sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey in her web before we meet Gerard Reve , an annoying self-centered writer with a morbid imagination . Gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a Literary Club meeting in sea-side town an hour or so from Amsterdam . Verhoeven lets us have glimpses of how Gerard 's imagination twists reality . Asked if writers are a bit close to insanity he admits when he reads the newspaper " and it says ' boom ' I read ' doom , ' when it says ' flood ' I read ' blood , ' when it says ' red ' I see ' dead . ' " When he tells a story enough times he begins to believe it ; " I lie the truth . " He accepts an offer to be the overnight guest of the Club treasurer , a beautiful wealthy salon owner . As he gets to know her and learns her husband has died , he begins to imagine she is ' a black widow . ' Is this his more of his reality twist or is she a murderess ? This is a psychological drama and in recounting which of these old films have stuck in my memory , I figured out is my favorite gender . Looking at his body of work it is seems to be Paul Verhoeven 's too , and he is a master in making us question our own understanding of reality . It 's a nice change of pace from the usual Hollywood fare . I saw it in 1983 and it is a film that " stuck . "  
  This is an excellent stand-up DVD ! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I have seen in years . His routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it . I HIGHLY recommend this one . The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow , but the ending jokes in French are quite good , because you don't have to speak French to get it ( although if you do , it is still hilarious ) . Also , the parts about being a transvestite are quite good . The first scene ( about San Francisco ) is not great , but funny the first time . Skip over those if you can . It 's almost not worth watching . However , this really is a funny , funny stand-up show that everyone should see . " I was dead at the time ! "  
  The basic hook here is : Lincoln Is Slow . It is his slowness that represents his thoughtfulness and deliberation , making him a Great Leader who is here engaged in single-handedly civilizing the American frontier through the grand instrument of Law . All that John Ford hooey and more , including one lurking slave and extraneous Death By Injun . However ! The ' slow ' conceit is also at the center of one brilliant piece of movie-making , funny and moving at extremes . The history may be bunk , but the telling of it suggests a view of history as process that inspires some excitingly true-seeming moments . Check out Henry Fonda 's big introductory stroll across the deck , his shockingly beautiful second visit with his girl by the river , his dalliance with Mary Todd on the porch , and the priceless business that follows ' Ma'am , we 've got to hurry ! ' Things do thin out once we settle into the big courtroom drama ; but Fonda is priceless throughout .  
  The film as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart is excellent as Chip Hardesty , with well done co-starring turns by Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton . But the film , directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy , was constantly vetted and script approval as well as every aspect of the film , down to clothing , was closely watched and controlled by J . Edgar Hoover . Not that J . Edgar Hoover didn't have something to be proud of . His management of the bureau from 1924 to his death crated on of the finest investigative services in the world . But by 1959 Hoover was already beginning to worry about being forced out and had already started to collect dossiers on powerful people to make sure and protect his little kingdom . And he was determined to make sure that no motion picture showed even a single wart about the bureau . The films shows only continued successes and glosses over the failures which occurred , and the bureau 's part in the witch hunts of the early 1950 's . Enjoy the story , but with tongue firmly in cheek .  
  Good luck finding this film to even watch - it 's not yet released on tape or DVD . I saw on release in the early ' 70 's , was lucky enough to catch it via American Cinematheque 's preservation efforts , and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years . No reason to repeat rwint 's accurate comments here . As a come-out Director soon after the soaring success of Five Easy Pieces , Jack N has been said to have managed the low budget effort as best as possible , and it certainly shows in the wandering and meandering that could have used some re-cutting . But it 's also a memorable icon for it 's time : the all very intense clashes of late 60 's college sports , student movements , sexual revolution , and more . Why see this film ? It was probably a ground breaker in some scenes : the frisky male bonding in the after-game showers ; Karen Black 's scene with Tepper in the car will catch you a little off guard - but it 's the first use of a word I hadn't witnessed in film before ; and the casual and unexpected use of nudity overall . There are probably others I 'm omitting . Look for a nice surprise of a young Cindy Williams in one of her first films ; a thin David Ogend Stiers ; Mike Warren fresh out of his powder-blue UCLA uniform and readying for a dark-blue TV uniform ; Robert Towne - Actor ; and a whole lot of folks simply playing themselves . Now : any connection between Harry Gittes last name , Robert Towne , and a certain character in Chinatown and the Two Jakes ? It gets a " 7 " based on Karen Black . You 'll see why .  
  It is an almost ideal romantic anime ! MUST SEE FOR ALL AGES ! But the English dubbed version is not too good . Perhaps the 1999 version will be better .  
  I first saw this film when I was about seven years old and was completely enchanted by it then but for years was unable to find out what the film was called . now i am twenty one and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy . although my memory of the film was a little hazy I was in no way disappointed by what I saw . the animation in this film is superb conjuring up an entire world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn in to the film by that alone . But this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike . with a floating island , a mad general , a friendly pirate granny and a well constructed love story this film will not let you down I would recommend this film to any one .  
  This is one of the best animated family films of all time . Moreover , virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli . Specifically , other great films include " My Neighbor Totoro " and " Kikki 's Delivery Service . " Spirited Away is quite good , but a bit too creepy for typical family fare - better for teenagers and adult . The one thing that sets " Laputa : Castle in the Sky " apart from other films by Miyazaki is that it is far more of a tension-filled adventure ride . Why is this film so good ? Because it 's a complete package : the animation is very well done , and the story is truly engaging and compelling . Most Japanese anime is imaginative , but decidedly dark or cynical or violent ; and the animation itself is often jerky , stylized , and juvenile . None of these problems plague Castle in the Sky . It has imagination to burn , and the characters are well drawn , if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people . ( None of those trench-coat wearing posers ) There is plenty of adventure , but not blood and gore . The animation is smooth , detailed , and cinematic ally composed - not a lot of flat shots . The backgrounds are wonderful . The voice acting in the dubbed English version is first rate , particularly the two leads , Pazo ( James Van der Beek ) and Sheeta ( Anna Paquin ) . The sound engineering is great , too . Use your studio sound , if you 've got it . One aspect that I particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained . Laputa was once inhabited , and is now abandoned . Why ? We never know . We know as much as we need to know , and then we just have to accept the rest , which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized . Indeed , it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters , who are for the most part one-dimensional stock characters ( e . g . , gruff general , silly sidekick , kooky old miner , etc . ) Highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60 !  
  For anyone who has only seen Disney Productions beautifully animated version of ' Beauty & The Beast ' , or even Jean Cocteau 's surreal fairy tale vision will be quite taken aback by this 1975 French ( but with a director from Poland ) version . The plot concerns a French family of fading aristocracy that is marrying into a well to do English family . The major catch is that the bridegroom is carrying an ancient curse on the family . The film also includes many flashback sequences ( potentially ) explaining this family curse . From the opening credits , to the very end , it 's a nearly non stop erotic fun house ride , with some VERY explicit & graphic sexual content ( hence the film 's X rating in the U.S. in it 's initial run , which is now unrated ) . The film 's somewhat contemptuous sentiment at the ruling class will probably remind one of Bunuel 's flights into similar territory . If you have a taste for the truly bizarre , and are not offended by " taboo " material , then this film may just scratch that itch for you .  
  Now my friends , films like " La Bête " ( aka " The Beast " or " O Monstro " ) only can be done in the old continent : ) , in this film we see all : horses dirty sex , nymphomaniac kind off gorilla , non sense dialogs , etc , etc , etc .. In the serious terms now , its an allegory , that men sometimes could be bestial , visceral and brutal , Walerian Borowczyk ( the director ) shows us the loss of innocence , sexual violence , rape and brutality . Its a astonishing cinematic experience , bizarre and full of grotesque scenes . For all fans of European shocking exploitation , i recommend this film . If you like this one i recommend : " Orloff Against the Invisible Man " and " Alterated States " .  
  It helps if you understand Czech and can see this in the original language and understand the Czechs obsession with ' The Professionals ' , but if not , ' Jedna ruka netlaska ' is yet another great Czech film . It is funny , dark and extremely enjoyable . The highest compliment I can pay it is that you never know quite what is going to happen next and even keep that feeling well into the second and third viewing . For a small country the Czech Republic has produced an amazing amount of world class film and literature , from Hrabal , Hasek and Kundera to the films of Menzel , Sverak and numerous others . Czech humour by its very nature is dark and often uncompromising , but often with a naive and warm sentiment behind it . This film is just that , it is unkind and deals with the less lovable sides of human beings , but underneath it all there is a beautiful story full of promise , good intent and optimism . I highly recommend this and most other projects Trojan and Machacek are involved in . Enjoy it , it 's a film made for just that reason - anyway , it 's as close as the Czechs will ever come to writing a truly happy ending ..  
  I have become quite fond of Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks , and was thrilled when I discovered this gem . I have always found it wonderful when I run across a film where I do not have to have my finger on the remote control in case nudity rears its ugly head . The Divorce of Lady X is charming till the final scene , and must have been a true delight for viewers back in 1938 . I only wish people today could accept and love true humor instead of the horrid trash talk people now call funny . The Divorce of Lady X is well worth anyone 's time .  
  No , I 'm not joking around . If you ever , EVER , have the chance to see this movie see it . If you need chop off your arm to see it , see it . It 's worth it . Fatty Drives The Bus is unlike any film you 've ever seen . It takes trash cinema and elevates it to a work of art . While it contains poor shots , idiotic characters , bad dialogue , strange acting , and cinematography that belongs on public access in Iowa , it actually succeeds in its goal as a film . It strives to be the dumbest , strangest , most inane movie you 've ever seen . And boy does it ever succeed . I will lay out the plot for those of you who worry about such things ( the filmmakers obviously didn't ) , but really you needn't pay too much attention because the entire film 's plot is presented in a very long piece of text played before the opening credits . In any event , FDTB ( as its admirers call it ) is the story of a bus tour through Chicago , which is led by Satan . You see , Jesus is in town , and all the passengers on the bus are supposed to die , and all their souls would have gone to hell , except with Jesus in town , a lackey in hell calls off the job , and this angers Satan because , well he doesn't like looking like a fool in front of the guy , so he decides to get the people on the bus to sign over their souls to him directly , but he 's a devil , so he needs to disguise himself , otherwise , who 'd go on a tour with him right , so he disguises himself as Roger and he gets on the bus , where the driver is never referred to by name , but he is kind of fat , so I guess he 's Fatty . The bus ( and the riders ) are on a collision course with wackiness ! Examples of some lunacy : The title repeats on the screen 3 times . I don't know why . A character appears on the bus in mid-trip without explanation or introduction , and occassionally sits next to the others , and they look at her like she doesn't belong . I don't know why . Two characters fall in love and exchange longing glances , that are really the same shots repeated over and over again . I don't know why . After Satan gives a minute long monologue about transforming into human form a title card flashes " Satan is going to transform . " I don't know why . One character is a woman who is very obviously a man in drag , and is referred to by other characters as " the glamorous Bridget . " I don't know why . If there was one good thing that came out of my internship at Troma last summer it was getting my own copy of Fatty Drives The Bus .  
  What can I say ? An action and allegorical tale which has just about everything . Basically a coming of age tale about a young boy who is thrust into a position of having to save the world .. and more . He meets a dazzling array of heroes and villains , and has quite a time telling them apart . A definite must-see .  
  The only thing about this film that bums me out is that the DVD is so expensive . It 's too much for my budget at the moment , or I would purchase it , because the film is a good example of film noir .. and I enjoy watching Richard Widmark , Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter . Criterion produces great DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much . That 's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white , mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary , cinematography-wise . The story is the story here ( as opposed to visuals , actors , sound , sets , etc . ) as a pickpocket ( Widmark ) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters ' purse . ( say that three times ! ) . Everyone but Peters is a believable character in this movie : Widmark , the cops , the U.S. agents and the Communists and , especially Ritter as " Moe , " an informant . She and Widmark are the stars of this film . Peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by " falling in love " with Widmark on the first meeting even though he 's nasty to her . Only in world of film ! Too bad , because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it . This an average film noir which means good , but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $ 25-$35 . For that price , one could do a lot better in the film noir market .  
  and anyone who watches this film will agree . This film was directed in the days when plot , character believability and theme actually mattered . Jean Peters , Widmark , and Thelma Ritter steal the spotlight . Ritter is in top form as informer " Moe " she survives in the Bowery section of NY , acting as a stool pigeon for NYC police . The only other film in which I have seen Peters is " Niagara " , and she certainly proves her acting ability here , complete with Brooklyn accent . Widmark is appropriately menacing , as the anti-hero who must discern what the right thing is , despite his need for cash . The photography is brilliant . The neon , the subway station ( though it looks cleaner than the real thing ! ) the harbor shack where Widmark lives as a transient . Excellent use is made of the city , with " Lightning Louie " in Chinatown ; the many flavors and appetites of the city are addressed here ; the political climate of the time is a haunting backdrop . 10/10 .  
  " Pickup On South Street " is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself embroiled in the activities of a group of communists . The action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing . The use of a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close-ups also contribute to the overall impression of constant motion and vitality . Samuel Fuller 's style of directing and the cinematography by Joseph MacDonald are excellent and there are many scenes which through their composition and lighting produce a strong sense of mood and atmosphere . Ace pickpocket and repeat offender Skip McCoy ( Richard Widmark ) gets into deep water when he steals a wallet from a young woman named Candy ( Jean Peters ) on the New York subway . She was being used by her ex-boyfriend Joey ( Richard Kiley ) to make a delivery to one of his contacts in a communist organisation and unknown to her , she was carrying US Government secrets recorded on microfilm . Two FBI agents had been following Candy and witnessed the theft . One of the agents continues to tail her back to Joey 's apartment and the other , Zara ( Willis Bouchey ) , visits Police Captain Dan Tiger ( Murvyn Vye ) . Zara explains that the FBI has been following Candy for some months as part of their pursuit of the ringleader of a communist group . In order to identify the pickpocket , Tiger calls in a " stoolie " called Moe ( Thelma Ritter ) who after being given a precise description of the " cannon 's " method of working makes a list of eight possible suspects . Once Tiger sees Skip 's name on the list he 's immediately convinced that he 's the man that they need to track down and he sends two detectives to arrest him . When Skip is brought into Tiger 's office , Zara tells him about the microfilm and Tiger offers to drop any charges if he 'll co-operate with the investigation . Skip is flippant and arrogant . He clearly doesn't trust Tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft on the subway . Joey orders Candy to find out who stole the microfilm and then retrieve it . Candy pays Moe for Skip 's address and when Skip returns from being questioned by Tiger , he finds Candy searching his home and knocks her unconscious before stealing her money . When she recovers , Skip demands payment of $ 25,000 for the microfilm . She tells Joey about Skip 's demand and Joey 's boss gives him a gun and orders him to recover the microfilm by the following evening . Skip and Candy are attracted to each other and it 's because of their uneasy , developing relationship that a means evolves by which they are able to shake off the attentions of the police . It soon becomes apparent , however , that resolving matters with the communist gang will only be achieved by more direct action . The depictions of Skip , Candy and Moe as characters that inhabit a seedy world in which they are forced to face considerable risks on a daily basis are powerful and compelling . Moe 's work as a police informer is dependent on her knowledge of the people in her community but also those people know what she does and any one of them could seek their revenge at any time . She appears to be cunning and streetwise but also has her vulnerable side as she describes herself as " an old clock running down " and saves money to be able to have a decent burial in an exclusive cemetery in Long Island . Her belief that " every buck has a meaning of its own " leads her to sell any information regardless of danger , friendships or principles and yet there is one occasion where she refuses and this proves fatal . Thelma Ritter 's performance certainly merited the Oscar nomination she earned for her role . Skip is a violent criminal with no concern for his victims and having already been convicted three times in the past , lives under the constant threat of being jailed for life if convicted again . Despite this , he still continues with his criminal activities and strangely , is merely philosophical when Moe betrays his whereabouts and then later , he even ensures that Moe receives the type of burial she valued so highly . Candy is an ex-hooker and someone whose activities constantly put her in peril but behind her hardened exterior a warmer side gradually becomes more evident . Widmark and Peters are both perfect for their roles and like Ritter portray the different facets of their personalities with great style and conviction .  
  This movie is one of the funniest , saddest and most accurate portrayals of the mentality that seems to have pervaded the Balkans yet again , 45 years after the time depicted . All the usual characters and conflicts are presented with such anger , sadness and love combined that it is impossible to decide whether crying or laughing would be the more appropriate response . The accuracy of portrayal and the timelessness of the types , however , make it for a great film to watch if one wants to understand a little bit of what drove ex-Yugoslavia to its madness . In fact , no diplomat dealing with the region should attempt anything until they saw this movie , and its twin , * Maratonci trce pocasni krug . * Did I mention it is one of the funniest movies I 've ever seen ?  
  I saw this film ( it 's English title is " Who 's Singing Over There ? " ) at the 1980 Montreal International Film Festival . It won raves then .. and disappeared . A terrible shame . It is brilliant . Sublime , ridiculous , sad , and extremely funny . The script is a work of art . It 's been 19 years and I 've seen only a handful of comedies ( or any other genre , for that matter ) that can match its originality .  
  At your video store , you might find this gem . The human condition in modern times LA . No exaggerated drama , just a collapsing of events that might happen to any group of individuals over time . Helps you understand the joys and desperation of urban life . The direction and cutting are top class . Cinematography and music very much follows the mood and situation . And the CAST ! Excellent casting and excellent acting . No one out of place or out of character . And it 's NOT really as much a downer as you would expect . I gave it 7 of 10 . If you havent seen it , DO !  
  Who wouldn't want to go on road trip with Peter Falk ? That guy 's right eye has more character than most actors today . This is the kind of funny and touching movie we are all looking for as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects bores . Women are going to love it for all the wake-up romance advice for men , and men will love it for its spot-on father / son character study-one great little scene after another . And it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find . Obviously this is a labor of love for Paul Reiser who understands what it 's like to be both a father and a son , as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life . The most fun part , though , was watching Reiser watch Falk . You could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really enjoying Peter Falk 's special craft . Really delightful . Let 's hope this film makes it into theaters around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and folks .  
  I won't go into too much detail about the plot of this movie as other reviewers have covered pretty much the same ground . Just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the film very much . Peter Falk 's performance alone is reason enough to watch the film . A small scale ' road trip ' movie with Falk & Paul Reiser in upstate NY in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the film . Very well written with an adult target audience in mind . Plenty of reality based humor & some well played drama give the film a feeling that it could be your own family . Really can't say enough about this film except that it 's a damn shame that a lovely movie like this doesn't get more exposure while other trashy junk out there does . It 's great to see Falk with a big leading man role again & he makes the most of it . It proves that his famous friend & writer / director John Casavettes was right in casting Falk in many of his ground breaking films of the 60s & 70s .  
  I first saw Rob Roy twelve years ago . With little money for entertainment , I rented it for my fiancé and I to watch on a bone chilling winter 's night . The movie I had wanted was gone , so I rented this instead , not expecting much , and was very much surprised with how good it was . I just recently watched it again , and loved it every bit as much as the first time . For those unfamiliar with the story , it 's about Scottish outlaw Robert Roy MacGregor , a cattleman and folk hero . From the little I know about the man and his story , liberties have been taken with the facts , but it 's a movie , not a textbook , and so the filmmakers can be excused . Basically , the plot of the movie is that Rob Roy borrows money from the Marquis of Montrose to buy cattle which he then intends to sell and reap a large profit from . But , his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest . Our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the Marquis , and Mary , his wife , suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of Archibald Cunningham , a smarmy Englishman with no soul . Atrocities ensue , until , in an immensely satisfying conclusion , Rob carves Archibald up like a Christmas turkey . There are many great performances in this movie , but allow me to touch specifically on a few . Liam Neeson , as usual , is fantastic , a sexy beast you can't take your eyes off of . Honestly , this man is like ice cream : even when he 's bad he 's good . His Rob Roy is an honourable man struggling to provide for those who depend on him , in the best way he knows how . Jessica Lange , as Mary , gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering , dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure . You just know she doesn't take any b . s from Rob , or anyone else for that matter . Tim Roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil Archibald , yet somehow , it works . All the posturing and preening , combined with some wicked dialogue , result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory . Combine all of this , and the stellar work by other supporting players , with the luscious scenery of Scotland , and you have what amounts to one really , really cool movie . If you haven't seen this , I highly recommend that you do .  
  Rob Roy is and underrated epic of passion and action ! SOME MILD SPOILERS WITHIN . Liam Neeson gives a towering performance as Rob Roy MacGregor , one of the best in his career . Jessica Lange is letter-perfect as his wife Mary . They have the most passion and chemistry I 've seen in a screen couple . John Hurt gives his best snotty aristocrat performance . Tim Roth portrays one of the great screen villains . His rape of Mary is repugnant and harrowing . He really is a magnificent bastard in this movie . The final duel between Rob and Cunningham is one of the best swordfights ever . Well scripted ans scored , and Michael Caton-Jones direction is flawless . 10 out of 10 .  
  So , neighbor was killing neighbor . Reminds me of Iraq . As I watched the American flag ( 50 stars in 1864 ? ) being dragged behind the horse , I realized why burning that piece of red white and blue doesn't upset me as much as our destruction / indifference to the Bill of Rights . I 'm a Southerner , and must have some historical memory . Watching the Tobey McGuire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave , as he looks at the scalps of blacks and Germans ( his ethnic background ) being wagered at a poker game .. was interesting . Many twists in this movie . The wife , who is forced into her marriage , shows both lust and a strong will , characteristics we 're not used to seeing in ' respectable Victorian southern belles ' . The crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin , head of the Copeland Horse-thieving Gang , Inc . in Mississippi , was hung about that time . Bands of homeless men were roaming the countryside , armed . Remind you of Iraq ? And how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background ? And why southerners are STILL fighting that civil war today . Too bad we can't use that same knowledge in our handling of the country we 've just invaded and are occupying , fomenting civil war everywhere . That 's Mesopotamia , now called Iraq , who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil . The wild-eyed killers in Missouri , raiding Lawrence , Kansas could as easily be the insurgents we 're fighting now with no success . Another anomaly was the father 's tribute to the Yankees who move into Lawrence and erect a school " even before they erect a church . And for that reason , they 'll win . " Huh ? I was taught history in Birmingham , Al and we were taught that the North was much more industrial and richer .. that 's why they won . Course , they also LITERALLY had God on their side . As you see here , when the freed slave indicates that he 's cutting out to free his mother , sold into slavery in Texas . God , what a horrible legacy slavery gave us . Acting pretty good , lots of blood and gore as the warriors ride gleefully into battle ( but didn't hear any rebel yells , so reminiscent of football games in Alabama ) . You also get a real feeling for how stupid the war was , as the bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their forces for another raid . They have lost sight of why they 're fighting , and so do we . Just more mindless slaughter . You 're also brought up to date with the limbless kids coming home from Iraq , as the bushwacker ( ahh , what connotations ) first has his arm seared shut , trying to save it , then has it amputated , and then dies . So much suffering for such a stupid cause . The cinematography is fantastic . Now I have to get back to the DVD and get the production notes , one of my favorite parts of any movie . I suspect that this movie was written by a Gore Vidal , as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era , if you knew History . The dialogue is definitely thought-provoking . Not your ordinary blood and guts war movie , by any means . You see the wounded but still active-duty soldiers , still fighting cause they have nothing else to do . You see the southern raiders , living off the land , stealing indiscriminately . Yet , at the beginning , you 've seen the battle stop , so the women could be evacuated from danger . As I read the escalating number of women and children dying in Iraq , I 'm thinking , " Where did we lose our sense of honor as a people ? " I have forgotten why I sought this movie out and bought it after 20 years , but some book somewhere lauded it . With good reason . Tobey at his best , pre-Spideyman . Buy the DVD or rent it . And tell me why others laud this , not just liberals cest moi .  
  Yes , I call this a perfect movie . Not one boring second , a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors , a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives I could sympathize with , perfect lighting , crisp black and white photography , a fitting soundtrack , an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works . It 's one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of Hollywood should rest , the mark everyone should endeavor to reach . Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning . There was nothing this actress couldn't do , and she always went easy on the melodramatic side . No hysterical outbursts with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford , and this movie confirmed my opinion . Always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments . It is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career , and this one is by far the least interesting . The title fits this movie very well . It is about desires , human desires I think everyone can understand . Actually , no one seems to be scheming in this movie , all characters act on impulse , everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else . The sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which I will not go here . I liked what this movie has to say about youth , about maturing and about the necessity to compromise . The movie I associate most with this one is Alfred Hitchcock 's Shadow of a Doubt , it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured Small Town America . The story has a certain similarity with Fritz Lang 's considerably harsher movie Clash by Night , made one year earlier , where Stanywck stars in a similar part . I can also recommend it .  
  This is one of the best movies . It is one of my favorites . A movie with good acting . The story is very sensitive and touching . Good camera work also . The names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the American Star list . However , they give equal or better performances than the top of the list . It is such a pleasure to see a movie about true love , romance , friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kick-box their way to save the world . If you don't like this movie then you have no heart or feelings . Then go watch a sports movie . There is no killing or horror here . See the movie . It is a must . TH  
  In the Citadel film series book The Films of Gene Kelly , Anchors Aweigh is described as a kingpin of a musical . I sure can't do better than that . It 's such an important film in both the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra . Kathryn Grayson didn't do too badly with this either . Louis B . Mayer had lent Gene Kelly out to Columbia where Harry Cohn had an inspiration to let Kelly choreograph his own numbers and because of it , Cover Girl became a classic . So if Mayer didn't learn a lesson , producer Joe Pasternak did and allowed Kelly artistic control . When Anchors Aweigh was finished , Fred Astaire at last had a dancing rival for monarch of cinema dance . The main number everyone talks about with Gene Kelly here is the dance with Jerry Mouse . Originally Kelly wanted to do the number with Walt Disney 's Mickey Mouse , but Disney wasn't lending Mickey out to nobody . Mickey would have to wait until Who Framed Roger Rabbit to do an outside film . Not to worry because MGM had it 's own animated rodent one half the team of Tom and Jerry . Kelly as dancer always strived to do something new and different on screen as did Fred Astaire . For the next dozen years , these two were allowed all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work even if the films themselves weren't up to snuff . It was like each inspired the other to bigger and better creativity , Kelly for MGM , Astaire for MGM and any number of other studios . In Anchors Aweigh , Kelly got Sinatra to dance a bit . In fact Frank Sinatra always gave credit to Gene Kelly for showing him how musicals should be done as he gave credit to both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift for their help in earning him is Oscar for From Here to Eternity . When Frank Sinatra had half of his contract bought from RKO by MGM he insisted on a little artistic creativity on his own . He 'd become friends with the songwriting team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn . In his autobiography Sammy Cahn tells about how Sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film . Louis B . Mayer gave in and the team wrote some really fine ballads for him to sing . One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh , I Fall in Love Too Easily . Frank sings it accompanying himself on the piano at an empty Hollywood Bowl . It 's Sinatra at his best . With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen , Sammy Cahn richly earned the title of having put more song lyrics in Frank Sinatra 's mouth than any other person . They were lifetime friends and Cahn always credited Sinatra with this milestone boost in his career . On a bet Styne and Cahn said they could write a song just using a chromatic scale . They proved it in Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson put her soprano to work on All of a Sudden My Heart Sings . She also did some classical numbers . Here singing in fact is the basis of the plot . Two sailors on leave through a combination of circumstances meet up with Kathryn Grayson and her orphaned nephew Dean Stockwell . Trying to fix her up with Sinatra , Kelly says he can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi . They spend the film trying to accomplish just that . My only disappointment in Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton , who plays the waitress ' Brooklyn ' never got a number herself . She had gotten rave reviews from her performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and that 's what brought her to Hollywood . I have a suspicion she had a number that was cut and somewhere in MGM 's vaults it might still be . Anchors Aweigh is a great example of why musicals just aren't made any more . All that creative talent was under contract to Metro-Goldwyn - Mayer . If you had to pay market value for it , the cost might retire some third world country 's debt . But the film results would be extraordinary .  
  I saw this movie today and I have to say , it was much much better than I expected it to be about couple of hours before going to see it . Personally I had some prejudice due to the language of it , but it did totally change my idea . The movie was in most cases surprisingly good with the great actor and actress performances . It was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it . This really touched me and as a film , which is based on a true story , it convinced me . A new school , psycho headmaster and a young boy who get known with a new teacher , a bit different one than the others and about fighting for the things even if they doesn't seem to work out . It showed how little things can make huge changes in many things , and how difference can sometimes cause difficult situations . Also I think the actor selections has succeeded perfectly . It really felt like you had been some person watching the episodes as an outsider when they happened . Before I spoil this movie with praises , I have to admit that there were some things and situations that didn't look and feel realistic .. like the one where the headmaster of the school beat Frits aka . Martin in front of the class , at the end of the movie . He really got beaten badly , but the only thing that it caused to him , was some blood coming from the nose when comparing that to the first beating in the beginning , when Frits got some stitches .. well I guess every movie has it own faults .. have to say , that if I someday somewhere find this DVD from the store , it 's sure thing , that I take it with me .  
  This movie stars Jay Leno as a Detroit cop , Tony Costas and Pat Morita as a Tokyo cop sent to Detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype of a car motor . A Japanese man traveled to Detroit hoping to sell it to a up and coming car company ran by a man named Derrick Jarryd . Unfortunately for him the men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype . An angry Derek Jarryd tries to distance himself from Phillip Madras who led the men . But Madras ( played by Chris Sarandon ) has none of it and threatens Jarryd forcing him to continue their partnership . Meanwhile in the same junk yard where the Japanese man had been killed , a friend of Tony Costas was also killed by the same men . Tony 's friend had been watching the junk yard . Tony sets out to find the killer against his superior 's order . Tony is on robbery while obviously homicide should investigate the case . While Tony is investigating the crime he runs into the Japanese cop and mistakingly he arrests him . Eventually they end up working together on the case . They make an odd pair and there are some genuinely amusing parts as well as some ridiculous scenes such as Pat Morita jumping and kicking right through a the windshield of a moving car and kicking Madras in the head . But it ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie , at least in my opinion . Jay Leno is no actor , but he is likable in the role and Pat Morita is good as well . Still , they make for one of the more unlikely buddy cop duos in an action film . If you liked buddy cop films , cheesy 80 's movies or you want to see Jay Leno as an actor then I recommend this movie .  
  This could be a 10 if it wasn't for the quite predictable and hollywood-ish scenario . Daniel Day-Lewis confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time ( why not THE leading may I ask ) and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level . I personally was impressed with Hugh O ' Connor who played Christy Brown as a child . The very first scene I watched him was really strong . Wow .  
  My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy . in her 22 years of life , she has seen nothing but the walls of our house and her school which is also occupied with other disabled kids . i have been the butt of everyone 's jokes because my sister is disabled , and i still think to this day that nobody is , or ever will give a damn about her and her condition . Then i saw this film . I knew what Christy 's family was going through . but they were lucky . Christy could talk , he could communicate , and he had artistic skills . my sister can walk , but she can't utter a word , and she can't use her hands to do anything but grab onto things . but this film made me realize there were other people in the world like my sister , and the ending ( to tell the truth ) made me cry . AND I 'VE SEEN SHAWSHANK ! This film is seriously underrated , and it shouldn't . This movie tells people something . that people should be proud of their own lives . thinking you can't write well ? this guy wrote with his foot . thinking you 're not attractive ? this guy got turned down by lots of girls , because of his condition . not the fastest runner ? christy couldn't even stand up . My point : Parents of young children , i suggest your children watch this movie with you , so they 'll know the next time they see someone on the street in a wheelchair , they don't stare at them like they 're aliens . My sister got millions of stares , and it breaks my heart to think that this is still happening to many people . This film will teach people , that people who might not seem " normal " are people too . 10/10  
  Jackie Chan 's Police Story is a landmark film for both the Honk Kong action genre and the career of Jackie Chan . Directed / written by Chan , Police Story has a basic plot as did all the films of that era and genre , and like most of the the films of Police Storys ' kind , the script is nothing to be raved about . But the plot of the film is Jackie Chan , who plays a nice guy cop , struggling to convict the local gang lord . The direction of the film is nothing special and by no means the best directing effort that Jackie Chan has given us , that responsibility falls to the underrated masterpiece " Miracles " . However the job that Jackie does directing is sufficient and respectable . The standout out directing of the film comes with the fight scenes . The performances in this film also vary with Jackie giving a very solid typical Chan nice guy up against it role , but this is by no means his best acting role , that can been seen in the Sammo Hung directed film " Heart of the Dragon " . The other actors in the film also give as good a solid performance as Jackie with Bridgete Lin playing her part of the unwilling witness reasonably well , but neither does she display full acting potential . The standout acting comes from Maggie Cheung as Jackies ' suffering girlfriend and Bill Tung as the sympathetic and funny police chief . None of the performances in this film is of a low enough standard to affect the quality of the film . The action in the film is what really separates this film from others with stunning contemporary choreography to suit the urbanised , modern setting , the action is some some of the greatest fight scenes ever put on camera . To begin with there is a shootout in the slum where Koo ( ganglord ) is making a drug deal , whilst being no John Woo style sequence , this serves as a nice starter for the film . This is then followed by the famous car run down the side of the hill and through the heart of the slum wrecking everything in sight . This is a breathtaking sequence that has since been shamelessly copied by Bad Boys 2 . In the middle of the film is yet another standout sequence as Jackie tries to transport Bridgete Lin from her house to his . This is really the first scene where we get to see the awesome fast paced hand to hand combat that has since become the norm for all modern set martial art films . This sequence is fantastically choreographed , timed and seamlessly edited together to maximise the brutality of the scene . However , as tradition dictates , the standout fight sequence is at the end of the film . This sequence displays some of Chans ' best choreography , stunts and camera / editing work . This sequence is now famous for two things , the amount of people sent through high density glass , which has to be said a phenomenal amount of people , and the stunt at the end where Jackie leaps from a 5th storey balcony , grabs hold of a pole and slides down through a glass roof ( this has to be seen to be believed ) . Whilst the two for-mentioned factors are both uniquely brilliant , i think that the most impressive part of this fight sequence is Chans ' ability to incorporate anything into the fight sequence and the sheer originality of the choreography , that for me has never been bettered . I also believe that the action in Police Story is some of the best filmed and edited action of Chans career helping to set the action apart from others . Overall , Police Story , despite its unspectacular storyline and script and over running in the middle due to plot padding , is one of the best action films of all time displaying Chans best choreography , best filmed action and arguably his most spectacular stunt making this essential viewing for everyone . Afterall , we watch a Chan movie for the action !  
  I 've been a Jennifer Connelly fan since Phenomena , and after I heard about seven minutes in heaven , I saw it as soon as I could . The movie is not only a comedy if you think a lot of these things most of us went through as kids and are currently going through not only was the movie terrific led by the phenomenal jennifer connelly it captivated my attention that this movie was terrifically written directed and acted out it was one good deal I loved it and have watched it again and again and for those of you who enjoy a good laugh or love jennifer connelly you to can not put off seeing this movie !  
  I did not set very high expectations for this movie , which left me pleasantly surprised . The story is a little strange sometimes but overall I think it has an acceptable credibility . The action scenes are rather nice and the accompanying music is used to induce a a bit of patriotic feelings common to US movies . This may not be the best movie ever but it 's uncommon for Sweden and I hope to see more similar ones in the future .  
  Overall , I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers . However , I really want to note the similarities between parts of this film and Nichols ' Closer . One scene especially where Adrian Grenier 's character is questioning Rosario Dawson 's about her sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in Closer where Clive Owen 's character is questioning Julia Roberts , although it is acted with less harshness and intensity in " Love . " Also note that " Anna " is the name of both Dawson 's and Roberts ' character . Can't be coincidence . Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber 's play and supposedly this film is loosely based on Arthur Schnitzler 's " Reigen " so I 'm not sure how this connection formed . Anyone have an idea ?  
  This film sat on my Tivo for weeks before I watched it . I dreaded a self-indulgent yuppie flick about relationships gone bad . I was wrong ; this was an engrossing excursion into the screwed-up libidos of New Yorkers . The format is the same as Max Ophuls ' " La Ronde , " based on a play by Arthur Schnitzler , who is given an " inspired by " credit . It starts from one person , a prostitute , standing on a street corner in Brooklyn . She is picked up by a home contractor , who has sex with her on the hood of a car , but can't come . He refuses to pay her . When he 's off peeing , she answers his cell phone and takes a message . She runs away with his keys . Then the story switches to the contractor , who pays a professional call on a rich , bored New York woman , who plays with him until he is aroused , then she pulls away . She tells him how desperate and unhappy she is ; he tells her how beautiful she is , and lucky . As he is leaving , she asks if he would have sex with her . She sits on top of him , bounces up and down . This time he comes , the he leaves . The woman and her husband throw a dinner party for their trendy friends . Hubby ( Robert ) is talking business , wife ( Ellen ) is bored , and switches the subject to sex , and how often men and women think about it . Husband switches conversation to desert . Later , after the guests leave , Ellen tries to entice Robert into sex . Robert wants none of it , and puts on a jazz record . Ellen turns on the radio ; Robert turns up the music ; Ellen turns on the TV ; Robert turns on another TV . Cacophony ensues . Ellen goes up on the roof , Robert joins her . Ellen confesses that she needs to experience more men , men other than Robert . Robert says that he too needs to experience men . We next follow Robert as he visits an artist , Martin , played by Steve Buscemi . I wish Buscemi could have more roles like this , where he is a sexy , smart , totally desirable guy . Robert praises Martin 's work , much more than it deserves , promises to get it into a show . Martin is excited , until it turns out that Robert is speaking out of his groin , it is all a mating dance . Robert tries to kiss Martin , on the lips , and Martin pulls back , saying that he is not gay . Robert asserts that he 's not gay either , Martin scoffs . Both admit that the artworks are bad . Robert is about to leave , when Martin allows Robert to kiss him . They make out , and Robert goes down on Martin . Next we follow Martin , as he prepares for an art show at a Manhattan gallery . He is smitten by the receptionist , Anna , played by Rosario Dawson . ( I had to cut some of this review to keep it under 1000 words ) .. and they make love to each other . We next follow Anna , who is sitting at a lunch stand . Her boyfriend , Nick ( Adrian Grenier ) , enters , bearing flowers . She is cold toward him ; he tries to figure out why . He coaxes out of her the information that she has had sex with someone while he was in San Francisco . She coaxes out of him the fact that he has stayed with his ex-gf while in San Francisco , and had sex with her . The latter revelation turns out to be a lie . The two of them make out in the luncheonette , but she decides that they must break up . Nick is heartbroken . And we follow Nick , who confesses his troubles to an older woman who he meets on a park bench , Joey ( Carol Kane ) . Joey is sort of weird and child-like , but is a good audience for Nick , who needs a sympathetic ear . The two of them go to Coney Island at night , and look at the stars . Nick falls under Joey 's spell , despite the age difference between them . They go back to Joey 's apartment , and Nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman . She is on top of him , doesn't want to let him go . But he manages to escape . ( This is , by the way , the best Carol Kane role since she played Latke 's wife in Taxi . ) Joey 's phone rings , and it is a man calling the Psychic Friends Network , and Joey is one of the psychic friends . Although she is still hurting from Nick , she gradually gets into her psychic shtick . The man is at his office , late at night , and wants to have phone sex with her . Although that is not Joey 's business , Joey goes along , and coaxes the man to come . She wants to keep talking , although the man want to get off the phone , and finds out that he has embezzled a lot of money from his company , and will be found out tomorrow . His life is ruined . Joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide , and she tries to make him believe that she is his friend , that she cares about him . And she does care about him . But the man packs a gun into his briefcase , and goes off to seek a prostitute on the Brooklyn waterfront , and we come back to the beginning , to the same prostitute who started out La Ronde . She wants to give him $ 75,000 in cash if she will kill him . He tried to kill himself , but couldn't do it . The prostitute does not want to do it , but he insists , holding her hand , holding the gun inside his mouth , telling her where to aim . Eventually , the gun goes off , and we see the prostitute walking down the street , and arriving at the corner where she normally does business . The contractor who didn't pay her earlier in the movie drives up , rolls down the window . They look at each other . THE END .  
  Okay - I 'll confess . This is the movie that made me love what Michael Keaton could do . He does a beautiful parody of someone doing a parody of James Cagney , with charm to spare . The supporting cast are solid workers all , and will step right up and do a fine job in this ' 80s comedy . A spoof of the ' 30s-'40s gangster movies , it breaks new ground constantly , with remarkably original material . ( Well , yeah - some of it has been copied since - but when this movie was made , it was original , and much of it has _ not _ been copied elsewhere . ) Watch Joe Piscopo warn people to not do _ , with one of the great taglines of spoofs . Watch Roman Moronie do things with English profanity that would make your spinster grammar teacher laugh . Watch amazing sight gags , such as pet-store owner Johnny Kelly using the price-tag gun on his puppies and dusting his kittens . Watch the greatest " warning against sex " educational film ever made . Watch the most amazing misrepresentation of church Latin done , while a guy who never took shop class assembles a Thompson machine gun from parts . Watch lines you 'll be using in casual conversation for the next decade . Watch Maureen Stapleton do the perfect antithesis to the hard-working mom , with surprise gags that you 'll never see coming . If you see a gag that doesn't hit your funny bone , be patient - another will come along in 30 seconds or less , and the odds are , you 'll need to pause until you 're done rolling on the floor several times . Duckies and Bunnies ? Them , too . Watch for the subtle stuff - some of the sight gags can go by unnoticed the first few viewings . There are a few minor flaws - but it 's probably the best of the spoofs . Some come close , but none of them are quite this good .  
  Sad story of a downed B-17 pilot . Brady is shot down over occupied territory . The local ranchers extended him kindness and protection at the cost of their own lives . I had never heard of this movie and it snagged me for two hours . After the film is over , I 'm glad I took the time . It 's an entire story told to explain the look on Brady 's face at the start of the film .  
  This movie is rich with action and gore . The story line is strong enough to support the action sequences . The English version needs a tad bit of help in the dubbing department but it was still enjoyable . This movie ranks among my personal favorites next to " Hard Boiled " ..  
  A bus full of passengers is stuck during a snow storm . The police have closed the bridge-saying it 's unsafe and they are stuck in a little café until the road has been cleared . However , after a while , their boredom is turned to concern , as it seems that one of the passengers was NOT originally on the bus and may just be an alien ! This leads to a conclusion that is ironic but also rather funny in a low-brow way . This is another of the fun episodes of The Twilight Zone . Instead of the typical twists or social commentary , this one features no lasting message . However , it 's also very and watchable , so who cares ? ! Exactly WHAT occurs you 'll just have to see for yourself . By the way , this one stars John Hoyt-a face most of you will recognize from countless old TV shows and movies . In almost every case , he played a real grouch ( like Charles Lane during the same era ) , but boy did I love seeing him-as he perfected the grouchy persona and was kind of funny at the same time .  
  It is unusual to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest , if any , without his presence . Despite a not outstanding direction - in fact , there are many scenes that seem to have been shooted too quickly and carelessly - , a seemingly low budget , a strange plot about a man who wants to take the place of a defrocked priest and another week points , the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so impressive that one gets shocked from the very begining to the terrible end . I have never seen nor can iomagine for future a better performance , even Paul Scofield acting in " A man for all seasons " . Actually the end could be considered even ridiculous if Fresnay were not playing the transtorned priest who returns to Church by performing a crime . " Je suis Maurice Morand , prètre catholique " ( " I am Maurice Morand , a catholic priest " ) is said with such a brilliancy that one may forget the madness that conducted to that end . The other impressive thing this film has is a single scene in wich Morand - who despite being a defrocked one is stil a priest - consacrates in a cabaret a huge amount of vine turning it into Christ´s blood . Gérard - the man that wants to return Morand to the Church or replace him by himself - has to drink it if he doesn´t want to leave it in the cabaret . He does so in mid of cheers and applauses from people who think that he is simply drinking three of four litters of vine . In next scene , the dialoque between Morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable . " Do you carry away men too ? " asks Morand , who hates himself for what he has just done . " That would be too much work " is the smart answer . The rest of the film is not worth commenting but it is certainly worth seeing due to the very strong and strangely emotive atmosphere created all the time . I think that " Le défroqué " is a very strange film , but has to be seen by all viewers - if the are good catholiques it is mandatory - because it is a very rare jewell in film history .  
  It 's nice to see a film with real people with honest feelings . Sissy Spacek is so absolutely convincing as a simple , yet nice , daughter to Robert Farnsworth , who finally , in his last role , gets to show what a fine actor he was . It is hard to believe that this is a David Lynch film . It is slow and even , sweet and moving . One of the best unless you like car chases , sex scenes , and violence .  
  " A truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love " describes this odd David Lynch film . This was especially " odd " because it wasn't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 - 20 years . Those were dark and shocking films ( Blue Velvet , Wild At Heart , Mulholland Drive ) and this is the opposite . I know it disappointed a lot of his fans . Others were delighted by it . Count me as one of the latter , and I own all three of those " dark " films , too . This was another supposed-true life story , here detailing an elderly man 's trip in a seated lawnmower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies . Well , I guess that premise - an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles - still makes this an " odd " film of sorts , so Lynch stays in character with that ! Richard Farnsworth plays the title role . He is the type of guy , face-wise , voice-wise , low-key personality-wise , that just about everyone likes . The wrinkles on his face tell many a story . It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released . The first 25 minutes of this film isn't much , and not always pleasant as it shows the main character 's adult and mentally-challenged child ( Sissy Spacek ) and her tragic past , but once Alvin Straight ( Farnsworth ) begins his trip , the story picks up . I played this for several friends and they thought the film NEVER picked up , but I am more generous with it . I think it 's a hidden gem . To them , it was a sleeping pill . I found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is NOT going to be a suspenseful Lynch crime story . It IS slow and if that 's okay with you , you might like this . Charm enters the picture in some of people Alvin meets along the way , such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble . ( Henry Cada as " Daniel Riordan , is a standout in that regard . ) Harry Dean Stanton gets third billing , but that 's a joke : he 's only in the final few minutes of the movie ! The Iowa scenery is pleasant . I lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil . It 's a nice state with nice people .. like this movie .  
  Apart from having the longest reign in British history ( 63 years ) , Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions . She was , apart from our current Queen , the oldest ever British monarch , living to the age of 81 . And she was also the youngest ever British ( as opposed to English or Scottish ) monarch , coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen . And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her , they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl ; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in " Mrs Brown " . " The Young Victoria " tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign . It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal , Sarah Duchess of York , whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra . There are three main strands to the plot . The first concerns the intrigues of Victoria 's mother , the Duchess of Kent , a highly unpopular figure even with her own daughter , largely because of the influence of her adviser Sir John Conroy , who was widely rumoured to be her lover . ( According to one unfounded rumour he , and not the late Duke of Kent , was Victoria 's natural father ) . The second strand concerns the growing romance between Victoria and her German cousin Prince Albert , and the attempts of King Leopold of Belgium , who was uncle to both of them , to influence this romance . ( Leopold 's hope was to increase the prestige of the House of Saxe-Coburg , to which both he and Albert belonged ) . The third concerns one of the strangest episodes in British political history , the Bedchamber Crisis of 1839 , when supporters of the Tory Party ( which had traditionally supported a strong monarchy ) rioted because the young Queen was perceived to favour the Whig Party and their leader Lord Melbourne , even though the Whigs had historically supported a quasi-republican system of government , with the monarch reduced to a figurehead . Scriptwriter Julian Fellowes is known for his Conservative views , and at times I wondered if this may have coloured his treatment of political themes , as he seems to lean to the side of the Tories , the predecessors of the modern Conservative party . Their leader Robert Peel is shown as statesmanlike and dignified , whereas Melbourne , for all his dash and charm , is shown as devious and uninterested in social reform . There may be some truth is these characterisations , but Fellowes glosses over the fact that only a few years earlier the Tories had opposed the Reform Act , which ended the corrupt electoral system of rotten boroughs , and that they had benefited from William IV 's unconstitutional dismissal of a Whig administration . Lessons in dynastic and constitutional history do not always transfer well to the cinema screen , and this one contains its share of inaccuracies . Prince Albert , for example , was not injured in Edward Oxford 's attempt on Victoria 's life , and Melbourne ( in his late fifties at the time of Victoria 's accession ) was not as youthful as he is portrayed here by Paul Bettany . King William IV certainly disliked the Duchess of Kent ( who was his sister-in-law ) , but I doubt if he would have gone so far as to bawl abuse at her during a state banquet , as he is shown doing here . I also failed to understand the significance of the scene in which the Duchess and Conroy try to force Victoria to sign a " Regency Order " ; the Duchess 's constitutional position was made clear by the Regency Act 1830 , which provided that she would become Regent if her daughter was still under eighteen at the time of her accession . No piece of paper signed by Victoria could have altered the provisions of the Act . There are also occasional infelicities . In one early scene we see Victoria and Albert playing chess while comparing themselves to pawns being moved around a chessboard , a metaphor so hackneyed that the whole scene should have come complete with a " Danger ! Major cliché ahead ! " warning . Yet in spite of scenes like this , I came to enjoy the film . There were some good performances , especially from Miranda Richardson as the scheming Duchess and Mark Strong as the obnoxious Conroy . It is visually very attractive , being shot in sumptuous style we have come to associate with British historical drama . Jim Broadbent gives an amusing turn as King William , although he does occasionally succumb to the temptation of going over the top . ( Although not as disastrously over the top as he was in " Moulin Rouge " ) . The main reason for the film 's success , however , is the performances of Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend as the two young lovers Victoria and Albert . Blunt is probably more attractive than Victoria was in real life , but in her delightful portrayal the Queen is no longer the old lady of the popular imagination , the black-clad Widow of Windsor who was perpetually not amused , but a determined , strong-minded and loving young woman . Her love for Albert , and their happy family life together , was one of the main reasons why the monarchy succeeded in reestablishing itself in the affections of the British people . ( With the exception of George II , Victoria 's Hanoverian ancestors had been notoriously lacking in the matrimonial virtues ) . Blunt and Friend make " The Young Victoria " a touching romance and a gripping human drama as well as an exploration of a key period in British history . 8/10  
  This movie appears to have designed as a Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers film-the plot outline , dance numbers , zippy music and the entire formula is there .. except for Ginger ! Whether it REALLY was originally intended as a re-pairing of the team is uncertain but it sure has the look of one of these films . Instead of the usual sidekicks for Fred ( such as Eric Blore or Edward Everett Horton ) , Burns and Allen are used-probably since despite being known as a comedy team , they COULD sing and dance quite well . This actually shocked me , but the team were a welcome addition and some of the traditional Fred and Ginger numbers were done with either Fred and Gracie or these two along with George . Only once , at the very end , does Ms . Fontaine dance with Fred but it 's very brief and with a distant camera shot . And speaking of Burns and Allen , I think I owe it to the team to talk about them in the film . I have never been a fan of their show or their movies . In general , I find Gracie 's idiot act very annoying and I have given some poor reviews to their movie shorts and full-length films . However , in this film I must admit that they were great-not only dancing competently but I actually thought they were funny and filled the hole left by Edward Everett Horton very nicely . They were on top of their game and the writers did a wonderful job in this department . Now as for the rest of the film , it 's all a lot of fun and is entertaining . The problem for me , though , was that Joan Fontaine was not a particularly good choice for the movie-not just because she was acting outside her range ( after all , she wasn't a singer or dancer ) , but because she had the screen presence of a ball of lint . Because of this , the usual balance and great boy-girl dialog was lacking . There was also a very charming performance by Harry Watson as a devilish little boy who did everything he could do to play cupid-all because he wanted to win a bet ! And finally , I loved the Fun House and Tunnel of Love sequence-it is too hard to describe but is so much fun to watch ! Overall , I did like the film quite a bit-it had a lot of charm and excellent writing . Unfortunately , it also featured a bland performance by Ms . Fontaine that knocks off a point-bringing my score for this film to 7 .  
  I read that Jessie Matthews was approached and turned down co-starring with Fred Astaire in Damsel in Distress . Jessie Matthews in her prime never left her side of the pond to do any American musical films . IF they had teamed for this film it would have been a once in a lifetime event . It 's a pity because Damsel in Distress has everything else going for it . Fred Astaire , story and adapted to screen by author P.G. Wodehouse , Burns & Allen for comedy , and songs by the Gershwin Brothers . In answer to the question posed by the Nice Work If You Can Get It , there isn't much you could ask more for this film . Except a leading lady . Though Ginger Rogers made several films away from Fred Astaire , Damsel in Distress is the only film Astaire made without Rogers while they were a team . Young Joan Fontaine was cast in this opposite Astaire . Her character has none of the bite that Ginger Rogers 's parts do in these films . All she basically has to do is act sweet and demure . She also doesn't contribute anything musically . And if I had to rate all the dancing partners of Fred Astaire , Joan Fontaine would come out at the bottom . The poor woman is just horrible in the Things Are Looking Up number . When she co-starred later on in a musical with Bing Crosby , The Emperor Waltz , it 's no accident that Fontaine is given nothing musical to do . The version I have is a colorized one and in this case I think it actually did some good . The idyllic lush green English countryside of P.G. Wodehouse is really brought out in this VHS copy . Especially in that number I mentioned before with Astaire and Fontaine which does take place in the garden . Burns & Allen on the other hand as a couple of old vaudeville troopers complement Astaire in grand style in the Stiff Upper Lip number . The surreal fun-house sequence is marvelously staged . P.G. Wodehouse 's aristocracy runs the gamut with Constance Collier at her haughty best and for once Montagu Love as Fontaine 's father as a nice man on film . The biggest hit out of A Damsel in Distress is A Foggy Day maybe the best known song about the British capital city since London Bridge Is Falling Down . Done in the best simple elegant manner by Fred Astaire , it 's one of those songs that will endure as long as London endures and even after . Overlooking the young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine , A Damsel in Distress rates as a classic , classic score , classic dancing , classic comedy . Who could ask for anything more ?  
  Kusturika made it again . Another masterpiece . A coral comedy full of his own landmarks , with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments , we laughed and laughed , what a party ! The music is everywhere , and also the shooting , the animals , the crazy bastards , sex and amazing gadgets and inventions , everything colorfully visual to entertain only . Pure cinema in essence . A wonderful experience to watch . And one is specially grateful since good comedies are so rare , and so wonderful . Well , this is one , and if you enjoyed Kusturica 's previous films , you 'll love this , although , as in all comedies , it is about a chemical reaction , and you have to be in the mood for it .  
  " Kaabee " depicts the hardship of a woman in pre and during WWII , raising her kids alone after her husband imprisoned for " thought crime " . This movie was directed by Yamada Youji , and as expected the atmosphere of this movie is really wonderful . Although the historical correctness of some scenes , most notably the beach scene , is a suspect . The acting in this movie is absolutely incredible . I am baffled at how they managed to gather this all-star cast for a 2008 film . Yoshinaga Sayuri , possibly the most decorated still-active actress in Japan , will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film . Shoufukutei Tsurube in a supporting role was really nice as well . It was Asano Tadanobu though , who delivered the most impressive performance , perfectly portraying the wittiness of his character and the difficult situation he was in . Films with pre-war setting is not my thing , but thanks to wonderful directing and acting , I was totally absorbed by the story . Also , it wasn't a far-left nonsense like " Yuunagi no Machi , Sakura no Kuni " , and examines the controversial and sensitive issue of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred in that period in Japan . Excellent film , highly recommended for all viewers .  
  It 's rare that I sit down in front of the TV specifically to watch a particular programme . It 's even rarer when I actually enjoy the programme in the end , but Last of the Blonde Bombshells was one of the best movies I think I 've seen . A remarkable cast , led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm , and an excellent , witty and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience . I can't really express how good I thought it was , so I won't try , I 'll just say , if you get the opportunity , PLEASE SEE IT ! I only hope it comes out on video .  
  No message . No symbolism . No dark undercurrents . Just a wonderful melange of music , nostalgia and good fun put to-gether by people who obviously had a great time doing it . It 's a refreshing antidote to some of the pretentious garbage being ground out by the studios . Of course ANYTHING with the incomparable Judi Dench is worth watching . And Cleo Laine 's brilliant jazz singing is a bonus . This lady is in the same league as the late Ella . This goes on my movie shelf to be pulled out again anytime I feel the need for a warm experience and a hearty good natured chuckle . Just a wonderful film !  
  Like A Streetcar Named Desire ( also directed by Gadg both on stage and screen ) Panic In The Streets depicts a New Orleans in which its major claim to fame - the birthplace of Jazz - doesn't even rate a mention . It was Richard Widmark 's seventh film and arguably went a long way to establishing him as the fine actor he really was rather than merely a psychotic killer . Gadg himself appears in an uncredited small role as a morgue attendant but the film is rich in talent beginning with Jack Palance ( still being billed as Walter Jack Palance ) as the local Mr ' Big ' followed side-kick Zero Mostel , Barbara Bel Geddes , Emile Meyer , Tommy Rettig plus the rock-solid ever reliable Paul Douglas as the cop who comes round to doc Widmark 's point of view . It 's a very rewarding movie more so for being little seen . Catch it if you can .  
  I can't really condemn the movie because it does work . There is enough film noir elements to consider it a noir movie , but I think it 's only just in the category . There 's nothing sinister in this piece , and that 's where the noir elements fail . Sure , the disease might be considered sinister , but I have a hard time seeing that . The movie hints at a darker side : Blackie may be trafficking human beings , the New Orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter , the specter of the plague hangs over all of the people in the movie .. but those are really only hints . There 's no attempt made to question Reed 's motivations , as one with do with Marlowe or Spade , nor is there any attempt to bring a humans side to Blackie , which would make him even more contemptuous if the human trafficking was actually played out . That lack of depth is what fails the movie in the end . The story is decent , the acting is good , the writing and direction are well done .. but there is nothing to make this a movie you should return to over and over . Worth watching once , maybe twice if you don't remember it from years ago , and then putting away .  
  This movie is about human relationships . Charming , funny , and well written , with meaningful text . It seems that Morgan Freeman surely have fun at the set . Also good music . Paz Vega is a beautiful and smart woman . I really enjoy her acting . Woman like her are a good motivation to learn Spanish language . From the moment Morgan Freeman meets the cute Paz Vega the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers learning to care about where their lives are headed . 10 Items or Less is about zest of life . If you enjoy this film see also The Pursuit of Happiness with Will Smith and his son . Thats not a action film or a nude comedy . Its all about human relations .  
  Bravo ! Morgan Freeman is an actor , who researches a character he is selected to play , before he makes a commitment . Freeman is a ' good fit ' for this film ( like he was for " Driving Miss Daisy " ) , and he is not only believable , but he gets a chance to change his image of playing a character with reserved dignity and propriety . Although there are no guarantees in life , for anyone , this gives an actor a great opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out , in order to avoid getting stereotyping . And it must be said that stereotyping has hampered , or completely ruined , a significant number of acting careers . This is a low-budget film that , amazingly , was made in a time span of only two weeks . It is a film that is well directed and written by Brad Silberling . The location manager chose Carson , CA for the film 's setting , and the location helps set the tone and timing for the film . The editing is fair to good , but a little rough . Silberling was the ' subcontractor ' , in getting Freeman to do this film , while the actor was in-between film projects . There is a good chemistry between Freeman and Paz Vega , a Spanish actress , and this opens an effective dialog between each of the cast members , who are diverse and come from different cultures . The film also encourages an understanding between people , who not only speak two languages ( English and Spanish ) , but come from two different worlds of ethnicity , race , gender , norms , mores , beliefs , folkways , principles , and values . The film strives for some honesty , and arrives at some truth , to maintain the film 's integrity . Part of the comedy is that Freeman plays an unemployed actor that has been out of work for four years . In truth , Freeman is so-in-demand as an actor that he is constantly working . The film offers an adventure of bonding , caring , sharing , changing , and exchanging . And , the film 's outtakes give the viewer a preview of some of things an actor must go through in preparing for a role . If necessary , tell your boss that you 're taking a ' mental health day ' , and go see this film . If you 're able , take your significant other or your family with you . I rank the film a 10 out of 10 . It 's enjoyable , interesting , informative , poignant , and worthwhile .  
  This is the start of a new and interesting Star Trek series . It has a " down to earth " - kind of feel with darker and less " plaggy " scenography . The characters need some more time to develop but they have potential . One thing that is fairly disappointing ( with all Star Trek series really ) is that they portray such a gloomy picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else . ( Earth has stopped war , famine etc ) The female characters here are two , subcommander T'Pol who is vulcan and communications officer Hoshi who is human . Hoshi is quite wimpy and T'Pol is made to be a " vulcan babe " . Some of the crew attitudes feel a bit too American ( as opposed to the more international feel of the TNG-crew ) but creates interesting dynamics . A very good pilot though for a very good series .  
  Knowing when to end a movie is just as important as casting , directing and acting . And it 's nice to see when a director / script get it right . Clocking in at just 82 minutes , 10 ITEMS OR LESS doesn't stretch the story , trying to grasp at inane topics . It stays focused , being funny , sad , and well thought out . Morgan Freeman ( LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN ) stars as " Him " , an aging actor grasping at any roles presented to him . We 're introduced to " Him " as he travels to a supermarket in an out of the way section of town by The Kid ( Jonah Hill , CLICK ) . Realizing he has a star in his car , The Kid pressures Him to talk about his absence in cinema over the past few years . Him isn't very forthcoming because , not only has he been out of it for while , he 's also en route to a shooting location of an indie film he might act in ( " I haven't decided if I 'm going to accept the part . " ) . The Kid is a relative of the director involved in this indie venture and soon drops him in the middle of nowheresville . Stuck , Him decides to check out the local market . He immediately runs into the beautiful Scarlet ( Paz Vega ) who operates the 10 items or less register . Not just strikingly pretty but intelligent , Him begins using her as his prime research subject for his upcoming independent film role . He learns how she figures out numbers so quickly and why she knows the quirks of every member of this isolated community . But Him doesn't just use Scarlet , he helps her so he can see deeper into her life . They travel together to get her car back from a cheating husband , and he teaches her how to act to get a new job she 's pining for , and how to dress for success even when confronted with Target as the epitome of local clothing . This is probably one of the funniest moments as we get a glimpse of Him , too , showing his complete lack of understanding of the chain-store retail world ( " These shirts are only $ 12 bucks ! How is this possible ? ! " ) The ending , as stated at the beginning of this review , is abrupt but apropos . There 's no way these two could ever remain friends even though they form a unique bond . They know when to say goodbye and what each garnered from the other . It 's a quiet but riveting moment as Scarlet 's clunker car sits idling outside Him 's L.A. mansion . This is a great independent production and one that wastes little time getting going . And it won't waste your time either .  
  This is an absurdist dark comedy from Belgium . Shot perfectly in crisp black and white , Benoît Poelvoorde ( Man Bites Dog ) is on fine form as Roger , the angry , obsessive father of a family in a small , sullen Belgian mining town . Roger is a photographer who , along with his young daughter Luise , visits road accidents to take photos . He is also obsessed with winning a car by entering a competition where the contestant has to break a record - and he decides that his son , Michel , must attempt to break the record of perpetually walking through a door - he even hires an overweight coach to train him . Michel dresses as Elvis and has a spot on a radio show called ' Cinema Lies ' , where he describes mistakes in films . Luise is friendly with near neighbour Felix , a pigeon fancier . Roger is a callous figure as he pushes Michel right over the limit during the record attempt , which almost results in his death . Interspersed throughout the film are Magritte-like surreal images . It 's undeniably charming and well worth your time .  
  Man 's Castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called ' Hoovervilles ' named after our unfortunate 31st president who got stuck with The Great Depression occurring in his administration . The proposition of this film is that a man 's home is still his castle even when it 's just a shack in a Hooverville . Spencer Tracy has such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much . But in a part very typical for Tracy before he was cast as a priest in San Francisco , the start of a slew of classic roles , he 's playing a tough good natured mug who takes in Loretta Young . One of the things about Man 's Castle is that it shows the effects of the Depression on women as well as men . Women had some additional strains put on them , if men had trouble finding work , women had it twice as hard . And they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal . Spence takes Loretta Young in who 's facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in his castle . Pretty soon though they 're in love , though Tracy is not the kind to settle down . The love scenes had some extra zing to them because Tracy and Young were having a torrid affair during the shooting of Man 's Castle . And both were Catholic and married and in those days that was an insuperable barrier to marriage . Both Tracy and Young took the Catholic faith quite seriously . Also in the cast are Walter Connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp , Marjorie Rambeau who 's been through all the pitfalls Young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and Arthur Hohl , a really loathsome creep who has his eye on Young as well . Hohl brings the plot of Man 's Castle to its climax through his scheming . Man 's Castle is grim look at the Great Depression , not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment .  
  Barbra Streisand 's debut television special is still a pinnacle moment in entertainment history - in any media . Cleverly divided into three separate acts ( to minimize the interruption of commercial breaks ) , Streisand made the bold-yet-masterful decision to drop the typical variety show format of the time ( which is why there is no guest stars nor forced banter ) and carry the entire show on her shoulders alone . The risky move paid off enormously , as MY NAME IS BARBRA set a new standard for musical programming on television . Filmed in glorious black-and-white ( which actually adds to the effectiveness of the show ) , MY NAME IS BARBRA is flawlessly-conceived and impressively shot . However , what makes the show truly transcendent is Streisand herself . Watching the then-23 year old performer navigate herself through the show 's 55 minute runtime is nothing less than thrilling . She is in fantastic voice ( and even performs the entire first and third acts live ) , and gives first evidence of the immense star power that would soon follow her to the big screen . The special 's biggest asset is it 's boldness in allowing Streisand to simply stand on stage and sing some great songs . After the powerful opening performance of " Much More " ( with a brief opening snippet from Leonard Bernstein 's " My Name Is Barbara " ) , Barbra proceeds to wander through a multi-level studio set performing a frantic version of the Disney classic " I 'm Late . " In between verses of " I 'm Late , " Streisand stops at various levels of the set to sing some terrific numbers such as the haunting " Make Believe " and the thundering " How Does the Wine Taste ? " Halfway through the Act I , Barbra re-enters her own childhood to the strains of " A Kid Again , " and then gives highly energetic performances of " I 'm Five " and " Sweet Zoo " while romping among an over-sized set . The illusion is eventually shattered , however , as Streisand finds herself out of the fantasy and back in the real world . She then sings about this lost childhood innocence in the lovely " Where Is the Wonder ? " Streisand then dashes out onto a platform stage surrounded by an entire room-full of musicians and performs a rousing rendition of " People " before the thunderous applause of a live studio audience . Act II of the special begins with Streisand hamming it up for the studio audience with a campy rendition of " I 've Got the Blues , " before delivering a comedy monologue about " Pearl from Istanbul . " Streisand then heads off to Bergdorf Goodman 's department store , which allows her to sing a medley of poverty songs while parading around in some of the store 's elegant fashions . This segment is the brightest highlight of the special for many fans and critics . Some high points of the Act II medley include Streisand singing a restrained version of " Second Hand Rose " to the audience , appearing as a Latin bullfighter to the tune of " Nobody Knows You When You 're Down and Out , " and portraying a frustrated paperboy while mugging to " Brother , Can You Spare a Dime . " The third Act of the special is a straight concert , with no set pieces or concepts . Streisand is a performer who really thrives on the concert stage , and this segment is the most thrilling moment of the special . Streisand enters belting out an almost gravity-defying rendition of " When the Sun Comes Out , " and continues to amaze the viewer with a lovely version of THE YEARLING ballad " Why Did I Choose You , " a scorching performance of " Lover Come Back to Me , " and an impassioned medley of three songs form FUNNY GIRL . Streisand really outdoes herself , however , with a phenomenal rendition of the Fanny Brice / Billie Holiday standard " My Man , " which instantly became on of the singer 's best-loved signature songs . Streisand performs her immortal ballad version of " Happy Days Are Here Again " as the closing credits roll by on the left-hand side of the screen . The iconic finish to the number reaffirms to the viewer that he or she has indeed seen something truly special . MY NAME IS BARBRA was a huge rating triumph when first aired , and it eventually picked up five Emmy awards in addition to spawning two Top-Five , Gold-selling soundtrack albums . Watching it all again , it 's absolutely no surprise .  
  Frailty-8/10-It 's non-sensical title and " Bill Paxton Directs " headline aside , this is a pretty good old fashioned rip snorting biblical horror thriller . In the end , it may end up only being the inbred Southern Gothic cousin of Kubrick 's " The Shining " - but hey , that 's a pretty damn entertaining notion . It 's also got a doozy of a plot twist .. and a very ambiguous moral message . This is the kind of movie that years from now people will catch late at night on basic cable and scare the beejesus out of themselves watching it . Too bad director Bill Paxton had to go hire himself to star .. oh well .. still a devil of a good rent .  
  amazing movie I saw this movie for the first time on a flight and could not believe that I had not even heard of it before getting on that plane . while it may seem , at first to be a " chick flick " , it is a film that everyone should see and will enjoy . Men , watch this movie with someone you love . You will enjoy it as much as she does and it will score you big points .  
  If you know the story of Grey Owl , you 'll love the movie ! Annie Galipeau is a great actress , and Pierce is better than never in Grey Owl . But in this movie there 's no real scene of action . I think this movie should be nominated at the Oscars ! Well go see this movie , it 's A CLASSIC !  
  This is a very rare film and probably the least known from Shirley Temple as it isn't on any of her collections . The reason why is probably because it doesn't have a happy ending , unlike all her other films . Its also not a musical , although she does belt out one song called ' The world owes me a living ' . The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white , the version i have is in colour and on VHS , i would say they have done a fine job as the colour does look realistic , unlike i would say the colourised films of Laurel And Hardy which are dreadful . The film is good for its age and the story hasn't dated at all , I 'm surprised no one has tried to do a remake . At times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem really dragged out , in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five . Although don't be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in it , especially when { Jerry } Gary Cooper steals a necklace , and hides it in Shirley 's teddy bear . The tension and slow build up to his actions , { while at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another room } is very well directed . Gary and Caroles edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very good . In all this is a good film from the early 30 's , accept it for its age .  
  Quick and simple , I love this movie . As some others have mentioned , I also , am not from the south , don't really care for country music and have never worn a cowboy hat . ( I 've never drove around in a car with a dead body in my trunk either , but I love " Goodfellas . " ) This is just great film making . Shot in a 2.35 aspect ratio and beautifully transfered to DVD . ( The VHS was 1.33 full screen ) . And yes , a solid 5.1 mix for your viewing pleasure . What can you say about this movie ? It 's just a great love / hate story set in Texas , with great performances . Travolta is fantastic . Next to " Pulp Fiction " , it 's the best thing he 's done . It 's been in my top 5 for 25 years ! Check this one out ! It 's a 10 !  
  Jazz aficionados will treasure this classic short showing some of the best men of jazz just doing their thing . It 's like watching a no frills music video today . The jazz men give us an additional treat in the person of Marie Bryant who sings a classic version of On The Sunny Side Of The Street . I had never heard her sing before , Bryant sounds remarkably like Billie Holliday . That 's a compliment folks . Their instrumental work is tops as well . With the black cinema of its time fed a lot of white stereotypes , this film is to be watched and treasured . No great production values , just a lot of good music .  
  There is no greater disservice to do to history than to misrepresent it . This takes the easiest and most shallow route , simply portraying him as a monster . Only showing his negative sides , and exaggerating them . " Those who are ignorant of the past doom us to repeat it " . He was a human being . That may prove tough to some people to accept , but an important part of life is facing that which we don't want to . Rather than demonizing the man , we ought to try to understand him . Otherwise , we stand little chance of preventing anyone similar in the future , or possibly even the present , from succeeding at anything of remotely comparable scope , as far as damage and misery goes . Hate him and what he did , don't make him into something mythical , intentionally or otherwise . Frankly , far too much of this mini-series could play " dumb dumb * duum * ! " after or during scenes . The whole thing nods , nudges and winks at the audience , with a clear message of " was this guy evil or what " , incorporating every single bad trait ( as well as making up several that go directly against who and what he was ) , letting them appear more or less out of nowhere , and having them be constant throughout his life , not something he came to believe or claimed to . This should never be used to educate . Use Der Untergang ( Downfall , in English ) , and maybe point out the few inaccuracies of that , instead . This , this is disrespectful to the actual events that took place , and to any and all survivors , not to mention those who died . The cinematic quality ? Top-notch . It 's well-done , through and through , excellent production values , a solid arc to the well-told plot , what characterization does occur is strong and credible , dialog and script are great , all acting performances are masterful ( Carlyle looks and behaves the role .. as it was written .. perfectly ) , the music is well-composed , cinematography and editing are flawless and creative , and this is definitely dramatic , entertaining and riveting . They get dates and many occurrences , and do them justice . If I had been offered to work on this , and did not feel I could be objective enough to have Hitler appear as a fully fleshed-out person , I would have declined , citing that as the reason . I don't blame anyone for loathing him . How can you forgive what he did , and are we sure that we should ? That is not what I am suggesting . Finally , let me point out that , as I write this , we are in a world-wide economic crisis that has lasted for about two years , and that is not terribly dissimilar to the stock market crash of 1929 . The two reasons it hasn't led to a depression of the new millennium are as follows : governments are giving money to the banks to keep the market going , and the majority of the countries is now friendly towards one another . Apart from that , the lesson hadn't been learned . Hopefully , it has now . Back to this .. my suggestion ? Read a book , non-fiction , dealing with the subject . There are plenty of informative , smart ones . The DVD holds a trailer . I recommend this only to those who know better , and vehemently urge anyone who has watched it , to seek out the truth . 8/10  
  Pressburger and Powell 's greatest movie . David Niven plays the RAF bomber pilot who misses his own death but is granted a second chance at life when heaven notices that he is AWOL and dispatches an angel to investigate . The scene when the young soldiers , men and women , black and white , all killed in action , arrive in heaven to be processed for eternal life is unbearably poignant . Watch out too for Roger Livesey , a deeply under appreciated actor , and Kim Hunter as the love interest ( later , of course , Zira in Planet of the Apes ) . Incidentally , Steven Spielberg cast the actress who played the chief angel ( Kathleen Byron ) as the elderly wife of the eponymous private in Saving Private Ryan half a century later , an act that speaks volumes for his cinematic literacy .  
  The pros of this film are the astonishing fighting scenes - absolutely incredible sword-moves and martial art show off . A true John Woo masterpiece . The story tends to be a bit week though , but it never overshadows the overwhelming display of acrobatic martial art action . If you are into martial art movies , you are going to LOVE this one !  
  Rudy does it again with this hot off the streets follow up to Dolemite . This entry is filled with the requisite Rudy Ray Moore raunch , humor and martial arts . Rudy eludes a crazy red-neck sheriff in this movie that also features an infamous scene where Rudy dives down a steep hill . See it for laughs and for a brain-blasting hit of Blaxploitation magic .  
  Apparently Ruggero Deodato figured out , early on , that his story wouldn't work if he approached it too seriously , so he decided to camp it up . The result is a film that can be viewed as either a ludicrous sword-and-sorcery epic or as a very entertaining comedy ! And I think I 'll go the second way . The brief gore moments are well-done , the Paul Brothers openly mock the material ( they even bark at each other in one scene ! ) , and there is also a charming , spirited , good-natured performance by Eva La Rue , as the girl who tags along with the " boys " . Plus , where else can you see the insides of a dragon lighted like a discotheque ? ( * )  
  I love bad movies . Not only , because they often are as entertaining as ' really ' ' good ' films ( like Pirates of the Caribbean series and other Hollywood pathos ) , but they often are far better than those films . And that 's the reason why I love Italian rip off cinema of 1970s and 1980s . And that 's the reason why I especially love this movie , The Barbarians & the Company . Director Ruggero Deodato has made some actually very good movies , like House on the Edge of the Park , and also his Atlantis Interceptors and Live Like a Cop , Die Like a Man are enjoyable action movies . But this is really bad . The Barbarians is so idiotic movie . Peter and David Paul as the Barbarian Brothers Kutchek and Gore are very funny , because of their lack of charisma and acting skills . But if they can't act , they yell and scream every time they do something important . In one scene people try to hang the Barbarian Brothers , and they escape very extraordinary way . Bad acting , bad special effects , very stupid story , bad direction , actually everything is bad in this movie . I can't describe how much I laughed when I watched this first time . The Barbarians & the Company is camp classic everybody should see once . If you thought Plan 9 From Outer Space is fun camp , this will be a real killer .  
  Part of what was so great about the classic Looney Tunes cartoons was their irreverence and how they weren't afraid to do anything that they wanted . In this case , Marvin the Martian has an assignment to bring back an earthling . Sure enough , he comes across Bugs Bunny , who warns of a mutiny on the part of Marvin 's dog . After Marvin finally traps Bugs - by means of an Acme strait jacket-ejecting bazooka ! - Bugs has more stuff planned for the voyage back to Mars . What I mean is , if you thought that it was a major change in the Solar System when they stripped Pluto of its planet status , then you ain't seen nothing yet ! Yes , " The Hasty Hare " goes all out . How they buy Acme products in outer space is probably beyond most people , but the point here - I mean " hare " - is to have fun . And believe me , you definitely will . After all , a little space-out never hurt anyone .  
  This is one of quite a few cartoons with Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian - and a space dog called K-9 is included as well . This Looney Tunes episode is very funny , has reasonably good cartoon animation ( Marvin 's animation is very well done ) and the plot is well done . The end is rather weird , so be prepared for it , it is slightly boring . In this episode , Marvin the Martian has been sent to earth to capture an earth creature and bring it back to Mars . With his trusty dog K-9 , Marvin sets out and soon finds the tracks of no other rabbit but Bugs Bunny ! He greets them with treats , thinking they are trick or treaters in their costumes . Little does he realise they are preparing themselves to take this rabbit to Mars .. I recommend this episode to anyone who likes Bugs Bunny , Marvin the Martian and Looney Tunes in general . As far as the beginning and the middle of the episode are concerned , you are likely to like this . Enjoy " Hasty Hare " ! : - )  
  The best thing about this movie is that it is fun . It is full of humorous characters and interesting situations , starting with the blithe , innocent Pecker ( played appealingly by Edward Furlong ) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life . Other great characters include Pecker 's friend Matt ( " he 's a thief , but he 's really a nice guy " ) , Pecker 's sister Chrissy ( who is addicted to sugar ) , and Pecker 's Catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room . The movie gently makes a point about how every day life has many riches to offer , and it succeeds in making this point without being too heavy-handed about it . There is always a risk , when making messages about the value and dignity of " common people " , of sliding into a kind of reverse " holier than thou " - but " Pecker " avoids these traps , allowing the audience to get the point while allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subject . I recommend the movie mostly because it is a lot of fun .  
  Ida Lupino was one of the few women to break through the directorial glass ceiling in Hollywood under the studio system . Not surprisingly , she also tackled proto-feminist themes that , when touched at all , were approached in so gingerly a manner that it was seldom quite clear what was being talked about . In Outrage , she treats rape and its aftermath , and though throughout the short movie it 's referred to as ` criminal assault , ' she leaves , for once , no doubt about what happened . Mala Powers ( in her official debut ) plays a secretary-bookkeeper at a big industrial plant ; she lives with her parents but is engaged to a swell guy ( Robert Clarke ) , who just got a raise and now makes $ 90 a week . Leaving the plant after working late one night , she finds herself being stalked . In the ensuing scene  the best in the movie  she tries to escape her pursuer in a forbidding maze of buildings and alleys but fails . When she returns home , disheveled and in shock , the police can't get much out of her ; she claims she never saw her attacker ( who manned a snack truck outside the factory ) . Trying to pretend that nothing happened , she returns to her job but falls apart , thinking that everybody is staring at her , judging her . She goes into a fugue state , running away to Los Angeles on a bus but stumbling off at a rest stop . Waking up in a strange ranch house , she learns that she 's been rescued by Tod Andrews , a young minister in a California agricultural town . She lies about her identity and takes a job packing oranges . The two fall vaguely in love , but it 's clear to Andrews that Powers is keeping dire secrets . When , at a company picnic , she seizes a wrench and cracks the skull of Jerry Paris , who was trying to steal a kiss , the truth about her past comes out .. It was a courageous movie to come out in 1950 , and that may explain and excuse some of its shortcomings . Lupino never recaptures the verve of the early assault scene , and the movie wanders off into the bucolic and sentimental , ending up talky and didactic . Yes , Lupino had important information to impart , but she didn't trust the narrative to speak for itself . Her cast , pleasant but bland and generic , weren't much help , either , reverting to melodramatic postures or homespun reassurance . But Outrage was a breakthrough , blazing a trail for later discourse on what the crime of rape really is , and what it really means to its victims .  
  In light of bad reviews - or car crashes - I feel possessed to get in gear and make a transmission to give merit where due , and do a service . I 'm not sure people have license to say it was so bad , almost automatically . It 's rare for a movie to have SUSPENSE . This movie maintained suspense it 's whole length , for me , despite any flaws that may be . How many films can say that ? Not even many big ones . Because of the simple premise you don't know if the people will get out of the life-threatening situation , which lasts the whole movie . Yeh , the suspension was tight , and over some bumps the shocks did their work . It 's not just a TV movie , but an all-action movie ; there is no point where it stops , or deviates , or becomes talky . It would be hard to make a film like this , always on the road . Only Duel , or Speed , are this that I recall . The best thing in them also was the constant tension . ACTING is not bad : The Judge is as good as ever , and the others are . SCRIPT is good . But the jury is out as to whether it sometimes may be - or seem to be - a little awry . What seems unrealistic is not necessarily so . Your first judgments are not always right , but I think the lead actor 's was right in being in this movie . STUNTS are mostly terrific , especially for a TV movie . Their only failing may be the noticeable , and again , apparent , slow speed . But we all know how deceivingly slow Grand Prix cars can look . I liked that THE BEGINNING said , " inspired by a true story . " So you are not going to go how much is true ? You know just the basis is . The usual " based on a true story " makes me think it should mostly be true . But maybe that 's my error . HOW TO SAVE THEM : Good idea of the reviewer to suggest a tow truck to lift the back wheels up . Just a few inches would do . A stunt driver could do that at 100 mph . Odd that they didn't call a car expert - or auto electrician or mechanic - to see if there 's a way . I hope this review has put in reverse that this film is a disaster . Or at least neutral . And help it become a runaway success . Pic quality is a little soft for a DVD . SPOILER : They would have been winched out after the baby was , but strangely that life-saving idea was cleverly dealt with in some joking conversation to fade it out . I guess we know why . End of movie . Suspension of disbelief went out the top window with the baby .  
  To me A Matter of Life and Death is just that - simply the best film ever made . From beginning to end it oozes class . It is stimulating , thought provoking , a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoples . The cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and Technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly . The characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasy . No matter how many times I watch the film - and I have watched it a lot - it never fails to touch me . It makes me smile , it makes me laugh , it makes me think , it makes me cry . It is as fresh today as it was in 1946 . If I were allowed just one film to keep and watch again A Matter of Life and Death would be that film .  
  actually .. that " video camera " effect , is just that , it 's an effect , a rather good one .. ( u don't know much about directing a film do you ? ) this film is in fact BETTER than the original , it 's great fun to watch , made for TV , doesn't need to follow any rules . I find it hard to watch number 1 because of how he kills the first girl , its disturbing . and all the time we are routing for Judd Nelson to get away with it , we as the viewers are on his side . i hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake but i doubt it . Watching this film you can understand how real movies are made , as this is sort of like a film within a film . Judd is one of the scariest villains ever , and he 's more realistic , he doesn't just mindlessly chop people up like in other horrors .  
  A trio of buddies , sergeants all in the British Army , carouse & brawl their way across Imperial India . Intensely loyal to each other , they meet their greatest & most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult & its demented , implacable guru . Now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment , the water carrier GUNGA DIN , to save scores of the Queen 's soldiers from certain massacre . Based more on The Three Musketeers than Kipling 's classic poem , this is a wonderful adventure epic - a worthy entry in Hollywood 's Golden Year of 1939 . Filled with suspense & humor , while keeping the romantic interludes to the barest minimum , it grips the interest of the viewer and holds it right up to the ( sentimental ) conclusion . It is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars , Cary Grant , Victor McLaglen & Douglas Fairbanks Jr . , as they are really all thirds of a single organism - inseparable and , to all intents & purposes , indistinguishable . However , this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time . ( It 's interesting to note , parenthetically , that McLaglen boasted of a distinguished World War One military career ; Fairbanks would have a sterling record in World War Two - mostly in clandestine affairs & earning himself no fewer than 4 honorary knighthoods after the conflict ; while Grant reportedly worked undercover for British Intelligence , keeping an eye on Hollywood Nazi sympathizers . ) The real acting laurels here should go to Sam Jaffe , heartbreaking in the title role . He infuses the humble man with radiant dignity & enormous courage , making the last line of Kipling 's poem ring true . He is unforgettable . Montague Love is properly stalwart as the regimental major , whilst Eduardo Ciannelli is Evil Incarnate as the Thuggee guru . The rest of the cast , Joan Fontaine , Robert Coote , Lumsden Hare , are effective but have little to do . Movie mavens will recognize Cecil Kellaway in the tiny role of Miss Fontaine 's father . The film picks its villains well . The demonic Thuggee cult , worshipers of the hideous , blood-soaked Kali , Hindu goddess of destruction , was the bane of Indian life for 6 centuries , ritualistically strangling up to 30,000 victims a year . In 1840 the British military , in cooperation with a number of princely states , succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion . Henceforth it would remain the stuff of novels & nightmares .  
  Infamous pre-code film , really the one film that caused people to insist on the Hayes Code being strictly enforced . Barbara Stanwyck stars as a young girl whose liquor-selling father has no problem pimping her out to customers . When he dies in an accident , she 's released out into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her whatever she wants . She goes to New York and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder , one bed at a time . Although obviously there 's no actual sex shown , the film is quite sleazy . Unfortunately , after the initial shock value fades ( around the time Stanwyck screws a rail car inspector so she can travel for free ) , the film becomes a tad repetitive and dull . Stanwyck herself is the only thing that keeps the film worth sitting through . As always , she 's fantastic .  
  Escaping the life of being pimped by her father ( .. and the speakeasy waitressing ) who dies in an explosion , Lily Powers ( Barbara Stanwyck , who is simply ravishing ) sluts her way through the branches inside a bank business in big city Gotham . When a possessive lover murders who was supposed to be his next father-in-law ( and Lily 's new lover ) , the sky 's the limit for Lily as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety makes it known the papers will receive it if certain pay doesn't come into her hands . Newly appointed president to the bank , Courtland Trenholm ( George Brent ) , sends Lily to Paris instead of forking over lots of dough , but soon finds himself madly in love after various encounters with her in the City of Love . This makes Lily 's mouth water as now she 'll have reached the pedestal of success seducing a man of wealth and prestige bring riches her way . Though , circumstances ensue which will bring her to make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving those riches .. Trenholm , now her husband , is being indicted with jail certain and has lost the bank . He needs money Lily now has in her possession or he 'll have absolutely nothing . Stanwyck is the whole movie despite that usual Warner Brothers polish . Being set in the pre-code era gives the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy . Good direction from Alfred E Green shows through subtlety hints in different mannerisms and speech through good acting from the seductive performance of Stanwyck how to stage something without actually showing the explicit act . Obviously the film shows that money isn't everything and all that jazz as love comes into the heart of Lily 's dead heart . That ending having Lily achieve the miraculous metamorphosis into someone in love didn't ring true to me . She 's spent all this time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him .  
  After losing his cattle herd to a dishonest lawman , a trail boss winds up in the Yukon gold fields with a bad reputation and small chances of being able to return to the states . While there his fortunes take a turn for the best until a bad luck specter from the past comes calling . Good western with many favorite old faces in the lineup .  
  Ok , needless to say , this film is only going to appeal to a certain audience ; namely stoners and like-minded people . That being said , if you are one of these aformentioned people , this film is a MUST . In fact , I think it should be mandatory for head shops to sell a copy of it to anyone purchasing their first bong . What Monty Python 's Holy Grail is to geeks and nerds , so is this movie to potheads . I first saw this film 10 years ago or so , and I still crack up every time I watch it . The jokes perfectly lampoon the pothead lifestyle , far better than latter day knockoffs like Half-Baked attempt to . There isn't a plot , so to speak ; the film is more of a collection of various skits ; as the films protagonists wander around Los Angeles in their legendary haze . Despite this , the film has an excellent sense of pace , and doesn't drag at all . Many people cite Up In Smoke as C & C 's best work , but I would have to say that Next Movie is superior . So if you 're in the mood for an hour and half of belly laughs , light up , tune in , and let your mind float away = ) Oh , and FREE TOMMY CHONG !  
  This move actually had me jumping out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were going to do ! The acting was the best , Farrah should have gotten a Oscar for this she was fabulous . James Russo was so good I hated him he was the villain and played it wonderful . There aren't many movies that have riveted me as this one . The cast was great Alfie looking shocked with those big eyes Farrah looking like a victim and you re-lived her horror as she went through it . Farrah made you feel like you were there and feeling the same anger she felt you wanted her to hurt him , yet you also knew it was the wrong thing to do . The movie had you on a roller coaster ride and you went up and down with each scene .  
  After realizing what is going on around us .. in the news .. in our homes .. the whole new world .. I remembered this show and how obsessed I was watching it every week ( in my town ) .. I started looking for this series .. 3 days ago .. didn ; t have luck till this moment .. and I was shocked when I read about it and about CBS .. People , I believe they stopped the show because it 's talking about something way ahead of our understanding of the new world .. it was trying to deliver a hidden message about something terrifying .. The people who stopped it are the same who are controlling the world Now .. I remember in one of the episodes it was talking about the ONE dollar and the pyramid with the one eye ..  
  In this installment of the series , Edmund Blackadder is stuck in the Regency period in Britain ( during the later portion of George II 's rule ) . This time , Blackadder 's prospects are much poorer-as instead of royalty , he 's a servant to the very , very thick George IV ( the price regent ) . Unlike the historical accounts of George IV , this one is about as bright as a tomato and as a result , Blackadder 's able to take advantage of him and scheme to his heart 's content . The only major difference in style between this one and earlier ones is that the series ends on a very , very , very different note-you just have to see it to believe it . Other than that , all the usual story elements are there and the show is hilarious . The only reservation I have ( as always ) is that this show is not appropriate for the kids due to its crude language and adult situations .  
  I had no problem with the film , which I thought was pretty good . It 's the actual LAPD crime scene video that disturbed me . I wonder if Lion 's Gate REALLY thought that the general viewing audience would want to see people that were brutally beaten to death and blood all over the place . Sorry Lion 's Gate , this was an INCREDIBLY BAD IDEA ! Getting back to the film : The cast was excellent , especially Val Kilmer as the late John Holmes . John Holmes was a sleaze , mistreats the women in his life ( Lisa Kudrow as his wife , Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend ) , and he is hopelessly deep into drugs . His connection to Eddie Nash ( Eric Bogosian ) creates a spiral that resulted in the infamous Wonderland murders . Exactly how much was Holmes involved in the murders ? We may never know the entire truth to the story ( Nash is still alive and a free man ) , but the film does a pretty good job nonetheless .  
  Just saying you 've got a movie about John Holmes is a guarantee to get some folks in front of the screen , but writer / director James Cox delivers oh so much more . A " Rashamon " of the sleazy Hollywood set , the film splitters the July 1981 Wonderland murders through a variety of angles ( and film stocks ) , but mostly through the filter of John Holmes ' coked out weasel brain . In a film full of bad guys Holmes is either the most vile , the most pathetic or both . Several versions of the story emerge and merge as Cox flashes jump cuts and twisting title cards amid effects and emoting . The dialogue is fast and naturalistic and never once rings false . While the film takes places two years after Holmes had fallen out of porn and into a truly wicked drug fueled depravity , Kilmer relentlessly exudes a sexuality so intense it can be measured in inches . This sexuality at its edges creates a sense of foreboding that hangs over the entire film almost as heavily as the violence at its center . Those murders are teased at through the whole film though are never clearly shown , not even at the climax , though the violence of them relentlessly infuses the whole picture and much blood is splattered across walls and crime scene photos . Once again Val Kilmer as Holmes shows he can act wacko better than anyone else working . Strutting , cringing , bragging or begging , Kilmer is constantly in character and the character is constantly a fascinating car wreck . Stand out performances beside Kilmer definitely include Ted Levine as the lead cop in the investigation and Lisa Kudrow as Holmes estranged wife . The trio of criminals Holmes falls in with include the frighteningly high energy Josh Lucas , the ever interesting Timothy Blake Nelson and an absolutely unrecognizable Dylan McDermott in a pivotal role as the teller yet another version of the murders . Cox suggests that no matter how much we learn about Wonderland , there is always a worse version possible , but looking through the debauchery surrounding it is much more fascinating than understanding the truth .  
  I didn't expect Val Kilmer to make a convincing John Holmes , but I found myself forgetting that it wasn't the porn legend himself . In fact , the entire cast turned in amazing performances in this vastly under-rated movie . As some have mentioned earlier , seek out the two-disc set and watch the " Wadd " documentary first ; it will give you a lot of background on the story which will be helpful in appreciating the movie . Some people seem unhappy about the LAPD crime scene video being included on the DVD . There are a number of reasons that it might have been included , one of which is that John Holmes ' trial for the murders was the first ever in the United States where such footage was used by the prosecution . If you don't want to see it , it 's easy to avoid ; it 's clearly identified as " LAPD Crime Scene Footage " on the menu !  
  A wonderful early musical film from Rene Clair , as fun and witty as his silent " The Italian Straw Hat " . Using sound in a expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects , Clair influenced early musicals in America ( the opera scene from A Night at the Opera is strongly influenced by Le Million , for example ) . Should ( but won't ) be seen by all cinephiles , and the DVD from Criterion is exactly as good as you 'd expect . There 's not a ton of extras , but most DVD extras I 've seen are useless fluff , and the Clair interview on disc is one I hadn't ever seen . Get it while it 's still around .  
  I 'm gonna tip the scales here a bit and say I enjoyed this . However , the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies . It 's definitely something that most people will not get , as is the nature of absurdism . the animation is horrible , but yes , that 's the point . The main character is foul mouthed , violent , and stupid . no redeeming qualities whatsoever . his wife shrieks and wails , apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills . most of these stories completely lack any kind of point . but again , that 's the point ; ) If non sequiters , foul language , and complete and utter randomness are your thing , you 're going to love this . It is really short , so I would probably rent instead of buying .  
  * 1/2 Out of * While I am not concerned with the fact that this is an English dubbed version as some reviewers have mentioned , it should be noted , as it seems to reside in many Quebecois native hearts . However , this was a movie as a child that I was a fervent admirer of ; keeping in mind now that it was made for children , I rate it on a relative basis . The story is of children on winter break building an awesome snow fort , and jostling back-'n-forth for control with weapons such as snowballs and other concoctions , as idle hands and free time equal winter break lessons . If I had children , this definitely is a film I would try and get them interested in , as the snow fort wowed me when I was young , and I think even children today would agree , albeit with Pixar and all the computer animation , maybe I am out of date and just don't realize it . In addition , the movie 's message is wonderfully allegorical and a positive one at that , for children ( and adults alike ) .  
  Will all of you please lay the hell off Todd Sheets ! ? ! Let 's give you $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what you come up with ! The guy got 735 zombies and a regular cast to work for FREE ! Sure the acting is laughable at times . Yes the make-up is not greatest you 'll ever see . But it 's not the worst either , if you want to see that , go watch Zombie Nation with it 's raccoon zombies . This is pure , good old fashioned Guerilla Film-making ! Todd is a consummate professional , and an all around nice guy . There are holes in the plot , yes . The plot does seem far-fetched . But what the hell , I still love this movie . I wish Todd Sheets would come out of hiding and do the remake of this that he was going to . If anyone has ever tried to make a movie , they know that just finishing it , is an achievement in and of itself .  
  A meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that long ago used to terrorize the area around Crater Lake . As the monster eats the locals they try and find away of killing the monster . Recent attempts at sending up old horror and science fiction films like Lost Skeleton of Cadavra and Alien Trespass are kind of rendered moot when you have films like Crater Lake Monster available for screening . It 's the sort of film that those films spoof and send up only this is the real deal . Its everything those films try to be only with out the tongue in cheek and its so much more fun because of it . This is a real drive-in sort of film that had the unfortunate luck of coming just as Star Wars changed the way we look at special effects . The monster , a mix of stop motion and a life size head , is a charmingly quaint little beast . The filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its mayhem . Sure its clear that its all fake , but isn't movies about suspension of disbelief ? Actually I think its about really cool monsters , which this has . I like this movie in a low budget drive in sort of a way . If you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no farther . This would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films ( Boggy Creek etc . )  
  Michael Is King . This film contains some of the best stuff Mike has ever done . Smooth Criminal is pure genius . The cameos are wonderful , but as always , the main event is MJ himself . He is the best , hands down .  
  This movie is my all time favorite ! You really have to see Michael Jackson in this wonderful film ! I 'm always over the moon , watching it ! This is a film , that you really have to see , also if you aren't a MJ Fan , cause this film writes , like Captain EO , E.T. and Ghosts , a bit of Film and music History ! This wonderful film , out of Michael 's feather , is a must have ! And : Smooth Criminal , is really the most wonderful , exciting and amazing song I 've ever heard in my life ! Thank you Michael for this film and I love you ! MJ 's the best musician to hit this planet , he 's a fine man and he always brings sparkles in your eyes , when you listen to his music ! Please , if you don't know this film , watch it and don't miss it , because would be too bad for yourself if you 'd miss it ! - Highly Recommanded film , for every movie lover -  
  I have to say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen ! I was bored and looked through the t . v . and found " Home Room " and it was already in about 5 min . , but I got hooked . It was so interesting and moving . It shows what can happen in anyone 's life . I give it a 10 , more if possible . The director / writer and actors did an amazing job . I think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it . It was great , drama , mystery , and more . I cried for hours ! I think that the director / writer should write more movies like this one . I loved it ! I didn't even know about this movie , which is sad because it was so good . I wish it could go in the movies for more people to see .  
  Michael Jackson is not very popular in USA anymore , however in Europe ( especially Germany ) he has still got lots of fans . Many will say that this is a bad movie , and it is : it has no plot , it 's full of cliches , Michael praises himself constantly . BUT , you can't expect a plot or non-cliches in this kind of movie ! It has entertaining visual effects and the music is perfect . The Smooth Criminal fragment - the greatest song ever , full of Moonwalks , group dance acts and even the famous " Michael Jackson 's Bench-over " - makes this film one of Jackson 's masterpieces with an even good-looking ( and white .. ) Michael Jackson ! A must for Jackson fans , a must for music fans , a must for dance act fans . However , as I 'm an MJ fan , I should warn all Michael Jackson haters out there : DON'T watch this movie , you 'd only make your hate increase ..  
  This is , in my opinion , a very good film , especially for Michael Jackson lovers . It contains a message on drugs , stunning special effects , and an awesome music video . The main film is centered around the song and music video ' Smooth Criminal . ' Unlike the four-minute music video , it is normal speed and , in my opinion , much easier to watch . The plot is rather weird , however . Michael Jackson plays a magical ' gangster ' that , when he sees a shooting star , he transforms into a piece of machinery . Throughout the film , he transforms into a race car , a giant robot , and a space ship . The robot scene in particular is a bit drawn out and strange . I found it a little out-of-whack compared to the rest of the film . A child is kidnapped , Michael tries to save her , is tortured and beaten , and suddenly turns into a giant robot that blows up all the bad guys . A little weird ? Yeah . But besides the bizarre robot scene , it 's a very good movie , and any Michael Jackson fan will enjoy both the Smooth Criminal music video and the movie .  
  I loved this movie . It is rare to get a glimpse of post-partum Vietnam , and this movie-sans combat scenes and exciting bombs and gunfire - did it . I had no idea I 'd be so affected by it . What an amazing look at how alien Vets feel . It was tough to watch , quite frankly . We all understand the fighting and the Apocalypse Now type of drama , but this is so so different . What happens when they come back and try to live a life ? They can't . It made me very aware of a large group of men that are rattling around lost in America . Not able to relate , can't sleep , can't have love affairs , can't deal with " normal society " . They feel totally apart . This is a huge tragedy , and one that isn't addressed enough . Yeah , we 've changed our attitude about Vietnam Vets , we like them now , but so what ? It doesn't seem to have made any difference to them . It 's too late ? So it was a great film , but I cried a lot . I have no other criticisms .  
  Sorry to say I have no idea what Hollywood is doing . Sure give us movies like Batman Begins . Oh , by the way Hollywood I think they may cover the story line in the movie Batman , but please don't entertain us what we would really want to see Batman and Superman together . I really hated this trailer because it left me wanting for more . I was looking around to see when it was coming out . It was like a terrible practical joke . The graphics where good the story line seemed solid and it had all the trappings of a great movie . Unfortunately it 's not going to happen for now . To the producers , directors and all the actors great job but I hate you for doing this to me . You left me wanting more .  
  Kristine Watts ( Molie Weeks ) is broken apart , missing her lover ; she is not able to overcome her love for him that is lost in the past . She hires a stranger ( Douglas Davis ) and gives a list of her mistakes to him with things to fix . But time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for the pain is a tragic end . The first point that impresses in " The Cure " is the stylish cinematography that alternates black and white with color . The concise and sharp screenplay is capable to develop a tragic and bleak tale of love with an unexpected plot point in the very end in less than eight minutes . The soundtrack is beautiful but the volume is a little loud and associated to the fact that English is not my native language , in some moments I needed to repeat some words whispered by the narrator . The unknown lead actress has magnificent performance and is extremely gorgeous . I hope to have a chance to see her again on the screen . Last but not the least , the debut of the director and writer Ryan Jafri could not be better . My vote is nine . Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available  
  I have to start by telling you how I came across this movie . It was winter time in Alaska around the year 1990 . A friend of mine from Australia was staying with me and my girl friend in a shoe box of an apartment . Winters in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors , drink heavily and watch anything that comes on the television . I had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away new it was a treasure . It is quite possibly the best worst movie ever . We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish . We watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full filling effect . It is a true gem . The laughs will come nonstop and the memories last forever . If you see this movie for rent in a video store , steal it . You won't regret it !  
  .. or was Honest Iago actually smirking at the end , as he died ? Loved how the Bard 's iambic pentameter just rolled of Fishburne 's tongue , with excellent clarity and emotion . And how Branagh made Honest Iago seem to celebrate his own evilness .. This is a wonderful film . I have often thought that Shakespeare is inherently not film-friendly : He uses words to create pictures in our minds , which creates a perennial battle with the camera , which only knows to show us what we need to think and feel . Every effort to film Shakespeare ought really to be celebrated . It is not an easy thing to do .  
  Brian Dennehy , Bill Paxton , Joe Pantalino and , best of all , Jeff Fahey , all in one film . Wow is all I can think to say about that . These are four of the most underrated actors in the biz and they work beautifully together . It 's like poetry the way they play off each other and ooze the natural ability to seem as though they had been best buddies for eons for even shooting the film . The film itself is fine and one that can be quite intense to view the first time , and the four stars help the re-watch-ability to a great extent . I cannot describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey together on screen , the greatest moment being when they watch a couple from a distance and fill in the vocals themselves , it almost brought a tear to my eyes . A good film , a great cast , go see . Why ? Four words , Fahey , Dennehy , Paxton , Pantalino .  
  This is a really funny ( and sexy ) movie - that is not just silly but has great acting . It 's the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel like you are connected to everyone in the theater . I saw it at the Boston film festival , and I found myself frequently laughing out loud with everyone else , and also moved by some of the movie 's more serious parts . It 's a unique movie about two doctors , and I don't want to give anything away but there are some powerful scenes as well really funny ones - plus the dialogue is great . Wood Harris ' character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana , and Brian White and Mya are also funny and sexy in their roles . If you get a chance to see it - go - you won't be disappointed . It 's worth seeing again . Wood Harris deserves an award .  
  A great movie . Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect , the songs are wonderful , the dances , with a particular mention for the " Portobello Ballet " are gorgeous . As for the animated section , the match between animals has become an instant classic ; the climax with the attack of the armatures is chilling and fascinating . I recommend to see the restored 134 minutes version or at least the 112 minutes video . Here in Italy we have only the 98 minutes version , although the film was presented in its original release at the running of 117 minutes . If possible , watch also the German videocassette : it was generated from the 98 minutes running but it 's missing of every refer to World War II and of all the scenes between English people and their Nazi invaders !  
  Yes , some plots are a bit hard to follow , and The Bill does have a tendency to get violent , but it is actually an engrossing show , that I try not to miss . A vast majority of the episodes are very exciting and quite tense , and the acting is fairly good , though I do miss Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent . I will admit , I prefer the older episodes to the newer episodes , and it is a bit of a shame that the programme is now after the watershed , as I found it easier to watch when it was at 8.00 . Still , why I like The Bill is because not only it is engrossing , but the cliffhangers at the end do make the next episode unmissable . It is true though , that it is more melodramatic than it was , but I really like this programme as a programme that doesn't try to take itself too seriously . 8/10 Bethany Cox  
  It 's good to see that Vintage Film Buff have correctly categorized their excellent DVD release as a " musical " , for that 's what this film is , pure and simple . Like its unofficial remake , Murder at the Windmill ( 1949 ) , the murder plot is just an excuse for an elaborate girlie show with Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael leading a cast of super-decorative girls including Ann Sheridan , Lucy Ball , Beryl Wallace , Gwenllian Gill , Gladys Young , Barbara Fritchie , Wanda Perry and Dorothy White . Carl Brisson is also on hand to lend his strong voice to " Cocktails for Two " . Undoubtedly the movie 's most popular song , it is heard no less than four times . However , it 's Gertrude Michael who steals the show , not only with her rendition of " Sweet Marijauna " but her strong performance as the hero 's rejected girlfriend . As for the rest of the cast , we could have done without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen altogether . The only good thing about Oakie 's role is his weak running gag with cult icon , Toby Wing . In fact , to give you an idea as to how far the rest of the comedy is over-indulged and over-strained , super-dumb Inspector McLaglen simply cannot put his hands on the killer even though , would you believe , in this instance it happens to be the person you most suspect . Director Mitch Leisen actually goes to great pains to point the killer out to even the dumbest member of the cinema audience by giving the player concerned close-up after close-up .  
  Of course , the story line for this movie isn't the best , but the dances are wonderful . This story line is different from other Astaire-Rogers movies in that neither one is " chasing " the other . The dancing of Fred and Ginger is what makes this movie .  
  One of several musicals about sailors on leave , it is the usual sailor meets girl , complications ensue , sorted out happily kind of plot . It proceeds along smoothly enough but it does drag in places too . The dialogue is not as zippy as ' Top Hat ' for example and Randolph Scott seems out of place . There are compensations . It has some of Irving Berlin 's choicest songs including ' Let Yourself Go ' , ' I 'm Putting all My Eggs in One Basket ' and ' Let 's Face the Music and Dance ' . It has Fred and Ginger who when they are dancing take any film into heavenly heights and they don't disappoint here . They do a snappy tap dance , a knockabout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance , all in the same film ! Great versatility and artistry . It also has Harriet Hilliard who is rather good in her role . She had a varied career , becoming the more famous Harriet Nelson with Ozzie . Here she is touching without being sentimental . Her two songs are simply and effectively delivered . She makes a good contrast with Ginger but you can believe they are sisters in the film . More tightening up have made the film even better . Pretty good though .  
  This film show peoples in the middle of the hottest 2 days in Austria . It shows people humiliating other peoples and being cruel to other peoples . It show the inability of people to communicate or talk with others . In the screening I have attended people were leaving in the middle because they could no longer watch the film . And rightly so . Because the film is not and easy one to watch . It has a very depressing message and there isn't any moment of mercy in the film . It is a very cruel movie , not for everyone 's taste . You can not speak of terms of enjoyment from this film . It grips you in your throat and never let go and in the end you simply feels breathless because of its intensity . I can not " recommend " or " not recommend " this film . You should make your own mind based on what I have said earlier . Just be aware that this is not a regular film and it is not for everyone 's taste .  
  Nick and Kelly are ready to be married but Travis ( Kelly 's dog ) leads Nick to a strange blue wall that will change the honeymoon for Kelly . Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make a good couple . Nick loves to drink , smoke , and play pool with the fellas for fun but Nick suddenly abstains from this type of fun . Sex is the one thing that he loves because he wants a child . We find out that an alien race is dying and needs to interbreed with women from Earth to save their population . It becomes a battle of survival between humans and aliens with the dog population also being involved . A fine film .  
  Weak , fast and multicolor , this is the Valvoline 's movie in fact you can see always this brand of oil in a lot of scene . The real protagonist are the cars , weak performances of Cage and Duvall . A intresting Angelina Jolie is a unlikely mechanic . For the lovers of dream car ( LAMBORGHINI and FERRARI over all ) .  
  This episode of Twilight Zone combines a silent section ( 1890 ) with melodramatic acting and sight gags , an homage to the early Buster Keaton films . Lots of slapstick : Buster falling on a bulkhead door , falling in a puddle , running around pants-less . Silly scientist 's invention of a Time Helmet , reminiscent of a Flash Gordon idea of what the future would be . Cheap prices , like $ 1.95 for ladies hats , or 17 cents a pound for beef seem outrageously high to Buster . Even the world of 1890 is too much for Buster / Mulligan . How shocking when he is mistakenly transported to the " modern " world of 1960 ! Buster was trying to go backwards ! The " scientist " of that time wants to return to a calmer world , the 1890 that he has studied and admired . They go back together , and Buster / Mulligan is now happy and the " scientist " regrets not having electronic equipment , modern beds or an electric blanket . So Buster sends him back with the crazy helmet . This Twilight Zone doesn't have a heavy message . Since Buster Keaton died in 1966 , it is one of his last efforts . That 's enough . One other cute thing-longtime underutilized Maytag Man Jesse White is a repairman who fixes the Time Helmet-foreshadowing his washing machine career .  
  me and my sister saw the premiere last night .. it was so good we were glued for the whole thing .. hahaha .. i think I 'm hooked for the season ! .. they have some really good actors in this thing .. the head coach guy and the player that likes pete were very good and the plot has already got me but i don't really understand how they 'll keep it stretched for a whole season .. there will probably be some big twist tho .. i cant wait till Tuesday .. finally Jeremy sumpter who is he ? i can tell hes going to be big ! he was soo good we fell in love with his character right away .. cant wait for the next episode .. GO Jeremy ! ' Aimee  
  I 'm certainly glad that a film was made about Carl Brashear 's amazing life story . Coming as it did during the Civil Rights era , Brashear became an inspiration for people of all minority groups not willing to settle for a status expected . Brashear as played by Cuba Gooding , Jr . leads by example in the conduct of the life he has chosen . Very similar to Jackie Robinson who integrated baseball and made it stick by his character and conduct . As Brashear , Gooding knows that he does not want the sharecropper life that his father Carl Lumbly has and Lumbly makes it real clear to get more out of life than he 's gotten . But while Harry Truman integrated the Armed Services after World War II , the Navy still has its restrictions . A black man can only be a cook or an officer 's valet , the real fighting parts are denied him . That 's not good enough for Gooding who applies to become a Navy deep sea diver . Once at the diving school at Bayonne , New Jersey , Gooding gets it all thrown at him , mostly by the Master Chief Petty Officer in charge , Robert DeNiro . DeNiro may have some leftover prejudices , but he 's nevertheless a hero and one who can inspire if one can get passed racial divide . The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding . They certainly come from different places , but as they get to know each other , both turn out to be Men Of Honor . Other good performances to note are Charlize Theron as DeNiro 's wife and Hal Holbrook as the head of the diving school , a guy the Navy just wish would retire for reasons you 'll see . Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change .  
  Robert De Niro , Cuba Gooding Jr . , Hal Holbrook , and all the rest of the actors and actresses in " Men of Honour " have combined to make this a fine movie . Mark Isham wrote the filmscore , so you know the music is truly fine , too . But : After noticing a slew of goofs , loopholes , and over-dramatic heart-string pluckings right from the start , I had to make a vow to ignore them and sit back to enjoy the film . If you can do that , it _ really_is _ good . The story of Carl Brashear , a true-to-life hero , is inspirational enough to last a lifetime . Look him up on the internet .. The entire story is more amazing than the film , as the Director admitted in his comments . There were only three African-American U.S. Navy divers in World War II . However , none reached the status of U.S. Navy Master Diver . Carl Brashear was THE first African-American U.S. Navy Master Diver . AND he was the first amputee diver to ever be certified or recertified as a U.S. Navy diver . ( Resounding Applause ) . On the negative side of the movie 's ledger : Should I tell you of only one of the many " loopholes " ? Yeah , I 'll mark this comment as containing " spoilers " and do so .. The early , pivotal scene where the helicopter hits the radio mast and sinks into the sea : They 'd never have had the time to suit up a full Mark V diver , even if he were the legendary Master Chief Billy Sunday , in time to be only " .. a couple of minutes late " saving the pilot . So , for loopholes , goofs , and over-dramatization , I derated " Men of Honor " from a perfect 10 down to a 7 . Will Hollywood EVER realize that the unalloyed truth is so much better that their over-dramatic approach to story-telling ? I doubt it . Too bad !  
  It is a superb Swedish film .. it was the first Swedish film I 've seen .. it is simple & deep .. what a great combination ! . Michael Nyqvist did a great performance as a famous conductor who seeks peace in his hometown . Frida Hallgren was great as his inspirational girlfriend to help him to carry on & never give up . The fight between the conductor and the hypocrite priest who loses his battle with Michael when his wife confronts him And defends Michael 's noble cause to help his hometown people finding their own peace in music . The only thing that I didn't like was the ending .. it wasn't that good but it has some deep meaning .  
  Kay Pollak 's 2004 heart-warmer Så som i himmelen / As it is in Heaven contains every stereotype of Swedish humanity and inhumanity yet manages to be a crowd-pleaser . It contains plenty of ammunition for cynical critics , continuity error-spotters and for saccharine-debunkers , yet manages to depict the colours of life in a small community evocatively . The film also runs the gamut of proverbial messages about ' finding one 's own voice ' and ' just doing it despite one 's fear ' , without completely removing the lump from the throats of the cynics . Its success as a crowd pleaser comes from two facts . Firstly , small films about strangers bringing new life to rural Christian communities provide plenty of scope for the exposure of hypocrisy while at the same time allowing repressed characters to break out of their hairshirts . The same year and with a similarly Swedish breeze , The Queen of Sheba 's Pearls did it , and Babette 's Feast also comes to mind . Secondly , any film about small communities taking on the whole wide world will strike a human chord in our increasingly individual / self - focused and impersonalized world . This film 's structural similarity with the likes of The Full Monty , Brassed Off , Calendar Girls and On a Clear Day shows its indebtedness to the formula . But it is a formula with life left in it yet , and this seems to be because people need positive - message films that evoke a sense of community almost in spite of themselves . The stranger is burned-out maestro Daniel Daréus on a quest for self-rediscovery . The town he visits , or rather revisits , is , unbeknownst to the townsfolk , the place of his childhood . He was bullied mercilessly by classmates here , supposedly because he was a sensitive musician without aspiration to drive a truck . Here , he takes the job of cantor / choirmaster , despite the usual suspicions of artists and outsiders . The place is , of course , populated by a wide range of recognizable types whose character arcs can be predicted : the broken-hearted , fair-haired girl so beautiful she nearly glows ; the cellphone-ringing local businessman ; the woman whose beauty is lost amidst domestic abuse ; the steely pastor and his less austere wife , who at first seem right out of Ingmar Bergman . Also present : jealous , uptight spinster ( Siv ) ( check ) ; geriatric whose soul still sings ( check ) ; elderly couple who may have repressed desires for each other since kindergarten ( check ) ; obese person whose function is to point out we should not laugh and say ' fatty ' ( check ) ; intellectually handicapped boy who proves able to sing a good ' A ' ( check ) . Pollak 's film is not all warm fuzzies , however . It diverts from the ' let 's put on a show despite setbacks and moral opposition ' sub-genre . It contains violence and an ending that might well be a metaphor for dying after achieving creative nirvana . The violence of the film is mostly a function of male anger and repression , but in never delves deeply into why the school bully who grows up into a wife beater is like this . Similarly , the small town Pastor so closely adheres to the moralistic , black-wearing super-Protestant stereotype , that his secret indulgence in girlie magazines is hardly surprising . His repressions and hypocrisies are just there , dangling unrelated to psychological reality . Perhaps the unexplained photograph of a young boy , a lost son perhaps , glimpsed once over his shoulder , holds the secret . Perhaps these holes are functions of the editing , like several inconsistencies and continuity glitches that can be spotted , such as Siv 's unexplained reappearance in the choir ( twice ) after moralistic outbursts . In fact none of the hitches in the film last very long and all seem resolved within a scene . Apart from in some awkward love scenes , the film 's 127 minutes seldom drag , but there is a feeling that things may have been left on the cutting room floor . The film remains solid three-star-fare despite the holes that can be picked in it . This is simply because in a world of technology-focused flicks and materialistic self-seeking , any glimpse of human community is , deep down , welcome for anyone , even the cynical .  
  This is what we can do to each other . This is the sort that everbody should see at least once . It does not glorify world . It shows that it is the everyday person who is killed , mained and debased by war . The person on the " other side " eats sleeps , laughs and cry just as we do .  
  War is hell . But this documentary of WWII is heaven . Not only is this series a breath-taking , almost-exhaustive look at the Second World War , it 's a poetic masterpiece told clearly and superbly by Laurence Olivier . This documentary series defines the genre . It 's sweepingly long , no doubt , but you will enjoy all of them and want to come back for more and more . ( I have the series on DVD and I probably watch the series three times a year ) . Truly , this is an impeccable bit of film-making . Other than Olivier , the best part of the series is listening to the veterans tell their stories ; whether it be about an actual battle or about finding a hog to butcher so they could have something delicious for supper . I 'm going to go watch it right now ( again , my .. 11th time ) .  
  I must have seen this a dozen times over the years . I was about fifteen when I first saw it in B & W on the local PBS station . I bought a DVD set for the children to see , and am making them watch it . They don't teach history in School , and this explains the most critical event of the 20th Century . It expands their critical thinking . Impartially , with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why , it details what lead up to the war and the actual war . Buy it for your children , along with Alistair Cooke 's America . Watch it with them , and make them understand . You 'll be so glad you did .  
  This series , produced at probably the most propitious time following the events of the second World War , is on a scale of value that stands far above any individual 's presumption to criticize . The timing of World at War 's production in 1974 , amounting to some three decades after the events of the war , permits an accurate relating of events in a manner uncoloured by residual propaganda and slant . The passage of thirty years allows the telling to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the very individuals involved , ranging from some of the highest military and political figures down to the field soldiers , civilians , and such survivors of the death camps as have remained to bear witness to the unimaginable inhumanities of which civilized humans are capable . Most approaching or well into their senior years , the interviewed subjects have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most instances have had enough time for whatever propaganda and fervor may have affected them in the past to have receded away , leaving only the memories of what they saw and what they did . The information that these survivors give , strikingly reinforced by the postures and expressions they display while telling their part , give their stories all the more impact . Such names as Ira Eaker , Adolph Galland , Louis Mountbatten , Albert Speer , Gertrude Junge ( Hitler 's personal secretary ) .. the list is far too long to relate . Today , within the lifetime of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the hideous price of political ambition , are young people who chant the same sort of militaristic and nationalistic war promotion as led to WW2 . The DVD series we discuss here ought to comprise the core of a mandatory history subject in schools , that the lessons bought at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted but should be taken to heart by those who did not see firsthand the terrible price . I am almost done watching the 11 disk set , having seen most of the series when a local TV channel aired it more than 10 years ago . It has lost none of its poignancy to me , indeed has become even more of a magnificent chronicle of some of the very darkest days of human times . The highest possible rating seems unworthy of being applied to this presentation . I think the value of this series is beyond counting .  
  I almost didn't rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyways . I thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked . The only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station . They were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy . It ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary . The rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be . The make-up was good and I have seen way worse movies then this one . It was a simple story with believable acting . It 's not the scariest or goriest movie , but I wasn't ticked off or wanting a refund after watching it . On the DVD there was previews of other movies that all look good and i 'm gonna check them out .  
  During the whole Pirates of The Caribbean Trilogy Craze Paramount Pictures really dropped the ball in restoring this Anthony Quinn directed Cecil B . DeMille supervised movie and getting it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the extras included . It is obvious to me that Paramount Pictures Execs are blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in New Orleans , Louisiana which would have helped make The Crescent City once again famous for it 's Pirate Connections . When the Execs at Paramount finally get with the program and release this movie in digital format then I will be a happy camper . Paramount Pictures it is up to you to get off your duff and get this film restored now !  
  Usually I don't really like Emma Roberts so much , but after watching Nancy Drew it kind of changed my mind . The actors in the movies made the whole thing exciting and funny . Most of the time when you watch a mystery movie you can solve it before the middle of the show , but in this movie it 's like you are actually there . The clues have to all fit together until you can finally understand the whole crime . I am still amazed how she found it out . The whole movie was really clever and the people who watched it with me loved the movie too . The clothes were my favorite part of the movie , it was so cute . I don't think there will be another movie like this until the sequel comes out . I give it a nine because the popular girls didn't really seem to have the part just right , but they still make me laugh . It was a really great movie and a great mystery . I definitely recommend watching it .  
  Of all the reviews I 've read , most people have been exceedingly hard on Alexandre . Neither Marie or Veronika ever seemed that they would particularly desperate to keep Alexandre , he being only slightly intelligent though not at all intellectual , as most of us are , however hard it may be for anyone to admit . Alexandre is getting away with life perfectly , being totally taken care of , getting and giving what he wants . the girls are allowing this , veronika loves sex , marie is his patron . is there anything wrong with any of this ? is anyone in love ? really ? i don't think so . Though French New Wave cinema is prone to pretension and so on , it is marvelous simply because of its lack of a need for a plot in order to create emotion . Ease is perfectly lovely and all anyone in Alexandre 's position , in an urban area can ask for . I 'm looking for a patron , anyone interested ?  
  One of my favorite films for a number of years was " Last Action Hero " ; unfortunately , Arnold Schwarznegger decided to spoil my fun by becoming a corrupt scumbag politician ; so now I can't bear any film he may had a hand in . The Adventures of Jake Speed actually toys with some themes similar to those in Last .. Hero ; so I was pleased to find it on DVD , so I could watch these themes played out so well . Despite the " plot within the plot " involving white slavery during an African nation 's civil war , this is not an action movie . The plot that the " plot within a plot " is within , is actually about a question that the film has no intention to resolve : Is Jake Speed a real person that is helping the heroine save her sister from the white-slave trader ; or is he actually a fictional character ( which means that the heroine has somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of pulp novels ) ? I suggest that this is not all that clearly defined in the film , and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are perfectly aware of this . The film thus becomes a presentation of what audiences may want from such a fictional " adventure-story " universe . That 's actually a rich theme , the potential heaviness of which is lightened by the film 's amiable and campy sense of humor . There are weaknesses to the film - primarily it 's cinematography , which makes the film look like a TV show . And the pacing does sag on occasion . But I really like these characters , and I enjoy the adventure they live , however silly . And I just find fascinating the idea that this adventure is actually taking place in a novel . Holds up under multiple viewings -m good show !  
  I have no idea how to describe this movie , and also would love to provide others the same opportunity I had - seeing it with no prior knowledge of what to expect . I enjoyed it immensely but can also say I barely understood what was going on , if in fact there was anything to understand in the first place . Fans of David Lynch ( tangentially ) or especially Guy Maddin films should particularly enjoy this , and any fans of the comic book EIGHTBALL will probably be beside themselves with joy and wonder ( it came as close as any film I 've seen to the tone and mood Dan Clowes creates so effectively ) . One slight note just to warn anyone easily offended - this movie , if rated , would be NC-17 for sure . Fans of male full-frontal nudity , however .. hmm , well .. yes . This is weird wild stuff .  
  What I love about this show is that it follows the lives of modern witches and it 's a blast to experience their everyday love , humor and adventure . The literature of magic is so diverse , portraying the ideas of classical , medieval and modern wizardry , like Harry Potter and Sabrina . With Sabrina the Teenage Witch , this show is so fun and unique because it lets us experience a lot of that modern wizardry , seven seasons worth ! This show has so many great qualities and it 's a joy to watch Sabrina live her daily life in the mortal and " other " realm . I would recommend this to any family because the television series is clean , funny and adventurous . Classic !  
  I remember seeing this when it was released , in a theater in Palo Alto , and not expecting much . I mean - an Australian movie ? But it finally got to me . Here 's a scene . Richard Chamberlain is sitting cross legged on the floor of a shabby apartment in Sidney , facing an Australian aborigine elder named Charlie . Chamberlain : " You were outside my house last night . You frightened my wife . Who are you ? " And Charlie at a deliberate pace replies , " Who are you ? Who are you ? Who are you ? Who are you ? Who are you ? . . . . Are you a fish ? Are you a snake ? Are you a man ? . . . . Who are you ? Who are you ? Who are you ? " It 's a stunning scene , shot all in close ups , with Chamberlain 's blandly handsome face filling the screen in opposition to Charlie 's black , broad-nosed , bearded visage . The two guys couldn't be more different and this film is the story of how Chamberlain accidentally stumbles from his humdrum lawyerly existence into the inexplicable , almost unspeakable , mysteries of Charlie 's world . I don't think I 'll go on much about the plot . It 's kind of an apocalyptic tale . But I must say , whoever did the research on Australian aboriginal belief systems should get an A plus . They 've got everything in here , from pointing the bone to the dream time , a kind of parallel universe in which dreams are real . It 's an extremely spooky movie without any musical stings or splendiferous special effects . Charly 's world simply begins to intrude into Chamberlain 's dreams , for reasons never made entirely clear . If there 's a problem with the script , that 's it . Nothing is ever made entirely clear . Does Chamberlain , who seems to have some extraordinary rapport with the aborigines , die in the last wave ? Do the aborigines ? Does the entirety of Sidney ? The basic premise is a little hard to accept too , though granted that this is a fantasy . The aborigines are invested with the kind of spiritual power that Americans bestow on American Indians , whereas the fact is that mythology is mythology and while one may be more complex or satisfying - more elegant and beautiful , if you like - mythology is still an attempt to transcend an ordinary , demanding , and sometimes disappointing physical existence . The mysticism of Charlie is more convincing that the miracles of Moses in Cecil B . DeMille 's " The Ten Commandments , " but they 're brothers under the skin . But I don't care about that . Taken as a film , this one is pretty good , and it 's especially important for marking the celebrity of the director , Peter Weir , and the Australian film industry . This was the first of a great wave of films from the antipodes , some of them raucous , like " Mad Max , " and some subtle and dramatic , like " Lantana . " I like Weir 's stuff , which resembles Nicholas Roeg 's in being pregnant with subliminal dread . Try " Picnic at Hanging Rock " for an example of how to make a truly chilling movie with not a drop of blood .  
  I stumbled upon this movie on cable and was totally hooked . The story of a group of surfers who ride the big waves , waves that are monstrously huge , waves that would make any rational person run away in terror is a one that manages to be spectacular and make you understand why people spend their lives chasing waves . There is nothing special about the film , other than it brings together some very interesting people who are are in love with what they do and lets them talk . Sure there are scenes of them surfing , but what makes this movie so special is the people . Here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that it crosses over to the people watching . Half way into this movie you 'll want to go off and learn to surf as well . Few documentaries have ever managed to covey the passion that these people have and its the films ability to make us feel it that makes this a great film . See it .  
  Though derivative , " Labyrinth " still stands as the highlight of the mid-half of the six-year-old show . Finally a story allows Welling to show how he has grown as an actor . It 's not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of " truth , justice , and the American way " on a weekly basis with very little variation . His performance , permitting him to show how one might react if he / she discovers that all that he knew may be a lie , was quite believable . Welling rose to the occasion marvelously . As always , Michael Rosenbaum , as the " handicapped " Lex , delivered , as did Kristen Kreuk as a too sweet to be believed Lana . Allison Mack , the ever-present Chloe , also scored as a slightly " off-her-rocker " version . The use of an annoying hum in the background added to the tone of the installment and made for an engaging drama .  
  Richard Chamberlain is David Burton , a tax lawyer living in Sydney , Australia who is drawn into a murder trial defending five Aboriginal men accused of murdering a fellow native in Peter Weir 's apocalyptic 1977 thriller The Last Wave . Taking up where Picnic at Hanging Rock left off , the film goes deeper into exploring the unknown and , in the process , shows the gulf between two cultures who live side by side but lack understanding of each others culture and traditions . Weir shows how white society considers the native beliefs to be primitive superstitions and believes that since they are living in the cities and have been " domesticated " , their tribal laws and culture no longer apply . From the start , Burton is drawn deeper and deeper into a strange web of visions and symbols where the line between real time and " dream time " evaporates . Water plays an important symbolic role in the film from the opening sequence in which a sudden thunder and hailstorm interrupts a peaceful school recess to Burton 's discovery that his bathtub is overflowing and water is pouring down his steps . As violent and unusual weather continue with episodes of black rain and mud falling from the sky , the contrast between the facile scientific explanations of the phenomenon and the intuitive understanding of the natives is made clear . Burton and his wife Annie ( Olivia Hamnet ) study books about the Aborigines and learn about the role of dreams in the tribal traditions . When he invites one of his clients Chris Lee ( David Gulpilil ) to his home for dinner , he is disturbed to find that he is the subject of an inquiry by Chris and his friend Charlie ( Nadjiwarra Amagula ) , an enigmatic Aborigine sorcerer involved with the defendants . As Burton 's investigation continues , his clients make his work difficult by refusing to disclose the true events surrounding the murder . After Chris starts to appear in his dreams , Burton is convinced that the Aborigine was killed in a tribal ritual because " he saw too much " , though Chris refuses to acknowledge this in court . Burton , becoming more and more troubled by a mystery he cannot unravel , says to his stepfather priest , " Why didn't you tell me there were mysteries ? " This is a legitimate question but , according to the reverend , the Church answers all mysteries . Burton knows now that he must discover the truth for himself and enters the tribal underground caves . Though we do not know for certain what is real and what is a dream , he comes face to face with his deepest fears in a haunting climax that will leave you pondering its meaning into the wee hours of the morning . In this period of history in which native Hopi and Mayan prophecies predict the " end of history " and the purification of man leading to the Fifth World , The Last Wave , though 25 years old , is still timely . The Aborigines are portrayed as a vibrant culture , not one completely subjugated by the white man , yet I am troubled by the gnawing feeling that we are looking in but not quite seeing . Weir has opened our eyes to the mystery that lies beyond our consensual view of reality , but he perpetuates the doom-orientation that sees possibility only in terms of fear , showing nature as a dark and uncontrollable power without a hint of the spiritual beauty that lives on both sides of time .  
  This movie contains one of Richard Dreyfuss 's greatest performances , as an actor who plays a dictator and does it so convincingly that his own mother does not detect the impostor . Also , this movie is funny , yet has a serious side as well . What is especially intriguing about this movie is the character Madonna , who is the dictator 's mistress , but eventually becomes the leader of the country . Madonna 's evolution from mistress to political leader added greatly to the quality of the story and to the movie 's entertainment value . And the main character , who at the start of the movie is a struggling actor and somewhat of a buffoon , evolves too and by the end of the movie commands respect . I liked this movie .  
  Saw this flick on ENCW last nite for the third or fourth time . Enjoyed it so much I ordered the DVD . This really is a standout and of course the first of the Mann-Stewart pairings . More here than the usual oater , although not quite as powerful as The Searchers . Lots of obvious symbolism about achieving manhood but mainly it 's the acting by Stewart , his partner Millard Mitchell , Shelly Winters and the Waco Johnny Dean - Dan Duryea . Steve Miller ( not The Joker ) is interesting as a handsome would be hero who 's interested in Lola but too yellow . Like Stewart in The Man Who Killed Liberty Valance , he 's practically reduced to putting on an apron and serving his enemies coffee . Decaf no doubt . Tony Curtis from the Bronx Cavalry and Rock Hudson behaving like no Indian I 've seen on screen have interesting cameos . Special performances by John McIntire as a too lucky card dealing / gun trader who hangs out at a very low grade Western version of Rick 's American Cafe . Nobody wants to spend the night there . Jay C . Flippens out over a kiss from Lola ( Winters ) and has some nice scenes with Stewart before he gets to Bend of the River and Far Country . Will Geer as Wyatt Earp and the Indian Chief who takes Walter Brennan 's teeth from him in Red River are pleasant sightings . This is the kind of western that only Stewart , not Wayne nor Scott could have pulled off . Worth the shot , I repeat . : - )  
  Winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after WWII . Director Anthony Mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction . Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job , but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the treasured Winchester 73 going to the winner . This is a good script with several stories going on at the same time . Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull . Thank God , with in a few years , we would begin to let Indians play themselves in western films . The film is in black and white and was shot in Tucson Arizona . I would not put Winchester 73 in the category of Stagecoach , High Noon or Shane , but it gets an above average recommendation from me . .  
  Good show . The basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads . There is a set of moral dilemmas that are being faced . Mankind has made a number of technological breakthroughs , but is mankind mature enough to deal with the its new toys ? There is moral decadence in a virtual world . There are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention . I predict ( based on the BSG background ) that there will be an issue with Cylons and slavery . In addition to this , there are all the other problems that we humans bring upon ourselves . This show is not BSG - at least not as far as mankind being on the run from a ruthless problem that was ultimately of their own making . There are not a lot of shoot-em-up or space-based special effects either - at least not in the first few episodes I have seen so far . What it does have are very good stories , characters , and themes . It also has good performances from the actors . They can make a culture which is similar to modern-day society , but alien at the same time be completely believable . Like BSG , this show is about humanity - our strengths , weaknesses , potential , and flaws . It may seem a little odd that a human society on a different set of worlds has neckties , antique cars , and chicken . But those things are really more to create a semi-familiar background than anything else . Anyone who gets stuck on those details is really missing the point . Whether you are from a mafia-style culture or an affluent and high-tech culture , humans and human nature aren't that different 150,000 years ago in a high-tech past than what we see in the world today . Wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something .  
  Cusack does his best David Niven in this one , although I don't know if anyone besides me noticed it . When seen with this in mind , its a deliciously over saturated ' wants to be taken more seriously than Austin powers but still be pretty d * mn funny ' reworking of an under-appreciated comedy classic . Hillary Duff does an over sexualized Britney spears lap dance version of Mata Bond . The writers built a little reverse Oedipus twist into the plot - interesting choice . I never knew how soothing Montel 's voice was until this movie .. I think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs !  
  first , someone mentioned here that because this was released in " limited " quantity it means that it SHOULD be bad .. that is exactly what the " big five " Hollywood studios would like everyone to think so they can " pass " or " ignore " features that are not desirable , without loosing face or imagine by censoring them directly . to the point , this production has been released " limited " because is considered " unpatriotic " by certain individuals . now i absolutely loved this feature ; i find it way better then " Charlie Wilson 's War " even if it is a " fictional " account of something that " never " happens but is always so OBVIOUS . this goes to anyone and everyone interested or affected by present American foreign policies , " home " or " aboard " . the " turakistan " country and " the emerald city " are definitely trying to resemble Iraq and Baghdad just as much as the corporation " Tamerlane " goes for " haliburton " ( with the vice - president Dan Aykroyd playing Dick Cheney , LOL ) . there are quiet a moments actually where the movie is DEAD SERIOUS , not even sarcastic anymore ( main example would be as how John Cusack character deals with his depression , but not only ) . i found that ALL the characters can be related to something / someone or specific stereotypes . now word of advise ; if YOU are not politically active , especially towards the aspects of " globalization " , you will likely not enjoy this feature much since most of its content and inside " jokes " are targeting certain " personalities " that are not " visibile " to the general public on daily bases .. ( main exception would be Hilary Duff that plays the well known materialistic pop star , need i say name ( S ) ? ) . at its CORE the feature is an anti-globalization gig , period . the message is unmistakeably delivered with comic vengeance . Joan has a line at one point that goes like this : " and here we have a book written by you know who , about how i conquered the world and resolved the issues with my dad " . PRICELESS ) ) ) the sister and brother Cusacks play good together as always , same as in " Grosse PointeBlank " i would say a bit more " mature " . Marisa Tomeihere does not show her butt and breasts to " impress " us ( like she did recently in " Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead " ) , but instead she has a very serious role , and manages to pull it off quiet well . many critics don't get it ( can not do so , or do not want to ) . this IS NOT a " regular " movie but more of a comic documentary . this feature stands to deliver a message and NOT to get Oscars , or have " visuals " sort of getting the viewer into buying the latest " HDTV experience " TV sets .. i have noticed even in my local papers that this movie gets bad re-views because is not " artistic " , while PRO Iraq war movies get good thumbs up for being " balanced " apparently and " engaging " . makes one wonders how much all the world mainstream media is concentrated in the hands of a bunch of guys .. i bet this feature will prove a hit overseas as much more then it will in north America . as i mentioned before , it is all a satire about American foreign policy and how it has been hijacked by " special interests " groups .. having the " regular " American soldier wearing the " Tamerlane " corporate logo on its combat dress is pretty insulting BUT EFFECTIVE in showing reality as it IS , or will be soon the way things go so far . some PRICELESS shots : upon " liberation " , the country gets invaded commercial advertisements ; a hilarious scene about how future journalists will likely gather " news " ( " anything is got to be better then this x-box bullocks " ) ) ) ; soldiers dealing with their " frustration " ; overall , i do not recommend this to " conservatives " or " hard core " patriots of some kind or another . this feature is not made to reach to the " minds of souls " of the people ( as mainstream propaganda and commercial interests always try to do so ) . instead it contains a message well defined for realists , and towards some ideological goals apparently " always " short of realizing .  
  Don't mistake " War Inc . " for a sharply chiseled satire or a brainy comedy full of inside jokes for news buffs . It isn't . This is an old-fashioned screwball comedy , with ridiculously coincidental plot twists , stock characters ( given some depth in fun performances by John Cusack , Joan Cusack , Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff ) and a straightforward approach to the political content . You see , the filmmakers ' political points are things nearly all of the country already knows are true . Yeah , we understand that the corporations profiting off the war are corrupt , inept pigs , the political leaders in charge of it are even more inept buffoons , and American imperialism has never looked crasser and more out of touch than it does right now - but none of that is the point . Here , all of that noise is the setting that they lampoon - sometimes in genius ways - as the backdrop for a silly romp , as John Cusack 's character ( the hit-man with a heart ) tries to change his life with the help of the do-gooder journalist who doesn't trust him ( Tomei ) and the young Middle Eastern starlet who wants to call off her marriage ( Duff ) . Cusack 's sister , Joan , plays his assistant with an almost cartoonishly enthusiastic quality . Ben Kingsley seemed to me wasted in his smaller part as a ruthless CIA boss . That 's all , and it works . It 's simple fun , but if somehow you can't see reality and you think the war is going well and everyone involved with it is doing a good job and there 's no corruption and people in the Middle East wish our Western culture would supplant theirs , then you might not find it as funny . For all the rest of us , it was a light comedy with a political edge .  
  Just after I saw the movie , the true magic feeling of the Walt Disney movies came up in me and I realized me that it was a long time ago that I saw the ' real ' magic in a movie . The combination of the right music , speeches and magical effects brings the Disney feeling again into your body . Very special things I saw where the not-knowing effects in the movie , started with the disney logo transforming into the Cinderella castle and ended as an old-story telling fairytale with your grandparents . The magic has returned in me . I rate this movie 8 out of 10 .  
  Many people have commented that this movie was nowhere near as good as the first . Well , maybe it isn't - to you . However , how does your child react to it ? Well , mine loved it more than the first . Disney movies of the past can sometimes be a little harsh for little kids . ( For example - Bambi 's mother getting shot . ) This movie was really great for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and happy endings . If you want to be snobby about what should be Disney 's standards based on the past - skip this movie . If you have a sweet little girl or soft-hearted little boy you really want to please , buy this movie and treat your small children . This film is great as a bedtime movie for happy dreams instead of nightmares . I 'm happy with a movie that pleases my kid & doesn't need to impress the parents all the time .  
  A linear travel within a non-linear structure . It 's a fact that time , in 12 monkeys , flows in this come-and-go between present , future and past . However , the movie 's linearity can't be avoided : it 's the very work of the projector , the unfolding of the narrative . What we can see underlying the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions . The world of this Terry Gilliam film is a world with little space for free-will . Right from the beginning we are informed about a schizophrenic 's prophecy , according to which a plague would rule the Earth in 1997 , forcing the few survivors to live underground - the only place not affected by the virus . Cole 's ( Willis ) mission is clear : return to the mid 90 's to investigate whatever and whoever is related to the release of the virus . There 's no way to change the past : all that can be done is gather information that can help the scientists of the present ( that , for us viewers , is the future ) find the cure . Not to change what happened ( the past is inevitable ) , but make the present better . In his " returns " in time , Cole gradually comes near a striking dilemma : his life in the past is better than his life in the present . The latter is dark and dehumanizing , controlled by totalitarian scientists that elect " volunteers " ( this word is incisively ironic ) to embark on the journeys to the past . The scientists have not yet reached the highest level of achievements in time travel , and Cole ends up on wrong dates - this will , later in the plot , work as a proof of his sanity for the psychiatrist Kathryn ( Stowe ) . We can see , through the evolution of the story , that linearity and non-linearity interlace in a circular temporality . There is more than one moment in which the scene that is the first and ends up being almost the last - and certainly the climactic - appears . It modifies itself , according to the evocation of Cole 's memories , that come up in his dreams . In an airport , a man is shot dead while running , armed , toward someone else . A blonde woman runs after the murdered one . This is the scene that connects the past ( in which Cole is a kid that visits the airport with his parents ) , the present ( the time of the narrative ) and the future ( adult Cole ) Throughout the narrative , Cole has the feeling of having already lived the reality he is experiencing now . His prophetic dreams are the proof that it is impossible to escape or avoid what happened . The agents that shoot him stop him from killing the mad scientist , doctor Peters ( Morse ) , that is the responsible for the dissemination of the disease . What was can't be changed . And , in Cole 's case , what was is what will be . Eternally . A film not quite well understood for many . To me , nothing less than a masterpiece . Other good movies with similar theme : The Back to the future trilogy ( that has another angle regarding the " mad scientist " character , and although it shares the atmosphere of decay - particularly in the second film - , it is way more optimistic than Gilliam 's work , that is an odd Hollywood picture ) . In another register , there is " Wild strawberries " , one of Bergman 's masterpieces , that involves a striking and enlightening travel to the past through dreams and reminiscences . I 've never watched " La Jetée " , but only because I can't find it .  
  The big problem is where to begin as this movie needs your attention the forthcoming two hours and you better not miss some minutes for getting a coke as there is a danger you can't follow . But good there is also a pause-button . Bruce Willis must travel into a timemachine to find out some antivirus for a virus that made animals rule over the world in 1996 . Thanks to some mistakes he first ends up in 1990 , then in the First World War and how messed up it all might look like , Terry Gilliam comes up with what must be one of the most intelligent scripts ever . This ex-Monty Phyton man knows exactly how genius SF-stories has to be told like and his choice of cast couldn't have been any better , there is the lunatic Brad Pitt ( his performance in the asylum is memorable ) and a superb Bruce Willis who proves he is more than some Schwarzenegger-wanna be . It 's a movie you can watch over and over again as the script is so weird and complicated ( and yet you can follow ) that every view gives you other surprises . One of my big favourites .  
  An intriguingly bold film weaves the seemingly effortless camerawork with some superb casting and an explosive soundtrack to plot the damaging effects of the crime and corruption of the Santiago underworld on 2 naive young brothers from the southern city of Temuco . Film debutant Daniella Rios is the seductive erotic dancer Gracia , working in the nightclub owned by the face of the new mini-wave in Chilean film production , Alejandro Trejo . The elder brother , played maturely by Nestor Cantillana , is easily convinced to become Trejo 's lead henchman , after a night at the stripclub to celebrate younger brother Victor 's ( Juan Pablo Miranda ) seventeenth birthday . From the establishing shot of this opening scene , the film explodes into neo-noir exploration of everything the outside world doesn't usually expect to see in this country so stereotypically conservative and catholic . Gracia 's charms of seduction attract the three men like bees to honey , although the circular narrative of the three-way fantasy romance revolves around the linear portrayal of major international drug deals between Trejo 's men and the ' Gringo ' , Eduardo Barril . Power relations become a vital theme , as society 's outsiders merge in a mini-family . The prostitute holds an exotic spell over all the chilean men in the film , emerging from her ambiguous position in the periphery of society , and is seen as holding the key to all three men 's futures . The relationships between Trejo and Cantillana become important , as the boys ' parents are conspicious by their absence ( one assumes they still live in Temuco ) . Therefore it is Trejo , el padrino , who ' adopts ' Cantillana , and effectively ' makes him ' as a man in the city . Miranda rapidly becomes the desperate outsider , as his dependency on his ' father figure ' , Cantillana , becomes increasingly strained by jealousy over the beautiful Gracia . However , Miranda remains trapped by the constraint of still being in school - he is dependent on Cantillana , who is dependent on Trejo , for the money to survive . Trejo , in turn , is under the thumb of the ' Gringo ' , and his wealth has been accumulated through drug deals and well as his strip clubs . The figure of Gracia acts as a time bomb viewed as a beautiful firework , she wraps a web of beauty inside the patriarchy but the strain can only lead to one climax . As the tensions of these power relations come to head , Gracia remains ambiguously elusive . The viewer is never sure which male figure she will commit to . The film concludes tragically and explosively in a shoot out which realigns power relations and erases half the major male protanganists . The final shot of Miranda 's beaten face speeding down the PanAmericano highway is despairingly powerful . The boy has been sucked in by the lure of the city 's underworld , yet has lost his only visible family , and his woman , who is his only friend in the film . He has nothing . The overriding metaphors are bold and brave . This is a gangster film in Chile . The notions of family , no sex before marriage etc , are abolished , and instead the harsh realities of the other side of Santiago 's coin are displayed in all their savage glory . Trejo beats Rios brutally , Rios and Miranda make love in a cinema reel room - a whore having sex with a minor she barely knows . The ' gringos ' are seen to have a financial hold over this small Latin American nation , but not through the copper mines , through the illegal path of drugs . Waissbluth 's triumph is in his presentation of this dark underworld , which raises so many social questions , more perhaps than the record-breakingly successful Sexo Con Amor , within a slick , smooth firecracker of a film , which place this film firmly alongside Sexo Con Amor , Taxi Para Tres , and El chacotero Sentimental , as cinematic evidence that Chile is well and truly artistically alive and kicking in the post-transition period 15 years after the censorship of the Military Regime .  
  Definitely at the top five of best John Garfield movies has to be Pride of the Marines . It 's the true story of Marine private Al Schmid who at the cost of his own sight , while wounded held off a horde of storming Japanese on Guadalcanal . The story nicely segments in three parts , Al Schmid 's home life where he 's a simple working stiff who 's just getting serious with a woman and who likes nothing better than his bowling night . Pearl Harbor is bombed and he 's off to war as millions of others were . The second part is at Guadalcanal and we see part of the action where he 's in an isolated machine gun nest , holding off Japanese troops . His action prevented Marine positions from being overrun , but a grenade does in his eyesight . And of course the third part is his painful adjustment to civilian life and to reassure himself that people aren't just caring for him out of pity , most of all that girl he was seeing Eleanor Parker . This film was broadcast on TCM on John Garfield 's 95th birthday and there was a documentary on Garfield hosted by his daughter . One of the people interviewed said that Garfield was the actor most believable in working class roles in having and holding a union card . In that respect he was lucky in that he did land with Warner Brothers in Hollywood . Though he kept getting typecast in gangster roles in the tradition of that studio , Garfield was terrific in these parts because of his background , because he came from the kind of life Al Schmid had , with the exception of Garfield 's Jewish background . In that respect he was perfect to play the part of a working class hero like Al Schmid who accepted the responsibility of defending his country . No super heroics here , just a guy who 'd rather have been back in Philadelphia , but doing a job that had to be done . It 's a great part for Garfield . It 's a film one shouldn't miss . I do wonder though whatever happened to the real Al Schmid .  
  Well , when before I saw this film I really wasn't sure whether it would be my cup of tea .. how wrong I was ! I thought that this was one of the best films I 've watched for a very long time , a real family classic . The story of a young evacuee and his new ' foster ' dad , this film ticks all the boxes . I 've not read the book ( maybe that 's a good thing & meant I enjoyed the film more ) but with regards to the story , I really can't think of any bad points , hence scoring it 10 out of 10 ( and I hardly ever think anything warrants top marks ! ) . By the time William proclaimed ' I CAN RIDE MY BIKE , DAD ! ' I was sobbing my heart out ( anyone who 's seen it will understand , I 'm sure ) . Really heartwarming , and definitely recommended .  
  Eyeliner was worn nearly 6000 years ago in Egypt . Really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the 12th century . I also didn't realize the series flopped . There is a second season airing now isn't there ? It is amazing to me when commentaries are made by those who are either ill-informed or don't watch a show at all . It is a waste of space on the boards and of other 's time . The first show of the series was maybe a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place , but that is to be expected from any show . The remainder of the first season is excellent . I can hardly wait for the second season to begin in the United States .  
  I couldn't believe the comments made about the movie . As I read the awful opinions about the movie I actually wondered if you had actually viewed the same movie that I did . What I viewed was incredible ! I think the actresses and director did a fantastic job in the movie . I hadn't had the pleasure to see either actress previously and I couldn't have been more set back by the incredible job that they did I 'd have to say its the most believable movie that I 've seen in a long time . What I don't see is why everyone has such a problem with Deanna 's choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene , from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice . That I don't understand , its a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else so how it can be the actresses error I fail to see . I think it was a real believable movie that I would see again and recommend . Opinions are what the are and its too bad that so many are so close minded . I hope to see any of the actors soon I think that all played great roles . Busy Philipps will be the highest paid actress someday and I hope she can laugh in the face of everyone that criticized her ! You Go Girl !  
  If you are looking for a sonic boom special effects monster , click the BACK button on your browser . Deathtrap was written by Ira Levin ( Sliver , The Stepford Wives , Rosemary 's Baby ) . It 's a stage play , adapted for the screen . 95 % of the movie takes place in the gorgeous home of playwright Sidney Bruhl ( Michael Caine ) . He 's the author of a fabulously successful Broadway play , but his last 4 efforts have flopped - horribly . An aspiring playwright , Clifford Anderson ( Christopher Reeve ) , who attended a play-writing workshop given by Sydney , has sent him a copy of the play he has written . Sydney tells his wife , Myra ( Dyan Cannon ) the play is fabulous - a sure-fire hit . But is it good enough to die for ? Time will tell . Clever dialog and numerous twists and turns in the plot keep this movie entertaining from beginning to end . The whole cast seems to have a good time . It 's reminiscent of another fun Michael Caine mystery : Sleuth . Worth watching .  
  I was lucky enough to get a DVD copy of this movie recently and have now seen it for the 2nd time . The 1st time was on late night TV in Australia more than 20 years ago but I could never forget this strange and bleak film .. Not many people like this film at all because it is so unconventional - the fact that there is hardly any spoken dialogue in this move - we just hear the thoughts of characters - is only one unconventional aspect of it . Searching for a copy of this film I found out that the producer was dead , the main actor was dead , it was not kept in any British TV or film archives , that it was never released on video or DVD , that television networks around the world trashed it after their copyright ran out in the 80 's . When it was first shown on TV in Australia there were no recordable devices for consumers . On the second viewing recently , I could see why it was unforgettable . At times it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic very like a Harold Pinter stage play . Again , if anyone wants a DVD copy of this please email me and I 'm sure we can work something out Regards Adam ( whiteflokati @ hotmail . com )  
  Before I begin , let me tell you how GREAT this stand-up special sounds when you play Sonic Adventure I DX : Director 's Cut at the same time ( Red Mountain level in particular ) . So while watching this stand-up special , I suggest - no , DEMAND you do it . Carlos Mencia takes his stand-up to the extreme in San Francisco , California . There , he makes fun of everybody with absolutely NO apologies . I am pretty much thanking God here that Carlos didn't do his thing in which he uses the same joke over and over and over and over and over again . He does a tremendous job making fun of everyone and at the same time be truthful about it ; I know a couple of times I said , after Carlos said a joke , " Damn , this guy makes a good point ! " And then the Game Over screen came over my TV because I forgot I was playing Sonic Adventure I DX : Director 's Cut . My bad : ) So yeah , there 's nothing to complain about this stand-up special . If you have TiVo or something like that , please do yourself a favor and record this historic hour .  
  Fire And Ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world . The film is about a village that is destroyed by a giant glacier which is the home of the evil ice lord named Nekron . The only survivor of the village is a young man named Larn who sets out to avenge those who were killed by the glacier . The ice glacier moves through the land of fire and the princess of the land named Teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures . Larn sets out to find her and also sets out to find and kill Nekron . Fire And Ice is directed by Ralph Bakshi who is one of my favourite adult animators . He has brought us such animated masterpieces as the film version of Fritz The Cat and some films he has written himself , like the great film Heavy Traffic . I didn't like Fire And Ice nearly as much as I have Ralph Bakshi 's other work , but I still found the film to be enjoyable . It had some very nice animation in parts and the story was entertaining enough . The only basic complaints I have is that I wish that there was more of a story to the film because the story it uses is very thin and there is not a lot to it . I also wish the film was a bit longer because it is under 80 minutes in running time . Still it 's an entertaining action adventure films that unlike Fritz The Cat or Heavy Traffic is appropriate for kids 8 and older . I only wish that there was a more developed story and it went on a bit longer than it did .  
  This is one of my favorite Govinda movies of all time and best film of 1994 . David Dhawan does a great job in directing this movie , he makes it funny and adds family drama . Govinda is Excellent as Raja Babu and gives a great performance . Karishma Kapoor is an actress i hate , this film she is a little less annoying but still annoys in some scenes . Kader Khan is a maestro in acting and yet gives a superb performance . Aroona Irani is terrific as the mother and gives a outstanding performance . Shakti Kapoor is brilliant as Nandu the sidekick . This film has Comedy , action , family drama and romance a full on entertainer .  
  If you haven't seen Eva Longoria from the TV show " Desperate House Wives " then you are missing out . Eva is going to be one of the biggest Latina stars and you 'll be seeing her in the theaters soon . This was Eva 's first film and she does a fantastic job acting . She was 24 when she shot it , and looked hot then . As for this low budget film , it 's pretty good for the first time director , who has another soon to be released movie " Juarez , Mexico " currently playing at many film festivals across the United States . In fact , it appears that it may have a limited theatrical release from some news . What would be nice to see is a " Snitch'2 " with a higher budget .  
  This is a film that the mainstream market will probably never be able to access as it doesn't exactly give the viewer easy watching . The story about troubled Spike and his friend Heaton is not exactly a Friday night film yet it has its own unique edge and I found that it was entertaining . There are moments of brilliance given that the film was shot on such a low budget , such as when Spike inhales the aerosol . However I did not really understand the relationship between Spike and Heaton and to be honest it made me spend most of the film trying to work it out . And also I did not like the fact that most of the film is spent with the two friends talking and not really much " action " . It is a small film that is complex to watch and that is what makes it appealing .  
  My short comment for this flick is go pick it up . Chances are you are going to be positively surprised by a diversity of elements superbly explored in this criminal thriller . There is no way the character of Miklos , claiming and pushing for room in every way possible , wont push your nerves to the edge .. 2 thumbs up !  
  My choice for greatest movie ever used to be Laughton 's " Night of the Hunter " which remains superb in my canon . But , it may have been supplanted by " Shower " which is the most artistically Daoist movie I have seen . The way that caring for others is represented by the flowing of water , and the way that water can be made inspiration , and comfort , and cleansing , and etc . is the essence of the Dao . It is possible to argue that the the NOFTH and Shower themes are similar , and that Lillian Gish in the former represents the purest form of Christianity as the operators of the bathhouse represent the purest form of Daoism . I would not in any way argue against such an interpretation . Both movies are visual joys in their integration of idea and image . Yet , Shower presents such an unstylized view of the sacredness of everyday life that I give it the nod . I revere both .  
  Very different topic treated in this film . A straightforward and simple description of local Chinese customs , by looking at the daily operation of a public bath , run by the old owner and his retarded son , when older son returns home , wrongly believing his father has died . How every man in town makes his daily visit to chat , play games , discuss personal matters and get honest advice , besides the usual spa-like therapies . When old man dies , strong and loyal family ties make older son take charge , so public bath operation is not disrupted . And finally , the arrival of modernization to end this way of spending relaxed hours and getting along . The public bath has to be demolished , making place for a commercial complex to be constructed .  
  How powerful and captivating simple quality filmmaking can be . This film tells it 's tale with everyday scenes that manage to revel the poignancy hidden within . It 's true as others have stated , how this film really makes it glaringly obvious how lost Hollywood is in it 's special effects , overblown emotionalism and over the top climatic endings and have forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told with simple realism . So much of what these characters are going through is implied by the scene rather than spelled out in wordy dialogue . One aspect that I really enjoyed about the film was the contrast of the two brothers , one so very openly expressive in his childlike way and the other completely stoic but both able to evoke deep emotion . The older brother needed to say little , as he usually did , it was all there in that deadpan face of his ! Beautiful cinematography , wonderful acting , great direction ! Not to be missed !  
  This beautiful story of an elder son coming home , and learning to love and be a part of all those things that he left home to get away from , is poignant and moving . It shows a society that is perhaps strange to us in the Western world , with a sense of family that we have lost . The story is beautiful , sad , and at times funny and comic . It has a feeling of realism that we don't seem to see any longer in our western movies . The acting is unusual , in that as the movie progresses , it almost gives the impression that it is not acting , but a documentary of ordinary people . This is brilliant directing and movie making . Would love to see more movies by this director .  
  I haven't laughed that much in a long time - although the movie has some sad moments too , especially when it changes from hyper-funny to honest and serious . The characters are very realistic most of the times , sappy sometimes , but quite believable . I am not a fan of the Jerry Springer show - I feel sorry for the participating people . This film instead is a satire , and it is doing great . Too bad that all expletives were * beeped * out while this movie aired on public tv , that takes a lot of fun out of it . I will go rent this movie to fully enjoy it .  
  Comparable to Fight Club , The Matrix , A.I. , Sixth Sense , among others . This film approaches the psyche in a way never done before . The first 30 minutes builds a interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz . The rest of the movie is , well , confusing , you 'll pick more every time you watch it ( i 've gone to the movies to see it 3 times now )  
  When I started to watch this movie on VH-1 I cringed . The MTV movies were all bad so I wasnt expecting much . But this movie was really good . I liked it a lot . And it even had a twist at the end . See this movie because it shows that Made For TV movies that are good exist .  
  Nothing new is this tired serio-comedy that wastes the talents of Danny Glover and Whoopi Goldberg . Considering that this was produced by the stars and Spike Lee , it 's pretty tame and tired stuff . And how come the Whoop never changes her hair or glasses over the many years this film covers ? Blah !  
  Story about four teenage girls growing up in California . Jeanie ( Jodie Foster ) is the most level-headed of the bunch-but wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother ( Sally Kellerman ) . Annie ( Cherie Currie ) is addicted to drugs , alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father . Madge ( Marilyn Kagan ) has overprotective parents . Deirde ( Kandice Stroh ) thinks she 's more mature than the rest of them . This is nothing new from what we 've seen plenty of times before-but this one has one big difference-it 's accurate . I graduated from high school in 1980 ( when I first saw the film ) and I was surprised at how realistic it was . They got the dialogue , clothes and attitudes down completely right . Even the main song of the movie ( " On the Radio " by Donna Summer ) was a big hit before this came out . This film hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because I could understand and relate to the characters . I knew girls in high school who were just like this ! The film is ( of course ) dated but it captures a time we will never see again . The acting is good on all counts with Foster giving the best performance . The relationship between her and Kellerman ( who was excellent ) was realistic and well-done . Even Scott Baio ( who has a small role as a friend of the girls ) more or less realistically played a teen boy . A very good movie-essential viewing if you came of age in 1980 . The film has a deserved R rating ( plenty of drug use and swearing ) but should be seen by all teens . I give it a 8 .  
  CAT SOUP has two " Hello Kitty " - type kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife , where anything can happen , and does . This mind-tripping Asian short uses no dialog , substituting word balloons instead . There is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself . And make sure no one under 10 is in the room . Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes . Honest . Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in , and also ride . But like practically everything else in this film , that silly , picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end .  
  Gender Bender sexes things up a bit for the x-files . This episode has an interesting premise , a good story , but an ending that is wanting . Gender Bender is also the x-files debut for actor Nicholas Lea , better known as Alex Krycek . In this episode he plays Michael , a man attacked by one of " The Kindred " . You need to see this episode just to see Nic Lea 's less than spectacular beginning . An interesting thing about the Kindred 's " power of seduction " . When Marty does it to his victims , they become turned onto him / her . However , when Andrew seduces Scully , she only because disoriented and groggy , and does not become attracted to Andrew . Maybe it 's because Marty has more experience at it than Andrew . This episode reminds me of why it would sometimes be miserable to film up in British Columbia . Throughout the episode it is so wet , soggy , and muddy , it could not have been that much fun . Despite the disappointing ending , Gender Bender is still a decent episode to view .  
  This episode from the first season slightly edges towards controversy with the whole gender bending angle . I imagine there would have been a significant amount of editing before this was finished to appease censors . The story itself is original and well written and the directing is complemented by the fine acting . ( Nicholas Lea makes his X-Files debut though not as Agent Krycek but as a victim called Michael ) I especially enjoyed the built up to and the ending itself . Its different but enjoyable . Ignore any bad reviews you may hear . Watch it for yourself and make judgement then  
  As a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the DVDs themselves , we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from Broken in disc form . And yet what 's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a James Cameron DVD and a decidedly fine presentation . With regards to the latter , the only major flaw is that Broken comes with a non-anamorphic transfer . Otherwise we get the film in its original 1.85:1 ratio , demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected . Indeed , given Ferrari 's hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact . The same is also true of the soundtrack . Here we are offered both DD2.0 and DD5.1 mixes and whilst I 'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the " original " , the fact that Ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior . Indeed , though the DD5.1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilizes the score , both are equally fine and free of technical flaws . As for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them . Take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you 'll notice numerous commentaries , loads of featurettes and various galleries . Indeed , given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary , there really is little to discuss . The ' Anatomy of a Stunt ' featurette , for example , is exactly what it claims to be , and the same goes for the rest of pieces . As such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of Broken 's pre-production , production and post-production . And whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall ' making of ' , in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view . Of the various pieces , then , it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion . Then again , there 's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks . The one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesn't take the film too seriously . Ferrari 's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing . And the technical ones are , well , extremely technical . Of course , we also get some crossover with what 's been covered elsewhere on the discs , but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome . Indeed , all in all , a fine extras package .  
  I recently purchassed the very underrated Dreamcast and went off into town to find some games to use them on . I bought Soul Calibur ( A classic ) and then i stepped across the domain of Resident Evil Code Veronica . I have Resident Evil 1 & 2 , and have played Res Evil 3 numerous occasions , and i have been impressed with all of them , especially no . 1 which has to go down in history has a classic . But none of them 3 come anywhere near to the dreamcast attempt of Brilliant Gory Gameplay . If its just for the sake of buying a dreamcast for this game it is worth every moment of your time and effort , ive never been so enthralled over a computer game in the way this has enthralled me . Anyway , the story carrys on from the 2nd story in which Claire Redfield searches for her Brother ( Chris - from the 1st story ) , who is presumed missing under the conspiracy of the dreaded umbrella corporation . Little is known about this corporation except the fact that you though you destroyed them 3 times in the previous storys . So aiding Claire , with the assistant of super brat Steve , u must unlock the truth of the real location of your brother . The 2nd CD enables you to control Chris , thats if you manage to get that far without running out of the room in fear . The control are very slick and the movement of the characters are magnificently realistic , when the character notices danger , he / she faces the direction it is coming from . PURE GENIUS ! Overall i gave this game 10/10 because it is simply the game of the year , game of the decade and the best game in the world full stop ! . Please purchase this game as soon as possible .  
  I don't know the stars , or modern Chinese teenage music - but I do know a thoroughly entertaining movie when I see one . Kung Fu Dunk is pure Hollywood in its values - it 's played for laughs , for love , and is a great blend of Kung Fu and basketball . Everybody looks like they had a lot of fun making this - the production values are excellent - and modern China looks glossier than Los Angeles here . The plot of the abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung fu school only to be kicked out and then discover superstardom as a basketball play ( and love and more etc ; ) is great - this is fresh , fun , and immensely entertaining . With great action and good dialogue this is one simply to enjoy - for all ages - and for our money was one of the best family movies we 're seen in a long time . Please ignore the negative reviews and give Dunk a chance - we were really glad we did - a GOOD sports comedy movie .  
  The first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series ! Mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama ! I love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories concerning the characters ! Explaining just enough to stay excited ! Of course this show has some flaws ! In the first two series there are some characters who for some reason don't show up in the third season ! Many of the characters have a decent sent off but some of them just aren't there ! Like Rose and her husband ! Where the hell are they ? What happened to them ? Maybe they will return in later episodes ! But it is a little inconsistent ! That being said " Lost " manages to be thrilling every episode ( especially the first two seasons ) ! That is a very hard thing to do ! I do notice that in the third season the focus is more on character development than the mystery aspects of the show ! This is not a bad thing ! It even saves some episodes from getting boring ! One of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters ! You will grow to love these characters ! Good or bad ! But eventually I will want to see some mysteries to be solved and get closure ! The danger of " Lost " getting canceled due to declining ratings is near ! And that would be devastating !  
  The first series of Lost kicked off with a bang .. literally and slowly decreased in pace . This may have put some viewers off and people who started to watch halfway through would either be bored or just plain confused . I would advise people new to the world of Lost to simply watch from the beginning and don't get pt off by the slower episodes . The acting throughout is excellent but why have 5 series ' planned .. WHY ? All this means is that there will be no answers for at least 4 years , oh well , i 'll keep watching if it keeps the tension up and dialogue flowing .  
  This film surprised me a little . I watch a lot of horror / sci-fi films and this is a straight-to-video release that caught me off guard a little . I believe this is Full Moon 's best movie thus far and one of Jeffrey Combs best performances . Good movie .  
  Wow , this film had a huge impact on me , it moved me , . It is an amazing story about a girl in Cambodia who is sold into the sex trade . I can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named Holly . The setting of the film is realistic , The film was an eye opener , I can not imagine anyone walking away from it with out wanting to help make a change with this horrifying problem that exsists . The content of the film was very very moving . It was one of the best films that I have seen this year . The girl who plays Holly does a fantastic job with her character . Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance . The film moved me to tears , It tells an important message that needs to be heard worldwide . Everyone should go see this film . I think this film will make a difference , I loved it !  
  " Holly " is an issue-driven film , but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental . At its heart is it is a character-driven film , which wouldn't be nearly so successful without the fleshed-out portrayals of Patrick ( Ron Livingston ) , the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience , and Holly ( Thuy Nguyen ) , the strong-willed but ultimately over-matched young Vietnamese girl . From the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing , everything is forthright and well-done . The contemporary classical score may put some off at first , but it is top-notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout . This film , which raises many issues but provides few clear-cut answers , ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for Holly and the many who share her plight . Kudos to those who managed to get it made .  
  I know I should like this film , and I do for the most part , but as other 's have mentioned , it is a bit long in the tooth . I to also found the raging hormones of the all male crew to be a bit annoying . It 's a wonder they didn't start panting and howling at the moons as well . I also have to say that overall , the movie leaves me cold . It 's a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film . On the plus side the effects are great ( besides the cartoon monster ) , as are the effects , props , costumes and of course Robbie . If the robot was not in this film , I don't think it would have been as popular as it was / is . The second half of the movie picks up steam once we start to investigate the forgotten gadgets of the " Krell . " As many times as I 've seen this movie , the Krell still leaves me scratching my head as to exactly who or what they were . Based on what was being produced at that time , besides " This Island Earth , " Forbidden Planet is miles above the average Sci-Fi movies of the time . Being filmed in color also adds to its enjoyment . Certainly a classic in its own right , flaws and all , and deservedly so .  
  It is rare that one comes across a movie as flawless as this . It 's truly one of the best acted , most tightly structured films I 've ever seen . Every line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways , relating to each of the three main characters differently . The film weaves an intrinsic web of motivations and double crosses that snare you and refuse to let go . Add to this that the slow-burning romance between Kevin and Faye is as moving as anything that 's ever been committed to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film . It exposes the romance of movies such as " Titanic " as the trite cliches they are . If you 're looking for a movie to watch while you fold laundry , this isn't it . You have to commit yourself to this film . You can't have a conversation while running in and out of the room . This movie demands your attention . Treat it with the respect you deserve and you 'll get a lot out of it . Unless you think " Titanic " is the greatest film ever .  
  * SPOILERS * * SPOILERS * Released in 1956 , and considered quite racy at the time , Douglas Sirk 's over the top candy colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing . The plot concerns the goings on in an oil rich dysfunctional Texas family that includes big brother Kyle , who is insecure , weak , wounded & very alcoholic , played by Robert Stack in a very touching & vulneable performance and his sluty sister Marylee played in an extreme manner by Dorothy Malone . Ms . Malone 's performance is telegraphed to us via her eyes , which she uses to show us her emotions , which mostly consist of lust ( for Rock Hudson ) and jealousy ( for Lauren Bacall ) . Malone is the only actress I 've ever seen in movies who enters a room eyes first . Now don't get me wrong , her performance to say the least is an absolute hoot , and is one of the supreme camp acting jobs of the 1950 's . But it is also terrible , because as likeable and attractive as Malone is , she 's not a very good actress , and she 's not capable of subtly or shading . Her performace is of one note . She does get to do a wicked Mambo , and in a great montage , as unloving daddy played by the always good Robert Keith falls to his death climbing a staircase , Sirk mixes it up with an almost mad Malone doing a orgasmic dance as she undresses . Stack , ( who should have won an Oscar ) & Malone , ( who won the award , but shouldn't have ) are the real stars of the film , the ones who set all the hysteria , both sexual & otherwise in motion , while the " real stars " of the film , Hudson & Bacall fade to grey & brown , which are the colors that they are mainly costumed in . Hudson who was a better actor then given credit for plays the childhood & best friend of Stack 's , and the stalked love interest of Malone 's who moans & groans over Rock through most of the film . But Hudson wants no part of her , and instead is in love with Bacall who is married to Stack . No one is very happy & no one is happy for very long . The Stack-Bacall marriage falls apart big time after a year , and Stack pretty much drinks himself into oblivion because he thinks he is sterile , and can't give Bacall a baby to prove that he 's a man . Sirk who was a very intelligent man , and had a long & fascinating career both in films and theatre in Germany , ended his Hollywood career at Universal in the mid 1950 's with a series of intense vividly colored " women 's movies " or melodramas . Although they were mainly adapted from medicore or trashy source material , in Sirk 's hands they became masterpieces of the genre . Sirk had a wonderful sense of color & design which he brought to play in these films filling his wide screen spaces with characters who played out their emotional lives among weird color combinations & lighting , make believe shadows , and lots of mirroed reflections . In " Written " the characters are always peeking out of windows , listening at doors or sneaking around . So in the end , after much violence , an accidental murder , a miscarriage & more Sirk ends the movie with a final & startling scene of a " reborn " and reformed Malone in a man-tailored suit , sitting at a desk foundling a miniature oilwell .  
  Stack should have received the Academy Award for this performance , period . Its a crime that he did not . Amazing how he humanizes a rich worthless character . Dorothy Malone did earn a well-deserved Academy Award for her performance . In fact , all of the acting in this film is excellent . The plot begins with a taxi ride , then an airplane ride , then keeps moving on an emotional ride that will hold your interest throughout . You will be entertained ! However , this is only a blatant soap opera . One-dimensional , 100-percent soaper . You might call it the ultimate soaper , because the acting so thoroughly triumphs over the material . Excellently acted , well directed , but strictly within its soap genre . I wouldn't even call it a melodrama ( such as " Mildred Pierce " or " Imitation of Life " ) . While not denying the great entertainment value of this film , you can only imagine what this talented cast and director might have achieved with more substantial subject matter .  
  The absolute summum of the oeuvre of that crafty Dane Douglas Sirk ( born Detlef Sierck ) , Written on the Wind compels our prurient attention in every gaudy frame . From its justly famous opening sequence , with the leaves blowing into the baronial foyer of a Texas mansion and the wind riffling the pages of the calendar into a flashback , the movie compresses into its 99 minutes all the familial intrigue that was to fuel such later , little-screen knockoffs as Dallas , Dynasty and Falcon Crest over their years-long runs . The combination of wealth and dysfunction is a theme Americans , in our dollar-based society , find irresistible . Brother and sister Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are the spoiled , troubled heirs to the Hadly oil fortune ; boyhood chum Rock Hudson and new bride Lauren Bacall are the sane outsiders who try to keep the lid on the roiling cauldron . ( It 's been rumored that the story was based on Libby Holmann 's marriage into Reynolds tobacco money . ) As always , the misfits get all the scenery to chew - and the best lines to spit out ( Malone , in her Oscar-nabbing performance as the boozing nymphomaniac with a jones for Hudson , gets to detonate a whole fireworks display of them ) . Hudson , while good , can't compete with all this over-the-top emoting ; Bacall starts out strong but grows recessive , a mere plot convenience . No matter ; with a succession of set-pieces shot in extravagant hues , Sirk gives an object lesson in how to turn out overwrought melodrama set in the lush consumer paradise of late-50s America . Nobody ever did it better .  
  What is " Cry Freedom " like ? It is simply great and unique experience about making of South Africa and how black people in that country were repressed by white people . Main character of the story is Donald Woods ( Kevin Kline ) , chief editor of the newspaper Daily Dispatch in South Africa . Woods writes several articles , where he speaks critically about views of Steve Biko ( Denzel Washington ) . Soon Woods meets Biko and he changes his views about him and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in South Africa ( right from the top , even from the chief of police ) . When Biko dies in police custody , Woods decides that he have to write book about him and that no matter what he has to publish it . But Woods must escape from his country to get that book published and he must also put his family on second place , so world can find out the truth . Attenborough managed to make a good movie about people , with main message that black and white are the same , cause we are all people . Story leads us to South Africa and this ( movie ) is great way for the whole world to learn what happened in that land and I 'm disappointed that only 3200 people rated this movie . This is movie from which we all can learn something . Although it is a bit long , this story couldn't be presented in any shorter way because director wanted to show us how hard was for Woods to get that book published after death of Biko . Also relationship between Woods and Biko was shown great , just like families of those two people and all the problems they are going through . But sometimes sacrifices must be made ( Biko 's death ) so the truth could be reveled ( Woods book ) .  
  After repeated listenings to the CD soundtrack , I knew I wanted this film , got it for Christmas and I was amazed . Marc Bolan had such charisma , i can't describe it . I 'd heard about him in that way , but didn't understand what people were talking about until I was in the company of this footage . He was incredible . Clips from the Wembley concert are interspersed with surrealistic sketches such as nuns gorging themselves at a garden party as Marc Bolan performs some acoustic versions of Get It On , etc . ( I 'm still learning the song titles ) . George Claydon , the diminutive photographer from Magical Mystery Tour , plays a chauffeur who jumps out of a car and eats one of the side mirrors . Nothing I can say to describe it would spoil it , even though I put the spoilers disclaimer on this review , so you would just need to see this for yourselves . It evades description . Yes , I love the Beatles and was curious about Ringo directing a rock documentary - that was 35 years ago - now , I finally find out it 's been on DVD for 2 years , but it 's finally in my home . It 's an amazing viewing experience - even enthralling . Now the DVD comes with hidden extras and the following is a copy and paste from another user : There 's two hidden extras on the Born To boogie double DVD release . 1 . From the menu on disc one , select the bonus material and goto the extra scenes 2 .

  After reading the other tepid reviews and comments , I felt I had to come to bat for this movie . Roeg 's films tend to have little to do with one another , and expecting this one to be like one of his you liked is probably off the mark . What this film is is a thoughtful and unabashed look at religious faith . The only other film like it-in terms of its religious message-would have to be Tolkin 's ` The Rapture . ' I am astonished that anyone could say the story is muddled or supernatural . It is a simple movie about Catholic faith , miracles , and redemption-though you would never guess it till the end . It is also the only movie I can think of whose resolution turns , literally , on a pun . As a ( happily ) fallen Catholic myself , I know what the movie is about , and I find a sort of fondness in its ultimate innocence about the relation between God and man . But if you are not familiar with the kind of theology on which the film is based , then it will go right over you head . As a film-as opposed to a story - ` Cold Heaven ' it is not ground-breaking . While ` The Rapture ' is heavy with pictorial significance and cinematic imagery , ` Cold Heaven ' downplays its own cinematic qualities . There are no striking shots , no edgy effects , no attempts to fit the content to the form . It is workmanlike shooting , but subdued . Nor does it have dialogue or acting to put it in a class of high drama . It is a simple story that unfolds simply . It may seem odd ; but at the end the mystery is revealed . It looks ambiguous ; but with a single line the ambiguity vanishes in a puff of Catholic dogma . In this regard , ` Cold Heaven ' has at its heart exactly the same sort of thing that drives a movie like ` The Sting , ' or ` The Sixth Sense , ' or ` Final Descent , ' or Polanski 's ` A Pure Formality . ' All of these are films with a trick up their sleeves . They may frustrate you along the way , but they have a point-an obvious one , indeed-but the fun is , at least in part , in having been taken in . Still , even if it seems like little more than a shaggy dog story with a punch line , it is worth watching for way it directs-and misdirects-you . Try it-especially if you are , or have ever been , a Catholic .  
  Silly movie is really , really funny . Yes , it 's got its dead moments , it can be a bit too obvious , it declines a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess , but it 's laugh out loud funny all the way . And it 's worth seeing just for Ed McMahon as a right wing kook . This movie is in the same class as Elvira , Mistress of the Dark , another incredibly funny , underappreciated film .  
  As a kid I thought this movie was great . It had animals , it had beautiful music , and it had my favorite actor : Michael J . Fox . Now , I still love this movie , for different reasons . It has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera . It has beautiful , well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly , with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme , that still makes me cry . Even when people hum it . And it has my favorite actor , Michael J . Fox . Based on a book , this is the story of three house pets , an intelligent , overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of Shadow , a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named Sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog , Chance . The three are taken to a friend 's farm when their family goes away . Dismayed and worried , the pets break out and plan a trip across the Sierra mountains for the trip of their lives . A truly incredible journey . So what , maybe home IS just over that mountain . But what if it isn't ? I suggest Homeward Bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters , and for anyone else that .. yeah , everyone go watch it .  
  I just love Malle 's documentaries . They are so effortless and simple but still so fascinating . I have no idea why this documentary works . It is about Glencoe , Minnesota . 5000 people live there and nothing happens , really . But still Malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting . His love for humanity , even racist or homophobic people , is so overwhelming that you just can't help but also to fall in love with them too . Malle filmed most of it in 1979 . He came back 6 years later to see what had changed . This would have been a good film without the material 6 years later but this small addition makes it great . It may sound like Malle was just doing what has been done in the Up series but in fact it is not . The Up series are about people . Malle 's emphasis is not so much on what happened to each person but what has happened to this community . And the change is great . 1985 is the Reagan era and the farmers are suffering . Once a proud community , now no one sees much future at all and parents hope their children will educate them self and do something else than farming . This documentary is quite relevant today . Our financial crises today started because of what was happening then . Just take a look to these final words in the film , spoken by an older lawyer from the town ( in 1985 ) : " Well I have high hopes for this country because the things that are going on right now can only be characterized in my mind as an obsession with greed . And a nation doesn't live long with that obsession . And particularly a democracy that .. There 's good - there 's good - a lot of good in this country and a lot of good people and they aren't gonna - they aren't gonna subscribe to this philosophy of greed that 's going on now . It 's horrible . " Unfortunately it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before that happened .  
  This has to be one of the best , if not the best film i have seen for a very , very long time . Had enough action to satisfy an fan , and yet the plot was very good . I really enjoyed the film , and had me hooked from start to finish . Added blood and gore in there , but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film , and even had a tear jerker ending for many people i should think . It is a must watch for anyone . Seen many reviews , slating the film , but to be fair , most the films that get bad reviews , turn out to be some of the best . this proves it once again . Rent this film , buy this film , just go out and watch this film . You will not be disappointed .  
  Some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough . Well , if you regard it as an action movie , this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting . However , I think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one . The movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences . Tomas Beccket , who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills , looked as if he was cold-hearted . However , after Beccket showed his day dream of Montana , we can clearly see his softness inside . It was the cruel war and his partners ' sacrifice that made Beccket become so called cold-hearted . Millar , on the contrary , was a new comer , a green hand , and was even not qualified as a sniper . Billy Zane did quite well to show millar 's hesitation and fear when he first tried to " put a bullet through one 's heart " ( as what Beccket said ) . What he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award . These two guys were quite different in their personalities and I think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities . These two snipers quarreled , suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other . Sniper isn't a good action movie but a good psychological one .  
  I happened upon this movie as an 8-10 year old on a cold , dark November afternoon . I was outside playing all day , freezing , and when I came in around 4pm , I had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down in front of the TV with a blanket . I was surprised to be watching a cartoon that wasn't all happy and silly-and was in fact dark , and moralistic . It captured my imagination . I 'm sure it misses the text , and is abbreviated in all the wrong places for the Tolkien purist . But it still captures the spirit of the story , the choice to carry a burden for the good of others , the consequences of selfish , rash decisions , etc . The quality of animation leaves room for complaint . But the one place where this movie clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterizations . John Hurt is great in this . If you don't like how the character is drawn , look away , and just listen to him . His voice is extraordinary . I 've seen it again many , many times and it always brings me back to that time , as a kid , thirsty for some magical adventure . It 's for this reason I say ' lucky ' , the film is nostalgic for me so I overlook its shortcomings . But between John Hurt , and Tolkien 's fantasy , it still reached me , and still does .  
  I 'm fond of this film and it vexes me that so many " reviewers " rank it below the Peter Jackson trilogy . A filmed novel is always interpretive ; in particular an animated film relies on the artist 's vision and should be judged on its own terms . Speaking as a purist , this is a finer homage to Tolkien than the updated version . While this film has its flaws it stays truer to the source , especially so far as the characters are concerned . In the Jackson version Tolkien 's Frodo is barely recognizable : from the first scenes he is portrayed as a weakling , constantly wavering , manipulated by forces around him and never standing on his own two feet ( this is physically and metaphorically true . ) You wonder why fate chose this limp biscuit to carry the one ring to the Cracks of Doom . Jackson unforgivably rewrites Tolkien and robs Frodo of his finest moment when he allows Arwen to rescue him from the Ringwraiths .. Bakshi 's version respects the original , presenting a Frodo who demands the wraiths " Go back and trouble me no more ! " Bakshi sustains Frodo 's character as Tolkien conceived it . We see his decline as the weight of his burden increases . Frodo is so pivotal to Lord of the Rings you wonder why Jackson took such liberties ( he does so with numerous characters ) since character development propels the plot to its inevitable conclusion . Bakshi 's film better explores the companionship between Legolas and Gimli in a few judicious scenes that are completely lacking in Jackson 's version . Similarly we see Boromir horsing with Pippin and Merry , furthering the idea of fellowship . For my liking the camaraderie is more developed in the animated version than the live action . Tolkien 's poetry is an important ingredient in the novels and Bakshi makes tribute to this in one of my favorite scenes : when Frodo sings the " Merry Old Inn " song , minutes before stumbling into Strider . The cheery tune is chillingly juxtaposed with the darker theme music when seconds later , invisible to his friends but visible to the wraiths , Frodo is dangerously exposed . This is one of the most atmospheric portions of the film and chills me whenever I see it . The well documented budget / time restrictions limit this film 's final impact but had it been completed it may have resonated with more viewers . As it is , it 's worth a look . Even its detractors admit that Peter Jackson derived much of his inspiration from this prototype .  
  I was but a babe in arms when George Lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world Saga chronicling the adventures of young Luke Skywalker and the notorious Darth Vadar but even today 20 years on I can appreciate the genius that is Lucas and the incredible imagination he 's been blessed with . In A New Hope Lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky Princess Leia , the Rougish Han Solo and the spirited Luke Skywalker as well as that best loved of villains , the sinister Darth Vadar . In The Empire Strikes Back he went all out to show us Special Effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen . He made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat . Return of the Jedi is a fitting end to a Saga that will stand the test of time . When The Empire Srtikes Back ended with encasing of the lovable Rouge Han Solo in Carbonite to be delivered to Jabba the Hut and young Luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his Father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse . Vadar it seemed had won the day . How we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow ? In Lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from Han 's daring rescue from Jabba 's palace to the the final climactic battle on the Death Star between Luke and Vadar as Luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a Jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his Father 's soul . Old friends like the smooth talking Lando Calrissian and the ever lovable Chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the Emperor himself ( played by the brilliant Ian McDiarmiud . How he missed out on an Oscar is a mystery . ) desperate to turn Luke to the Dark Side even if it means betraying his apprentice Darth Vadar . All in black with his red eyes , ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed Master of the events that unfold . His new and improved Death Star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the Empire 's reign for good . Lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted . We watch in excitement as Han and Leia attempt to bring down the shield around the Death Star from the forest Moon of Endor with the help of some adorable Ewoks ( who I really do not believe take from the movie at all . In fact I feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the Death Star ) and hindered by legions of Stormtroopers and Imperial Officers . We cheer on Lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty Imperial Fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the Deatn Star to destroy it once and for all . And we watch with bated breath as Vadar and the Emperor attempt to turn Luke to the Dark Side while he in turn tries to turn his Father back . But for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside Darth Vadar . For ROTJ is a battle of emotions and feelings . Vadar is caught between his loyalty to the Emporer and the Empire and his Fatherly inclinations to Luke . Never did I think that a mask could show emotion but some-how one can't but see the confusion and pain on Vadar 's face during the final scenes as the Emporer turns on Luke . There is more depth and emotion to Vadar than I believed a villain , especially one more machine then man could have and that I think is what makes him so accessible . He is conflicted . The Apprentice as much as the Master . The Victim as much as the Villain . Without ruining the end too much Vadar 's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy . So in conclusion what can I say . George Lucas is the master of the Saga . Star Wars is the most compelling and engaging Sagas I 've seen in a long time and I have yet to see another Saga rival it . Return of the Jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending Lucas masterpiece deserves . It 's action , suspense , romance , tragedy , redemption , joy all rolled into one and it 's memorable characters , wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that Lucas can be proud of .  
  I am shocked . Shocked and dismayed that the 428 of you IMDB users who voted before me have not given this film a rating of higher than 7 . 7 ? ! ? - that 's a C ! . If I could give FOBH a 20 , I 'd gladly do it . This film ranks high atop the pantheon of modern comedy , alongside Half Baked and Mallrats , as one of the most hilarious films of all time . If you know _ anything _ about rap music - YOU MUST SEE THIS ! If you know nothing about rap music - learn something ! , and then see this ! Comparisons to ' Spinal Tap ' fail to appreciate the inspired genius of this unique film . If you liked Bob Roberts , you 'll love this . Watch it and vote it a 10 !  
  The Dentist is a really good thriller . And pretty disturbing . I think we can all agree that the chances of running into a psycho dentist are much bigger than running into monsters , vampires or zombies . That 's exactly why this movie is so scary . During this film , you 'll probably think about your own dentist a few times . Whether he 's capable of doing such things .. You better pray his wife doesn't cheat on him . That 's what the story is all about . A respected dentist in LA snaps when he finds out his wife is cheating on him with the pool-boy . ( That must be the greatest profession in the world , by the way . Poolboys always take advantage of the housewives when the husband is at his work ) From then on our dentist , Dr . Feinstone , can only thing about taking revenge . He can't concentrate on his patients anymore and a couple of them get hurt . Things aren't made easier for our dentist when he 's chased by an annoying tax-controller , a curious cop and a suspicious staff member of his . At one point , Dr . Feinstone can't take it anymore . Now he 's not only after his wife but after everyone who comes near him .. The dentist is written and directed by Brian Yuzna and co-written by Stuart Gordon . You can take that as a recommendation to itself . These 2 persons already gave us a few great horror movies ( and personal favorites of mine ) like Re-Animator , From Beyond and Society . With the Dentist , they succeed once more to bring an entertaining and very chilling thriller . This film came right on time actually . The decade hadn't brought us many great horror films so far . I 'm not at all saying this IS a masterpiece , but it 's a nice change . Corbin Bensen is great as the dentist obsessed by hygiene . I remember him mostly as a comedy or drama actor , but he can sure handle a psychotic character . The rest of the cast does good work too . The woman who plays Feinstone 's wife is really attractive . Also , it was great to see Ken Foree acting again . The actor from my all time favorite movie Dawn of the Dead plays the cop in this film . Yuzna casted him in From Beyond too , 15 years ago and I thank him for that . I don't recommend this movie to everyone ( if you have a weak stomach , I 'll advise you to skip it ) but if you do watch it , you 'll enjoy it very much . You 'll be disgusted .. but that 's an extra reason , I think . It 's been a while since I was really freaked out by watching a film . It 's a great topic to handle in the genre and Yuzna does it in a great way . Too bad this film was followed by a completely unnecessary sequel . My humble opinion on the Dentist .. 8/10  
  Director Brian Yuzna has had an uneven career in the horror genre , creating masterpieces such as " Return of the Living Dead 3 " or " Bride of Re-Animator " , but at the same time he has done awful movies such as " Faust : Love for the Damned " or the mediocre " Progeny " . He is obviously better in the seat of Producer where his work producing Stuart Gordon 's films has been superb . " The Dentist " , is one of his lesser works as director , but the low profile it has benefits the film and its lack of pretensions makes it a very enjoyable experience . It tells the story of Dr . Alan Feinstone ( played superbly by Corbin Bernsen ) , a successful dentist who one day discovers that his perfect life is not really as perfect as he thought when he discovers that his beautiful wife ( Linda Hoffman ) has an affair with the pool boy . This event disturbs his mind and puts him in a killing spree as he takes revenge on the world for being so " filthy " . The premise is very well handled by Yuzna , as he takes us on a ride following Feinstone 's day of revenge . What makes this movie different from most slashers is that we are not in the victim 's perspective , we follow Feinstone because he is the main character . We witness how he goes from respected professional to psycho murder in a day . Yuzna manages to give the movie the exact amount of suspense but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the movie . Most of the success of the premise is in Bernsen 's performance as Feinstone . He can make you feel sympathy and hate towards him at the same time , and the subtle humor his character has is another aspect that aids the film . The rest of the cast is not as good , and I think that their sub par acting hurts the film more than it should . A notable exception is Ken Foree , as the detective trying to catch Feinstone . While his part is quite small , he makes a great job with it . With a dentist as killer , gory scenes are expected , and Brian Yuzna delivers great SFX in the correct amount . It 's good to see that he does not go over-the-top with it as he usually do , and I dare to say that this is a highlight of the film . It has the exact amount of gore that is expected , nothing less and nothing more . Yuzna restrained himself of his common excesses and the result is great . While this is not among Yuzna 's most well-known films , I would say that it is one of his best . Sure , it is not classic material as his masterpieces , but it is a movie that entertains and never gets tiresome or boring . It is a low-budget simple film , but for what it is , I think it rocked . 7/10  
  * Excellent * Good * Fair * Poor ` Go Ahead , make my Day ! ' The fourth picture in the series is directed by Eastwood himself ( Who was rumored of directing most of Magnum Force ) and he brings back the violent society from the first two films . However , the film still lacks impact and believability . This film was released in the early ` 80s , the time of Regan and the young republicans . The premise of a raped woman taking vengeance on her rapist doesn't appeal to this time frame . This plot would have been better for the Enforcer , which actually would have made it a good movie . What Sudden Impact needed was a plot like in Wall Street but with Dirty Harry in the middle . RATING : 3 STARS  
  Dirty Harry has to track down a rape victim who extracts revenge by shooting her assailants in the goolies before killing them . Probably a more apt punishment would be to let them live after the initial shot and let them suffer forever like she and her sister has .. Anyway .. an action-packed story set again in San Francisco and Santa Cruz . The chief rapist , played by Andy Drake is suitably vile and gets his punishment at the end ( of course ! ) . Not a classic movie but better than the others except for the original Dirty Harry .  
  When this film was originally released it was promoted with the notably unimaginative tagline " Dirty Harry is at it again " . Whatever this pitch lacks in originality is more than compensated for by it 's complete and total accuracy . " Sudden Impact " retains all the aspects that made the previous three Dirty Harry movies so successful - tight pacing , a compelling plot , strong supporting characters , endless gunplay , and bone-dry humor . Some of these elements are not only retained but amplified - this is easily the darkest , bloodiest , and most overtly right-wing installment of the franchise . The plot is somewhat intriguing : after killing a ridiculous number of hoodlums , Inspector Callahan is sent on a forced " vacation " by his superiors to the sleepy coastal town of San Paolo . He is tasked to investigate the background of a recent homicide victim who was shot in the genitals before being put out of his ( no doubt considerable ) misery by a second shot to the head . Early on in the film , the audience is made aware of the identity of the killer - an artist named Jennifer Spencer ( Sondra Locke ) who is hunting down the thugs who gang-raped her and her sister at a fun fair some ten years earlier . This incident is shown in a very disturbing flashback , snippets of which recur before each new murder . As more bodies start to appear with the same M.O , it becomes clear to Harry that both the local police chief and his new love interest ( guess who ? ) know more than they are telling . To make matters even more complicated , the one-time rapists realize who is hunting them and start to hit back hard . " Sudden Impact " offers relentless action from beginning to end . Clint Eastwood directed this film himself and expertly handles a series of set pieces that culminate in an exhilarating climax . Sondra Locke 's performance effectively conveys the blend of ruthlessness and fragility that define her character . That having been said , it is fair to wonder if another actress ( who was not Eastwood 's off-screen companion at the time ) could have brought more charisma and dramatic weight to the role - Theresa Russell and Cybill Shepherd jump to mind as possible candidates . Members of the supporting cast that punch significantly above their weight include Albert Popwell as Harry 's partner Horace , Paul Drake as the psychopathic Mick , and the truly scene-stealing Audrie J . Neenan who portrays the vicious Ray Parkins . However the film has some notable problems - some of the subplots ( the animosity between Harry and a gang of twentysomething hoodlums , a Mob vendetta against him ) take up too much screen time and don't really have any bearing to the larger story . Their only real use is to raise the body-count to absurd levels . In the first half of the film it sometimes appears that Dirty Harry shoots people more often than he has to use the restroom . However the film moves into top gear as it progresses and the triangulated cat-and-mouse game between Callahan , Spencer , and her former tormentors assumes prominence . This second hour makes it clear that a more stripped-down and slightly refocused screenplay would have given " Sudden Impact " the potential to be a first-class , neo noir-style thriller that could have taken the series to new levels but still have contained more than enough . 44 magnum heroics to satisfy the Harry loyalists . Instead we get the film that Eastwood and Warner Bros . clearly wanted to make - a superbly executed but prototypical Eighties action flick that mostly declines to particularly challenge the intelligence of it 's intended audience . This was by far the biggest grossing of the series at the box-office and it is not hard to see why . Though not the film that it could have been , this is still big , trigger-happy fun . Even after repeated viewings , it 's going to make your day .  
  An interesting thriller that has Paul Winfield as a detective on the case of a murder . Paul Winfield was an underrated actor who pulled off all his roles with such ease , it was hard to tell the man was even acting . Maybe most known by younger viewers as the voice / narrator of " City Confidential " , Winfield ends his career with a so-so movie ; but as always , Winfield shines . A treat to watch . Erika Eliniak is well , Erika Eliniak , nice to look at but leaves a lot to be desired in the acting department . Though , to be fair , this is one of her better efforts . Bottom line : a watchable thriller that shouldn't be missed by any Paul Winfield fan . A decent telefilm to help send Paul Winfield off to celluloid heaven . What an actor . He will be missed .  
  it 's hard to tell you more about this film without spoiling it . I enjoyed it because I wasn't expecting what I was seeing , but an ordinary sex-drama so .. It 's a pscyho-sexual thriller , in which nothing is what it seems . It features Emmanuelle Seigner , no stranger to the genre ( and to nudity ) in which her husband , Polanski , had directed her . And a creepy performance ( did I say creepy / yes CREEPY ) from Toreton ( Bernard Tavernier 's actor ) . It looks like a Pascal Bruckner meets Roman Polanski ( better than Bitter Moon ) , like a Chabrol gone astray or Clouzot thriller ( I have seen someone mentioning Les Diaboliques ) , but closer to Georges Franju 's Les Yeux sans Visage ( Eyes without a face , the godfather of Dr . Phibes and more ) . A gem ! I am just afraid they will blow this into a Hollywood remake like they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing .  
  While Fred Schepisi 's " I.Q. " doesn't really have any important qualities , it 's still worth seeing . Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein , trying to help mechanic Ed Walters ( Tim Robbins ) fall in love with Princeton mathematics doctoral candidate Catherine Boyd ( Meg Ryan ) . Probably the funniest scene is when Dr . Frizzyhead and friends ( Lou Jacobi , Gene Saks and Joseph Maher ) try to make Ed look like a scientist : he ends up looking like a French impressionist . Obviously little of the movie is historically accurate , but that 's not the point . It 's not intended as anything except a light comedy , quite the opposite of Robbins 's most famous movie from 1994 ( The Shawshank Redemption ) . A movie about Einstein 's whole life would have to focus not only on his scientific achievements , but also his political activism , namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons ( it got to the point where the FBI kept a file on him ) . So anyway , this one is acceptable . Also starring Stephen Fry , Tony Shalhoub , Frank Whaley , Charles Durning and Keene Curtis .  
  A solid , if unremarkable film . Matthau , as Einstein , was wonderful . My favorite part , and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again , was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badmitton , I loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to retrieve the birdie .  
  Maybe I 'm being too generous with the rating .. but I just love this movie ! I 've seen it so many times , but every time I see it I fall in love with it all over again . It 's just a simple romantic comedy , with nothing huge or monumentous that happens . But I 'm a big romantic and this movie * is * romantic . I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins , and Walter Mathau is so funny . The scientists make me laugh so much .. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it . It 's such a clean , good movie - and those are so rare now ! My 20-year-old brother likes this movie , too , so it 's not just a chick-flick . ; - ) I recommend it if you need to laugh , or if you 're just lonely and need to * watch * a romance , if you yourself can't participate in one . It 's a good ' un !  
  Yep , you read that right , kids . Michael Bay should 've studied this film before making either of his over hyped , overlong , overly pointless " Transformers " movies . " Robot Jox " is better than both of them and it probably cost less than the " Transformers " crew spent on Megan Fox 's personal trainer . Thankfully , this little robotic gem , initially known mainly for being the film that bankrupted Charles and Albert Band 's Empire Pictures studio , seems to have developed a cult following over the years . I fondly remember watching it on VHS during its initial video release in the early 90s and though some of the Cold War-era politics / stereotypes were already out of date by that time ( just the Bands ' luck that Communism would fall while the film was sitting on a shelf waiting to be released , eh ? ) , it 's still a pretty damn cool little B-Movie . They really don't make'em like this anymore , or if they do , they go the Bay route and CGI things to unbearable proportions . For those who are unfamiliar , here 's the Robo-scoop : We 're somewhere in the future and after a nuclear holocaust , large scale " wars " have been outlawed . Disputes between nations are now settled mano-a-mano ( or perhaps that should be machine o machine o ) by one representative from each side battling each other in giant sized Shogun Warrior style robots . Whichever ' bot walks away from the fight wins for " his " side . Gary Graham ( who would later go on to play Detective Sykes in the " Alien Nation " TV series ) , plays " Achilles , " the greatest Robot Jock in Marketplace ( a . k . a . the good guys ) history . Achilles has been undefeated in his previous nine Robot bouts ( ten being the maximum number of battles before a " Jock " is retired ) and at the beginning of the film he faces off against his counterpart from the " Confederation " ( i . e . The Russkies ! ) , the psychotic Alexander ( who is the most over the top " evil Russian " stereotype bad guy since Dolph Lundgren 's infamous turn as Ivan Drago in " Rocky IV " ) . The match is called a draw when Alexander violates the rules with an illegal Robot Move at the last minute and ends up not only embarrassing Achilles , but killing a whole bunch of spectators in the bargain . A rematch is scheduled to complete the bout , but Achilles simply wants to bow out , hang up his helmet and move on with his life . Rather than violate the Spoiler Rules by revealing much more , I will simply say that there are a great deal of twists and turns , behind the scenes skullduggery , and other difficulties for Achilles and his fellow " Jox " before the two robotic titans clash finally once again in the finale . I hope I 'm not making this movie out to be some sort of masterpiece of science fiction , because it isn't . " Robot Jox " is just plain fun . I 'll grant that it is a bit higher-concept than your average B-grade sci-fi movie , and though the budgetary constraints do occasionally make themselves known ( especially in the scenes involving some painfully obvious green-screen trickery ) , it is still the best looking movie ever to come out of the Empire / Full Moon Pictures factory . The robot fight scenes are very well done using old school stop motion / model techniques , and the sets and costumes don't look half-assed in the slightest . Empire Pictures and director Stuart ( " Re-Animator " ) Gordon were definitely shooting for the stars with this picture . Unfortunately it didn't quite pan out for them ( or the studio ) but at least we got one heckuva cool little movie out of the deal . Bottom line : if you want to be aurally and visually assaulted for 2 + hours , feel free to rent a " Transformers " movie . By the end you 're likely to feel like you 've spent all that time watching someone else play a video game . If you want to have a rock'em , sock'em robot good time , pick up Robot Jox instead .  
  Hrm-I think that line was from the old movie posters . This is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator . Here 's a tip : Any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading " In the future .. " is going to be fun . This means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you . In this case , " In the future .. " means that , instead of fighting wars , nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine , well , that 's never terribly clear , but it 's probably something really important . There are good guys ( obviously capitalists , i . e . " us " ) and bad guys ( Commies ! ) and there are big stop-motion robots . Sadly , the effects budget was pretty slim , so we don't get to see a lot of the big robots . There are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes , and then a big space fight near the end . The space fight is especially nice , as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget . With said money now spent , the climactic fight degenerates into ( and I 'm not making this up ) two guys hitting each other with sticks . I can always get a laugh in a bar by re-enacting the final scene , complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads . Like I said-it 's dumb . That 's why I bought the tape .  
  One of the best movies out there . Yeah maybe the cinematography wasn't the greatest , but an excellent plot and concept . Great for the time and brilliant and creative ideas . Something different from the usual movies and great fun . One of my favorites and would recommend to anyone who likes creative and imaginative movies . Post World War 3 and fighting in gigantic robots , the actors gave a great performance and made it all worth while . The sets are not amazing , but simple and worked for the overall look of the film . This movie is very hard to find on DVD , but also on VHS . Check it out cause I have loved it since it came out . Not a mainstream flick and not like anything you 've ever seen . Take a look and think like a child . It 's a great view and very fun .  
  What a great film it is . The notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky . The ending is not just a fitting one , it 's more inspirational . But I am intrigued by the characters . It is a pity we never see the relationship of Achilles and Athena more developed beyond just a couple of kisses and Athena 's fear for Achilles 's safety . Their romance is very enjoyable .  
  If you like mech war games it 's pretty good . Some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing . I 've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie I 've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs . If you like the genera then games you like are Mech Warrior Three and four and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 to spare Steel Battalion . The movie is worth seeing at least once . There really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there . Less remakes and more original works . Enjoy  
  I have always been a huge fan of " Homicide : Life On The Street " so when I heard there was a reunion movie coming up , I couldn't wait . Let me just say , I was not disappointed at all . It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I 've ever seen . It was great to see everyone back again , but the biggest pleasure of all was to have Andre Braugher back , because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always the strongest part of an all-together great show .  
  * Spoilers * My dad had taped this movie for me when I was 3 . By age 5 , I had watched it over 400 times . I just watched it and watched it . And I still do today ! It has a grim storyline , a lamb 's mother is killed by a wolf-a very emotional scene-and wants to become a wolf , like him . After years of training , the lamb is made into a really REALLY evil looking thing . He and the wolf travel to his old barn , but he cannot kill the lambs , no matter how much he wishes to . He ends up killing the wolf , but is no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends , and can't return to his previous way of life . The art is beautiful , the songs are .. well , okay , and the voice acting is better than some things today . All in all , you just * have * to see this movie , it is a great masterpiece . Although , it 's very hard to find today .  
  This comedy is bound to be good from the get-go . East meets west and east doesn't want to lose .. west doesn't know what losing is like . It starts a little slow but it grabs you very soon and it doesn't let go . This is definitely worth seeing .  
  The cast was good , and I thought it was a good performance from Christopher Lloyd , whom I like from previous movies . The movie was a great family movie , nothing that would make you worry to show it to younger kids , a good story line , lots of laughs , lighthearted and enjoyable . If you want to entertain children without being bored to tears this fits the bill . Kid pleasing , and not difficult for a parent to watch , either .  
  This work is a bold look into the mindset of men who find themselves in wheelchairs . This film never tries to tone it down , cotton candy-ize , or soft soap the angst , confusion , and pain of what these guys live with . That is its strength , I think . But more so , the performances are fantastic , with well conceived and delivered dialog , which draws you in and makes you feel a part of the experience . The characters never attempt to block out the audience from knowing what 's on their mind-what 's in their hearts . I found it plodding , but enjoyable . It rates a 6.6/10 from .. the Fiend : .  
  I thought this was an excellent and very honest portrayal of paralysis and racism . This movie never panders to the audience and never gets predictable . The acting was top-notch and the movie reminded me of " One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest " .  
  My observations : vamp outfit at end is ravishing and wonderful , exotic and fantastic . Jeanette wore it well , and got even with naive Nelson . Boat crashing into his balcony served him right . Costume outfits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well , especially by today 's standards . 1942 costume designer did great job . Main song theme just lovely . Caution to negative posters : 1942 was time of WW II ; Pearl Harbor happened year before . U.S. just coming out of Great Depression ; needed to get out and spend that hard earned money on diversion of singing , dance and yes , fantastic fantasy . Despotic dictators were trying to rule out there in RL , snuffing out freedoms . Thank goodness the public had these fantastic plot line movies to attend . Movie going was a privileged treat , in those depressing times . When you , negative posters , become actors or even movie stars , then YOU have room to talk and criticize . Jeanette 's and Nelson 's movies stand the test of time . Angel wings wonderful , on the real angel . RL wings at costume party not so hot , but great on Jeanette considering the SL . Beautiful singing by Jeanette and Nelson , as always . Jeanette dancing was a pure delight . 15/10  
  It appears that there 's no middle ground on this movie ! Most of it takes place in a dream and , like most dreams , it 's often foolish and illogical . It 's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances , especially by our angel . Jeanette 's deadpan , unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious , and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight . At one point , she gets to sing a snippet from Carmen , followed by the final trio of Faust ( holding a lapdog , for some strange reason ) , then " Aloha Oe " on the beach ! It 's a surreal comedy-tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove .  
  If this is supposed to be a portrayal of the American serial killer , it comes across as decidedly average . A journalist [ Duchovny ] travels across country to California to document America 's most famous murderers , unaware that one of his white trailer trash travelling companions [ Pitt ] is a serial killer himself . Rather predictable throughout , this has its moments of action and Pitt and Lewis portray their roles well , but I 'd not bother to see it again .  
  This cartoon is short on plot , but is a visually stunning piece of work . There will be very , very minor spoilers : This short has a " story " that 's incredibly slight-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year , yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw . Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs . That 's pretty much the plot , such as it is . But this cartoon isn't about the plot-it 's about the color and animation . The visuals are exceptional . Back in 1936 , such bright color was still something of a novelty and there 's some incredibly inspired work here . My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes . At more than one point , there are a series of pipes aligned in a row , from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ . The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed . These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for , but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM , because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were . This is truly a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing . It 's available on the DVD Attack of the ' 30s Characters . Recommended , particularly if you like good animation .  
  One of the unsung gems of the 1980 's , Scenes .. features razor-sharp satire and outstanding performances from Arnetia Walker ( how did she not get a ton of roles after this ? ) and Wallace Shawn . It 's a delicious send-up of class warfare and the people in those classes . The writing is hilarious and the characters , while not subtle , are nuanced . And , sorry , but the Asian gangs ( if you can call one Japanese guy extorting one of the other characters a " gang " ) were not put in for " sociological value " as another review implies they should been . The value here lies in what the movie is making fun of and in the sparklingly wicked way it does it . I found it creative , funny , and idiosyncratic .  
  For everyone who expects a traditional superhero-movie it might be an unpleasant surprise . It is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie . It focuses mainly on emotions and it 's a bit like a Greek tragedy - whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow . That 's because Sasha , like each superhero , takes the law into his own hands and the society doesn't appreciate it . Sasha becomes an outlaw . While on the run , he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him . As you can see , the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics . It reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by Ram Gopal Varma . Everything happens very slowly . However , when there 's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what 's going on , it 's all over . But the director does not want to impress us with flashy and showy action . What is more important here is the outcome of Sasha 's actions , which are mostly very drastic . The score is very scarce , which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film . So basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it . Is the film worth it ? That is a question really difficult to answer . I don't think that this experience enriched me so very much , but somehow I keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again . Mostly due to the atmosphere , which is really dense , but not suffocating because all the time Sasha and Katya have hope . After all they 're young people , who have all their lives to live . So no matter how hard it gets there 's always a slight joyous tune when they are together .  
  Carla works for a property developer 's where she excels in being unattractive , unappreciated and desperate . She is also deaf . Her boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company . Help arrives in the form of Paul , a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environment . An implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and Carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week . When Carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits Paul 's criminality by having him steal the contract back . The colleague quickly realises that she 's behind the robbery , but when he confronts her , Paul 's readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price . Paul is given a ' going over ' by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt . He formulates a plan which utilises Carla 's unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers . It 's now Carla 's turn to enter a frightening new world . The fourth feature from director Jacques Audiard , ' READ MY LIPS ' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners . The leads are excellent ; effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect . Carla 's first meeting with Paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was , until very recently , a jailbird . Emmanuelle Devos , who plays Carla , has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame . Vincent Cassel plays Paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he 's receiving a beating or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him killed . Like many French films , ' READ MY LIPS ' appears , at first , to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it 's probably about everything . The only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of Paul 's parole officer ; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac . It was the French ' New Wave ' of the 60 's that first introduced the concept of ' genre ' to film making and I 've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it ; so it 's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre , or better still , defy it .  
  You will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation , and the novelty probably won't wear off on the first , second or third viewing , but you ? ll be drawn in by the characters which are so simple yet intriguing , that you may find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way , which may or may not make you feel a little childish due to the medium . Disney continues to firmly hold the title of " Greatest Animation in the World " , with " A Bug ? s Life " standing as one of their greatest achievements . One of the innovative attachments being the delightful " out-takes " added to the end of the film . The DVD has two sets of these out-takes where as I ? m told the VHS cassette has one alternating version per tape . The DVD also features " Gerry ? s Game " which is a delightful little PIXAR short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters . This is by far the superior insect-film in comparison to Dreamworks ? " Antz " , which in all fairness is pretty good , but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters . If you look at the star voices of both films , " Antz " is largely cast with big name " movie " stars with a few familiar " TV " star voices , where " A Bug ? s Life " is just the opposite , loaded with " TV " stars with Kevin Spacey as the only stand out exception . But the difference in quality is distinct and obvious . Dreamworks can ? t be blamed or surprised though , when you go head to head with Disney , you have your work cut out for you . This is the kind of film that almost makes me wish I had children to share it with . Don ? t think for a second that this is just a movie for kids , though .  
  Loosely based on the James J Corbett biography " The Roar Of The Crowd " , Gentleman Jim is a wonderfully breezy picture that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of the pugilistic prancer that was Corbett , but also the wind of change as regards the sport of boxing circa the 1890s . The story follows Corbett { a perfectly casted Errol Flynn } from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in San Fransico , thru to a chance fight with an ex boxing champion that eventually leads to him fighting the fearsome heavyweight champion of the world , John L Sullivan { beefcake personified delightfully by Ward Bond } . Not all the fights are in the ring tho , and it 's all the spin off vignettes in Corbett 's life that makes this a grand entertaining picture . There are class issues to overcome here { perfectly played out as fellow club members pay to have him knocked down a peg or two } , and Corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his so called peers , but he must also overcome his ego as it grows as briskly as his reputation does . Along with the quite wonderful Corbett family , and all their stoic humorous support , Corbett 's journey is as enthralling as it is joyous , yet as brash and as bold as he is , he is a very likable character , and it 's a character that befits the tagged moniker he got of Gentleman Jim . The film never sags for one moment , and it 's a testament to director Raoul Walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight , the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained , not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture { thank you Alexis Smith } . The fight sequences stand up really well , and they perfectly show just how Corbett became the champ he was , his brand of dancing rings round slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history . As the final reel rolls we all come down to earth as an after fight meeting between Sullivan and Corbett puts all the brutality into context , and it 's here where humility and humbleness becomes the outright winner , and as far as this viewer goes .. it will do for me to be sure to be sure , 9/10 for a truly wonderful picture .  
  Everything is relative seems to be the main theme from the outset by this set of eleven pieces by eleven directors . That is to say that what might be number one priority for people like Bush , Blair and Company , may not be so for a great many other people , ordinary people . From the opening scene in which an Iranian teacher is trying to impress on her little students the most important thing that has happened , with the result the children are not impressed , as the death of a neighbour and things like that evidently affect them much more closely than anything which may have happened in New York , USA , wherever that is , this series of almost documentary styled pieces establishes that not all things are as equal unto all men as some world leaders would try to prophess . Whereas , obviously , the attack on the WTC was a dastardly event by any yardstick , one does get the impression that both politicians and TV cameramen tend to blow up things out of all proportion - wonderfully manifested in one of these pieces . Would the same reaction at international level have occurred if the attack had been made on Lagos , say , or Djakarta , say , or even on Rio de Janeiro , say ? I rather think not . News seems to suffer distortion depending on where things happen : much more TV time is given to an earthquake in Italy , say , than one ten times more destructive in Outer Mongolia , say . Greater distances seem to decrease the magnitude of the disaster . This series of eleven pieces helps to put things in better perspective - or , perhaps I should say , some of the pieces do , as each director with complete freedom has made up his own story , his own translated perspective , such that it is not possible to judge the whole merits , but individually for each eleven-minute segment . In no way should one deduce that this is an anti-American film : that would be a too simple reading of the diverse messages manifested through the segments . However , it is not pro-American either . The eleven segments adopt varied attitudes and the common link - if there is one - is that the disaster of the WTC attack has to be seen in perspective from different view-points . Only then will such people as George Bush even begin to comprehend the planet he is living on . Clearly stated in one segment is a belief of mine I have been harbouring for two years now : America has not learnt the lesson . And the lesson is that the USA has to share this planet with the rest of humanity - not dominate it by ruthless economical persuasion or just plain force . Instead of learning that the USA cannot continue just stamping all over everybody and everywhere , its political leaders , aided and abetted by Blair ( and even Aznar ) have become even more arrogant and even more intolerant , which is not doing any good to anyone in Afghanistan or Irak at present , let alone much elsewhere . The White House mentality is totally rejectable : the US and UK invaded Irak and caused all the chaos , and so should clear up the mess they caused - not insist on the UN and other nations to delve in with a helping hand and thus find an easy way out of the turmoil . Radical stances adopted by the US ( or even Israel ) is only going to be met by radical stances from Islamic people , who for years have been gearing up fanatical fundamentalism , if only to cover up their own macho uselessness , i . e . , stoning women to death or simply shrouding them from the tops of their heads to the dusty ground . The world is in a terrible mess , fueled by the greed of a few rich countries who seem bent on not seeing or understanding anything from more multilateral perspectives . This film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this dismal and dumb posture .  
  First of all , I don't understand why some people find this movie so anti-american . Sure , there are moments when the U.S. are accused directly , like at the segments of Youssef Chahine , Ken Loach and , to a certain extent , Mira Nair . But come on , they aren't naive accusations ; instead , they are based on real and documented facts , and all the documents that the CIA released about Chile confirms this , for example . But returning to the film itself , what I enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it . We find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event ; we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day ; we find common people that have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently to this , with dignity or frustration ; we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happiness . All these visions and others - as powerful as these or even more - make a consistent blend and help the spectator to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world reacted to the events of September 11th . Thus , what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks , and this may make some people infuriated ; but this is the world where we live , and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideologies , regardless of what presidents or priests may say us . Finally , I think it 's a shame that there isn't even a release date for this movie in the United States of America . It 's a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened , and this movie could give some clues to them . This film puts very clearly - differently of what some people of this forum think - that everything we do today will determine our future , and that the errors of the past will affect how we live today .  
  The Hanson brothers - Andy ( apparently has his act together ) and Hank ( clearly doesn't have his act together ) need money . Andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole Hanson family . This film delivers . This is a layered , full-blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing . As a crime drama / thriller I would happily compare it to ' No Country For Old Men . ' While both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills , ' Devil ' is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace . ' No Country ' is a colder and bleaker film that you can really admire , while ' Devil ' is a bit more enjoyable . There is definitely less violence in ' Devil ' than ' No Country . ' The acting delivers as well . Ethan Hawke , sometimes wooden in the past , brings the jitters , sweating and the deer in the headlights look to the besieged Hank . Philip Seymour Hoffman , as Andy , has the film 's hardest scenes and is fast becoming the actor , who you believe can do anything . There 's really not much wrong with this film . It jumps back and forth without being confusing . Events spiral out of control , but the film never does - the writing ( from first timer Kelly Masterson ) , directing ( veteran Sidney Lumet ) and the editing stay as tight as a drum . In many categories , this is award caliber stuff , though maybe films like ' The Departed ' and ' No Country ' squeezed this one out of the limelight . If you liked those , you 'll like this .  
  I am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of 2007 's films . If 2004 was the year of the biographies and 2005 was the year of the political films , 2007 can be identified as a year featuring a wide plethora of morality tales , films that portray , test , challenge and question human morality and the motives that drive us to do certain things . Although this identification is rather broad , I think that there are a handful of films released this year , such as 3:10 To Yuma , Eastern Promises , American Gangster , No Country for Old Men and others that specifically question and study human morals and the motives that drive us to acts such as violence or treachery . Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead is a deviously stylish morality tale , and quite a dark , bleak and depressing one at that . And even better is the fact that it comes from one of the greatest classic directorial forces of our time , the legendary Sidney Lumet , who many have said has passed his prime but returns in full force with this viciously rich crime thriller . It 's one of those films whose plots are so thick , that one is very reluctant to go into details . It is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold , as there are twists and turns . But the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film ; the true focus is , as I mentioned , the morality tale ; the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film . In a plot structured like a combination between the filmographies of both The Coen Brothers ( namely Blood Simple and Fargo ) and Quentin Tarantino , we see two men driven under various shady circumstances to pull off a fairly simple crime that goes incredibly , ridiculously wrong , and reciprocates with full force and inevitable tragedy . And to make it all the more interesting , the film is told in a fragmented chronology that keeps back tracking and showing a series of events following a different character every time and always ending up where it left off the last time . Sizzling , sharp , thick and precariously depressing , Kelly Masterson 's screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded , in particular because it is a debut screenplay . But the film has much more going for it than just it 's delectably sinister and quite depressing plot . First and foremost , the picture looks and feels outstandingly well . Sidney Lumet has , throughout his career , consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting : naturalistic and yet stylish at the same time . The film carries with it a distinctive air of style and class , with wonderful natural lighting that just looks really great . Editing is top-notch ; combining the sizzling drama-thriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action accordingly . And vivid , dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style . The film is also backed by a fantastically succulent musical score by Carter Burwell . The screenplay does its part , and of course Lumet does his part , but at the film 's dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances . First and foremost , there are the two leads . Leading the pack is Philip Seymour Hoffman , who has always been an excellent actor but has stumbled upon newfound leading-man status after his unnaturally fantastic Oscar-winning performance in Capote . His turn in this film is fascinating : severely flawed , broken , manic . Hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out , and not just his subtlety and wit . At his side is Ethan Hawke , who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater , grander actors . Here , he bounces off Hoffman and complements him so incredibly well ; in all , the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing , the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that it 's watching actors . And then there 's Albert Finney . Such a supple , opulent supporting role like the one he has requires a veteran professional and here Finney delivers his finest performance in many years as the tragically obsessed father to the two brothers who get caught up in the crime . I love how the dynamics between the three of them play out . I love how Hoffman is clearly the dominant brother and shamelessly picks on his younger brother even now that they 're middle-aged men ; and yet despite this , it is clear how Finney 's father favours Hawke 's younger , weaker brother . Also on the topic of the cast , the two supporting female characters  wives of the brothers  also feature fantastic performances from Amy Ryan and Marisa Tomei , whose looks just get better and better as the years go by . This film isn't revolutionary . These themes and this style have already been explored by the likes of The Coen Brothers , and it 's very easy to imagine them directing this film . But for a film that treads familiar ground , it simply excels . Lumet employs his own immense directorial talent and employs his unique and very subtle sense of irony and style to Masterson 's brilliantly vivid , intense , and morbidly depressing first-time screenplay . The lead performances are incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turns from Hoffman , Hawke and Finney ; but the truly greatest wonder of the film is that three years after he won a Lifetime Achievement Oscar , much revered as the ultimate sign of retirement in the film business , Sidney Lumet proves that he still has the immense talent to deliver a truly wonderful , resonant , intense piece of cinema reminiscent of his golden years .  
  This impossible tale is of a female witch pursuing a mortal man , in a mortal world . Her " community " is open among it 's members , but she conceals her witchcraft from the mortals . Hmm .. this is starting to sound familiar . LOL . It 's not your typical movie . Very " campy " performances by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs keep things from getting dull . Kim Novak is always a pleasure on screen , but I found her pairing with James Stewart unusual ( but not fatal to the story ) . With re-newed interest in all things witchy and dark , this film deserves to be discovered and re-discovered by old and new audiences .. IT 'S STILL A HOOT !  
  Anton Newcombe and Courtney Taylor are friends , they both are the leads in their own respective bands ; Anton with The Brian Jonestown Massacre and Courtney with The Dandy Warhols . What 's interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals ; its a love hate relationship . At times you both hear them praising one another , but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are . While the Dandy Warhols went on the reach commercial success , BJM still was stuck in the underground scene ; and for good reason why . The focus of Dig ! is more towards Anton and the BJM , as they have a lot more substance . They are the most dysfunctional band . During gigs they will fight and bash each other . Anton will hit other members if he feels they aren't performing correctly . With the amount of drugs an alcohol they consume , fight was always waiting to happen . You know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens ; that 's why people would go to their gigs , for the fights . Anton is very unstable . Always thinking himself as a music messiah , he wants to change music and create a revolution , but he could never get out of the underground . He is a very talented musician , its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill . But his draw back is he cant escape the world he created ; a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs , alcohol and depression . On the other side , the Dandy Warhols were having their own troubles . They didn't find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label . But they found huge success in Europe . But Courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of Anton . Its interesting that both Anton and Courtney both had what the other needed . Courtney always wanted to be musically talented as Anton , though Anton wouldn't say it , he needed the commercial success that the Dandy 's had , to make his revolution . Over the seven year course the film crew followed these two bands , there is a lot of footage . There is never a dull moment in Dig ! . It is constantly moving along as it doesn't have time to slow down as it has to much to say , seven years of story telling in the 1h 45mins is a hard job . Ondi Timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more . Even if you don't like the bands it still deserves viewing ; it transcends the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure . You wont be disappointed .  
  I saw this film without to know what about were .. I 'm a fan of Branagh , even more his Shakespeare ' films , and , in the beginning , I saw it only for this .. and I finished with tears in my eyes , because the great , great serenity , values , affect and brave philosophy about Life of Helena 's girl . Recommended to people who are bored with TV programming ( in Spain , at least ) .  
  I found this movie quite by accident , but am happy that I did . Kenneth Branagh 's performance came close to stealing this movie from Helena Bonham Carter , but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie . This movie brought to mind the excellent movies that Branagh made with Emma Thompson . Carter 's star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as I have seen from a female lead in a long time . Portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off , but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life , she made it so believable . If this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women " uglying " themselves up for roles ( Charlize Theron , Halle Berry ) , I fell sure Carter would have had strong consideration for an Oscar . If you run across this movie on cable late at night as I did , trust me , it is worth the lost sleep .  
  Shamefully , before I saw this film , I was unfamiliar with Helena Bonham Carter . I had to do some research , in order to assure myself she wasn't actually afflicted , as was her character , with ( well ? ) , what she was afflicted with . I was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady . She pulled it of flawlessly . Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants , and needs , of a unique young lady , could be interpreted as tender , and romantic ? Well , they can be , when the right performers present them in the proper manner , as they did in this wonderful movie . I forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful Miss Carter looked in this movie . I have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have ever graced the face of our earth , but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie . I hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as I did . Thank you for letting me express my opinion .  
  So we compromised . This was a fairly charming film , I liked the art direction ( it felt far more " real " than most kids movies ) , and the costumes weren't too cutesy . The child actors were not bad to watch ( the adult performances trended toward cheesy ) . It was great that they showed how a bullied kid bullies others as well as kids standing up to bullying . I don't know how many grown ups would want to see this for themselves , but it 's a great film to take a kid to . And since " Barnyard " was apparently attended by 100 + kids at the same time , I 'm REALLY glad we picked the sparsely attended showing of " worms " instead .  
  I read the book in 5th grade and now a few years later I saw the movie . There are a few differences : 1 . Billy was oringinally suppose to eat 15 worms in 15 days , not 10 worms in one day by 7:00pm . 2 . Billy is suppose to get 30 dollars after he 's eaten all the worms . In the movie after Billy eats all the worms , Joe has to go to school with worms in his pants . 3 . Joe is suppose to fake some of the worms but in the movie , he doesn't at all . Even though there are changes , this movie is still one that kids will enjoy .  
  If you like Sci-Fi , Monsters , and Ancient Legends , then you will love this movie ! The Special Effects are by far the best I have seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago . While the acting may have been a little less than desirable , the story line and effects adequately compensated for it . I wish now I had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen TV . If you like non-stop action , awesome visuals , and taste for myth and lore .. you have to see this movie !  
  Principally it is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution . It was easy to understand the contest , but usually directors starts from a historical fact to speak about something else , or they shows also the period before or after this fact , here everything happen during that couple of days when the revolution acts . It could also be seen as a kind of documentary . The movie focalize to these two people , showing as normal they were , not like common heroes , because the revolution come from people . Although it was made from military army from the title you can understand that they were just " capitaes " as the main characters . Nice colors and lights during the whole movie , excellent work for the director being her first movie , she doesn't fall to the banal way . Well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd . The character of Maia ( main one ) is well-made and there is also a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi , able to show Maia 's limits , this not-being an hero .  
  You know ? Our spirit is based on that revolution , it 's asleep .. I can explain , I think ! Well .. Until that happen on 25th April 1974 , our freedom was limited , we didn't had liberty of speech , but when we got it at the revolution , it seems that Portuguese People lost his opinion , we don't use our liberty of speech ! That 's all a consequence of the revolution ! I think that 's clear ! .. About the movie .. I think that it has a few mistakes on some character 's acting , but by the way I use to watch on Portuguese movies it 's quite good ! I like it very much !  
  Probably the first Portuguese film I have seen in my life , and I enjoyed it . The plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974 , to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies , i . e . Mozambique , Angola , and Guinea ( Bissau ) - Cape Vert . Most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup , of the oppressed people , who were very happy with this new development and the liberty , the resistance of Caetano 's men , and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials , including Spinola , who took over as the new president . The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers , but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that Portugal should develop itself democratically , and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution . The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone ; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end .  
  Ok , so it may not be the award-winning " movie of the year " type-film ( apart from the brilliant soundtrack that I think won a few awards ) , but it is a really great film about ' The Kid ' ( Prince / O ( take your pick ) and the happenings around him living in Minneapolis , playing his music . The music is absolutely superb , in my opinion you HAVE to own this soundtrack , it is truly a classic and sums up the eighties sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion . And the movie itself plays out a nice plot , it 's worth seeing over and over again , espeically if you like Prince / O ( which I do ) of course .  
  All the talent Mr . Sooraj Barjatya showed in his first 3 movies , I thought were all an accident because his 4th one Main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad . But I have to say it wasn't an accident . This guy is talented and the way he has done Vivah is just brilliant . Right from the first scene it affects you . the sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome . The chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between srk and kajol . As usual Alok Nath as the good and loving father is fantastic , so is Anupam Kher . But its a Shahid-Amrita film . Amrita looks good in most scenes though shahid does look a little young to get married but he does a good job of a shy but yet morally strong groom . this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life . All in all a brilliant film . hats off to Mr . Sooraj Barjatya ..  
  I am a Jane Eyre lover and a purist , and this version includes almost all of the important details of the book , and the characters are portrayed as I imagined them . Jane Eyre is a complex story of great richness and can't be delivered properly in a feature-length format , so it needs a TV mini-series . Timothy Dalton 's Rochester is probably the best ever . There has been a lot of discussion about how attractive he is and his age . In the book , Jane ( the narrator ) describes him as " about 35 " and not young , but not yet middle aged . I think Timothy Dalton was about 38 when he made this , so that is about right . Also , we only have Jane 's opinion of whether Rochester is handsome . She only just met him and he asks her bluntly what she thinks . As an inexperienced and humble girl , I can't imagine her saying she did think him handsome . The actor playing Rochester needs to show us the character of the man , and this is fulfilled to perfection . I love the relationship between the two leads , which is the crucial thing about this story , and the humour of their encounters . Other versions have blown it , but this gets it right . The 2006 version with Toby Stephens ( aged 37 years ) is in progress on BBC1 and is very good indeed , so I will decide whether that is my favourite when it is completed . On viewing this series again , after watching the 2006 version , I have decided that this version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is the best ! Charlotte Bronte 's dialogue is preserved and this is essential to the power of the story . Modernisation just doesn't work - it 's a Victorian story and having archaic poetic speech suits the characters . This version has an excellent cast - Zelah Clark is tiny and the difference in height between her and Rochester is important ; Timothy Dalton has real presence and is an amazing actor . There are no extra scenes to divert from the plot and the screenplay includes all the essential scenes , but leaves out unnecessary details , making it to the point and gripping . I recommend it to all true Jane Eyre fans .  
  Let me start off by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on DVD at 10 o'clock P.M. one night , I could not fall asleep until about 3:00 A.M. This brief review may contain spoilers . I 'm a long-time fan of The Sopranos and I can safely say this is the best episode I 've seen . I 'm not saying everyone should feel this way , but I do . This episode is identical to the weekend I spent with my family , watching over my own father , comatose in the ICU before he passed . The episode begins with Tony in an alternate reality : he is a salesman who 's identity has been mistaken for that of a man named Kevin Finnerty . By the time ten minutes had gone by , I knew either Tony was dreaming , or I was watching some other show . It wasn't like the normal Sopranos and I loved it . Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony ( or " Kevin " ) looks into the sky at a " helicopter spotlight " and we see prodding through it , a doctor with a flashlight . We see this only for a moment and the sequence plays out until we go back to real life in a situation similar to the one I just stated . Tony has come out of the coma for only a moment . His boys take A.J. home and Carmella , overcome by stress , breaks down in the hallway : a signature moment in the episode . For the remainder of the episode , we cut in between the real world : the family dealing with the potential negative outcome of this coma , and Tony 's alternate reality , which parallels what 's going on both in his mind and in the real world around him . Then comes the stellar point in the episode : after A.J. finishes telling his mother he 's flunked school , she walks in to see Meadow sitting at Anthony 's side . She approaches Tony , and utters the best line of the episode : " Anthony , can you hear us ? " In Tony 's world , he enters a dark hotel room and turns on a light . He takes off his shoes and goes to the phone . He tries to dial , but he cannot-as if he were trying to say something back to Carmella , but couldn't physically bring himself to do so . Not yet . He sits down and looks out his window . A shimmering light that has reoccurred throughout the episode now seems to call to him from the other side of the city . " When It 's Cold I 'd Like To Die " by Moby marries perfectly with these last images and helps in creating an emotional roller-coaster of an episode . 10 out of 10 . P.S. : Watch the next episode . You find out what the light is . It 's wonderful .  
  Dead To Rights is about a Police Officer named Jack Slate who finds his murdered father and goes after the man that he thinks killed him . Jack is later shot and framed for the murder of the man he suspected of killing his father . Several months later on the day Jack is going to be executed he escapes from prison and searches the city for the man who framed him for murder . Jack 's search leads him through a trail of * beep * that doesn't end until everyone is dead . Through out the game Jack uses weapons from M4 Carbines to his dog Shadow to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels . The game play is basically " kill 30 people , find switch to open door . kill 50 people , find switch to open door " over and over until the level is done . There are fun mini games too like playing as a stripper to distract bouncers at a Night Club so Jack can get to another area in the club , or bomb disarming . Dead To Rights is also a hard game . You will be put in an area swarming with bad guys armed with Sub Machine Guns while you only have a pistol . Near the end of the game skill turns to dust and you have to rely on luck . Dead To Rights is as gory as it is hard . If you shoot a guy in the face with a shot gun blood will splatter on the walls , ceiling and floor . And since there are several guys in each area the walls will be painted in blood . Family fun for everyone .  
  This one grew on me . I love the R.D. Burman music and in spite of the cruder elements of the story I found much to be moved by as I kept re-watching the movie . The brother-sister plot line is powerful , I thought ; there 's also more probably obligatory stuff , like bar fights , a loony crime story , etc . that are just distracting . ( Though not unfunny from a certain point of view . ) Also the English translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit of a stretch , and as loony as it is I am grateful to him for doing it . Like many of the Bollywood movies I 've seen , this one is melodramatic and opera-like , including here notably a song sung first by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister , and then the same song sung 12 or so years later by the man who has travelled to Kathmandu seeking to re-connect with this girl , grown up and troubled ( she had been told her brother and mother were dead ) , numbing her pain with drugs . A super thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement , which brought hordes of seekers to India , from an Indian point of view , that sees them as people driven to India by a spiritual hunger aroused by the failings of their own societies , but nonetheless , in India , living only for the pleasures of the moment . The hippie singing-dancing-drugging scenes are truly wonderful , and accurate in their tone ( I 'm old enough to remember ) , and I feel pretty sure that the masses of young white zoned-out kids are actual hippie extras , as I remember hearing about kids on the caravan to the East getting this kind of work in Bollywood . ( It is not about the actual Hare Krishna movement , though the movie hippies sing a Krishna / Rama chant , as do a group of actual Indian devotees , unrelated to the hippies , in the opening scene of the movie . ) ~ Virginia  
  Father of the pride is a pleasant surprise : It is funny , witty and features some great voice acting . The show is about the family of a Lion who is acting as the attraction of Siegfried & Roy shows . Indeed all of them are stereotypes but that 's what makes them so funny . FOTP is not a kiddie-cartoon it includes some crude adult humor but in a very mild way . It is full of popculture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed . I 'd say I 'll give the show a 7 out of ten because it is nice fairly well executed but not very original , I 've seen most of those stereotypes many times before , even in that particular order !  
  I have to point out , before you read this review , that in no way , is this a statement against Iranian people .. if you really want to read something into it , than hopefully you see , that I 'm against politicians in general .. but if you 're looking to be offended .. I can't help you ! Not in Iran as this movie is banned there ( see IMDb trivia for this movie ) . Which is a shame , because the movie is great . Would it not be for " Grbavica " , this movie would have won at the International Film Festival in Berlin . Rightfully so ( it was the runner-up , or second place if you will ) . Why ? Because it is a movie about oppression . It 's not even that this is a complete women issue . It is about the government trying to keep the people down . An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie . But by banning it nothing is resolved and / or can they make this movie disappear ! Another reviewer had a great summary line : " Comedy about a tragedy " , that sums it up pretty well !  
  Simply , one of the funiest movies i 've ever seen . It 's a parody of crime-life , parody of everything that represents the Chicago 1930 . - There is no realy need to underestimate this movie because rating is under 5 . Its a opinion of a mass , and mass is hypnotized . Who decide to watch it - it will regret , Who decide not to watch it - will regret more .  
  I 've read a few of the reviews and I 'm kinda sad that a lot of the Story seems glossed over . Its easy to do because its not a Book , its a movie and there 's only so much that can be done in a movie - US Or Canadian - or anywhere . Colm Feore does , at least for a recovering " F @ g-Hag " like myself , a great job of not only playing the ' friendly neighborhood ' gay man - but playing sick . I mean , the man really can't get much more pale ! Though , you might never know it from the strip down near the .. um , end . If you need decrepit , there are a few SKing movies you might like . Being the daughter of a Recovering Alchoholic , the druggie brother { David Cubitt } was the trick for me . I 'm going to give him cred , he grew up quick - and believe me that 's good . And , as an Aspiring writer , moimeme , I can dig a lot of his insights and overviews . But I 'm more prosy than poetic . I may be easy to please , but I enjoyed it . A nice story pretty well put together - by Canadians , quelle surprise . Just toed the line of the ' Movie of the week , ' missing it by not being as drawn out , GREATLY Appreciated . And it was rather cleverly portrayed .  
  I have found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I 'd give it a try . The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor ( Colm Feore and David Cubitt ) who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away . Ryan and Theo at first argue about who did what . But later , Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness . So , Ryan and Theo spend their time patching up their differences . This is such an incredible film . I have only seen Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24 but he was phenomenal in this . David Cubitt , an actor I have NEVER heard of before did a phenomenal job as well . I would recommend this to those who are interested in the Gay and Lesbian genre . This is one movie you don't want to miss . I give this film 10 stars out of 10 . Excellent film !  
  If you didn't enjoy this movie , either your dead , or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle . An Excellent cast , all of who gave good performances . This movie proved that Adam Sandler is good actor , despite what critics say . Adam Sandler is becoming a very well respected actor . It all started with his performance in Big Daddy , then he did a couple bad movies , then he broke through with terrific performance in 50 First Dates , The Longest Yard , then Click , and now Reign Over Me . Back to the movie . Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything . The closest thing to family he has are a mother-in-law and father-in-law . After his old college roommate ( Cheadle ) ran into him , he seems to turn his life around . I will say no more , because I do not want to ruin the movie , but I strongly recommend this movie . One of the best movies of 2007 .  
  REIGN OVER ME ( 2007 ) * Adam Sandler , Don Cheadle , Jada Pinkett-Smith , Liv Tyler , Saffron Burrows , Donald Sutherland , Robert Klein , Melinda Dillon , Mike Binder , Jonathan Banks , Rae Allen , Paula Newsome . At times affecting and at times middling dramedy about a thoroughly depressed man who lost his family on 9/11 ( Sandler in his best role since " Punch-Drunk Love " ) who winds up re-united with his old college roommate and friend ( Cheadle continuing to do impressive work with every role to date ) , a well-to-do dentist who seems to have it all  family , wealth , happiness  but really sees an ally in freedom with his troubled friend 's own personal life offerings . Written and directed by Binder ( who co-stars as Sandler 's former-best friend and acting accountant ) with equal parts humor and genuine heartache the film works best when the two stars share the screen until the last act falls into an almost movie of the week treacle with to tidy a solution to the matters at hand .  
  Dahl seems to have been under the influence of Wenders ' The American Friend . Innocent Nick Cage gets recruited for a hit . Dennis Hopper plays a real Hit Man . Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous . The Hero gets more entangled the more he tries to extricate hisself . And small town America does not seem all that safer than the Big City . Like it 's predecessor mentioned above , this movie has lots of plot twists and turns that seem improbable , but all lead to the cathartic self discovery .  
  This is a film I saw when it first came out , and which I have seen a few more times over the years . It 's always enjoyable . One thing is that the comedy does not take sides : it skewers labor and capitalists equally . Only Sid seems outside the classic struggle , even though he 's responsible for it . Spoiler warning : do not read further if you haven't seen the film This is a fantasy , though presented fairly plausibly . Ask yourself : could someone support most of his or her weight in a single strand of fabric ? It would cut through almost any support . Also , when cornered in an alley , Sid uses a garbage can cover like a knight 's shield . Cute symbolism . Someday , I 'll get this on DVD .  
  " They were always trying to get me killed , " Alec Guinness once wrote of The Man In the White Suit 's technicians . " They thought actors got in the way of things . " He went on to describe how he 'd been given a wire rope to climb down and , assured it was safe , narrowly avoided serious injury when it suddenly snapped mid-descent . " People get in the way of things " might be a maxim tailor-made for White Suit inventor Sidney Stratton ( fittingly played blank slate-fashion by Alec Guinness ) in Alexander Mackendrick 's definitive Ealing film of 1951 . Certainly , he cares only about his work , its realisation - and sod the consequences . And similarly , with the exception of a couple of peripheral characters , there 's almost nobody to root for in this chilly satire on capital and labour . Told in flashback , the film concerns Stratton 's invention of a dirt-resistant , everlasting fibre ( fashioned into the white suit of the title ) , and subsequent attempts by the clothing industry and its unions to suppress it . While the industry fears the bottom will drop out of the market , the shop floor stewards worry about finding themselves out of a job . Abduction and bribery attempts follow , with both money and an industry chief 's daughter on offer ( Daphne , the delectable , 4-packs-a-day-voiced Joan Greenwood ) , to the tragi-comic end . " What 's to become of my bit of washing when there 's no washing to do ? " bemoans Stratton 's landlady near the close . A notion Stratton hadn't even considered - and has disregarded again by the movie 's ambiguous coda . A superior , if decidedly downbeat comedy , expertly performed - and pretty much answering the oft-raised question of whatever happened to the everlasting light bulb and the car that ran on water ..  
  I enjoyed this film . But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy . It was amusing at times , but really , it wasn't very funny at all . If I 'd been expecting it to be a comedy , I might have been disappointed with the film , but , going in with no expectations , I found it to be enjoyable and engaging . Maybe it was because , as an engineer , I identified with the protagonist . I was less concerned with satire of capital or labor , and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention . A man who 's less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production . He 's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention . So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park ; me , I compare it to The Fountainhead .  
  This is the best film version of Dicken 's classic tale . I 've seen it over and over on VHS , and recently acquired the DVD version , which is formatted for TV ( not wide-screen ) . What I find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of English actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films / shows in North America since 1984 . My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward , " the Equalizer " , as the Ghost of Christmas Present .  
  I recall seeing this film on TV some years ago and not paying full attention , maybe even missing the first half , so I came to the conclusion that it was dull and over rated . I decided to revisit it last night to see if I had missed anything the first time . I certainly did . This is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and it has clearly had much influence on films today and probably will forever . I can't believe I thought this film was boring ! A young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds give the performances of their careers and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox . This story will leave you with a sense of disgust and dread long after you watch it , it is truly horrifying . Oh , and did I mention that the theme song is great , as well ? Well it is , and this movie should be seen by movie fans everywhere . Everyone should see this movie for the experience . Just don't expect a picnic .  
  After having seen Deliverance , movies like Pulp Fiction don't seem so extreme . Maybe by today 's blood and bullets standards it doesn't seem so edgy , but if you think that this was 1972 and that the movie has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differently . When I started watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until I got to the " Dueling Banjos " scene . In that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible . As I watched Drew ( Ronny Cox , Robocop ) go head to head with a seemingly retarted young boy it really shows how edgy this movies can get . When you think that the kid has a small banjo , which he could of probably made by hand , compared to Drew 's nice expensive guitar , you really figure out just how out of their territory the four men are . As the plot goes it 's very believable and never stretches past its limits . But what really distinguishes this film , about four business men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip , is that director John Boorman ( Excalibur ) breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes . So as the movie goes into full horror and suspense I really cared about all four men and what would happen to them . The acting is universally excellent . With Jon Voight ( Midnight Cowboy , Enemy of the State ) and Burt Reynolds ( Boogie Nights , Striptease ) leading the great cast . Jon Voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable . Unlike Reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start , Voight 's character transforms over the course of the movie . Ned Beatty ( Life ) is also good in an extremely hard role , come on getting raped by a hillbilly , while Ronny Cox turns in a believable performance . One thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any I had ever seen . Bill Mckinney and Herbert " Cowboy " Coward were excellent and extremely frightening as the hillbilly 's . Overall Deliverance was excellent and I suggest it to anyone , except for people with weak stomachs and kids . 10/10 . See this movie .  
  Henri Verneuil represented the commercial cinema in France from 1960-1980 . Always strong at the box-office , and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino robberies , mafia score-settling and World War II battles , Verneuil could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on Saturday night . He worked with the cream of the male actors of his day : Gabin , Belmondo , Fernandel , Delon , Sharif , Anthony Quinn . I .. comme Icare is the only time he directed Yves Montand . It 's an oddly static film , taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms , containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence . Montand gives a good performance , if somewhat dry , and he is well supported by the other actors . I couldn't help wondering what Costa-Gavras could have done with this story , on the basis of Z ( the Lambrakis assassination ) and L'aveu ( the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists ) .  
  As many people know , Mexican cinema was very poor after the so-called Golden Age of the Mexican Cinema , fortunately , during the late 90 's , and early 21st century , great movies like La Ley de Herodes , Bajo California , Amores Perros , Y Tu Mamá También and , of course , El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba , appeared . El Coronel .. , is a wonderful movie , that retells the classic story by Gabriel García Márquez , by eliminating the magic realism elements , and replacing them with the crude reality lived in Mexico , not only by people like the Colonel , who wait for their pensions , but by more than the half of the Mexican population , who live in complete poverty . The film 's characters , satirically represent classic characters found in Mexican society , such as the nationalist Colonel , the cold and even ambitious priest , the hypocrite , but at the same time loyal compadre , the tolerant and patient wife , the hidden homosexual , etc . This movie , is a must-see if you want to know more about Mexican society , and specially , if you want to watch a gorgeous movie , by one of Mexico 's finest directors  
  the government that he fought to establish to recognize his loyalty with a promised and much needed pension . Ripstein 's lyrical work is a sweet ode to all those who , like the Colonel , suffer under the abuses of a cynical and hardened society that strengthens itself by denying its citizens the means to live with dignity and purpose . Unlike the absurdity of WAITING FOR GODOT , the Colonel 's wait for the arrival of his pension gives hope and significance to his otherwise miserable life . Two things in the film drive the Colonel who is masterfully played by Fernando Lujan ; the hope that his military pension will one day arrive and the knowledge that his son , Agustin , died for a noble cause , a reason other than a drunken fracas at a rigged cockfight . Unable to realize the former , and forced to prove to the world the latter , the Colonel does the only thing he can do , set about training his son 's fighting cock . The cock is now the warrior who can bring fortune and justice to the Colonel and his asthmatic wife , but his fighting ring is that of the killer of his former owner , Agustin . In a tense scene of confrontation between the Colonel and Nogales , his son 's killer , the Colonel is offered by Nogales , a paid government agent , money enough to equal the Colonel 's full pension . But , this is blood money ; hush money designed to hide the fact that those in power have turned their backs on one who fought for their political ideals , and to conceal to the world that the warrior colonel 's son was assassinated because he wrote for an underground paper that favored the rights of labor unions and the common man . With maximum dignity , the Colonel rejects Nogales ' offer , picks up his fighting rooster and walks away as nobly as his old legs can carry him . Once he is at home , Dona Lola , his scolding wife , wants to know why the Colonel refused the money when both of them are starving . In response to her continued question , " What are we going to eat until November ( when the cockfighting season begins ) " , the Colonel responds , " Shit . " Excrement is what the poor and disenfranchised have been eating all of their lives , and excrement is a meal that the Colonel willingly chooses to eat with dignity , knowing that he could never sell his soul to those who oppress him . The Colonel waits as the only man of honor and valor in a world without principles .  
  This is the first Tom Hanks movie I have gotten the privilege of seeing in the theater , although he is my favorite . When I heard he was going to play a hit-man , I was a little stunned thinking " can Mr . Hanks pull this one off " ? And he did in high fashion . This 1930 's depression era film is a about loyalty , redemption , and one path that you don't want your children stumbling down . Tom Hanks leads a stellar cast as Michael Sullivan . Being the family man , and the secret life of the contract killer for the Oscar nominated Paul Newman . This movie Tom Hanks relies more on reaction and gaze rather than dialogue , which he delivers a knockout performance . On one night of one of his jobs , Michael 's son Michael Jr . , played by newcomer Tyler Hoechlin , witnesses the hit . And Michael Sr . ' s partner in crime , fellow stage actor Daniel Craig can't have that information out . So he wacks out the son and wife of Michael Sr . , except Michael Jr . So the two head for Chicago to get Conner Rooney ( son of Paul Newman 's Mr . Rooney ) . The drama and intense plot really thickens from their as father trys to set things right , even though son is along for the ride . While on this deadly journey , someone has hired a hit for Michael Sr . The assassin would be the photographer of the deceased Harlen Maguire , played by a stain-teethed Jude Law . The movie will have you feeling the old days . And with Thomas Newman 's beautiful and haunting Oscar nominated score to go along with it , you can't help but appreciate this film from Oscar winning director Sam Mendes . So sit back , and enjoy the wild ride .  
  Meatball Machine is an amazing splatter film , it has an original plot with young love , buckets of blood , and weird alien creatures that mutate people into freakish robotic war machines . Now the film isn't for everyone , people who love splatter films or the movie Tetsuo : the Iron Man will applaud it . The special effects can be cheesy at some points of the film , but your not exactly suppose to take the film very seriously . Yet , all in all it 's a lot of fun , well if you find budding romantics infested with slimy tumor like gobbles who seek to destroy each other in bloody alien oozing battles .  
  Maybe " Presque Rien " is not the best movie ever made .. But it is better than many of you have said . I still haven't seen a homo-themed movie better than this one . You Americans are accustomed to watch very narrative movies , with a clear beginning , development and outcome . But European movies are less narrative , but makes you think much and feel . Many of you didn't understand the sense of the movie .. The purpose of this one is not show us a simple " summer loving movie " , with commercial characters who " fall in love and live happy forever " . Summer Holidays and beach are only a background , and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys . Maybe some of you didn't understand well this movie , because of its 3 parts , showed as flashbacks . These 3 moments are : - Summertime in Pornichet , when they meet and love . - After a year and half living together in Nantes , Mathieu doesn't go to a psychiatric himself . He tries to suicide taking something , and Cedric brings him to hospital . Later , he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that . - The last part , is when Mathieu come back to Pornichet , in winter , alone .. to think about how his life have changed , how his life become to be , and trying to find himself . It 's possible that some people couldn't understand all this well , because all the scenes are mixed among them . But anyway , as I said before .. this is not a funny movie . If what someone want to see is meat , for that , we have Belami movies . Presque Rien , what want to show us , is how cruel can be the life , for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life . Mathieu only wants to go away from home , and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness .. But what seemed perfect at the beginning .. later is not as good as he thought , and he become troubled , and feel that he has lost the way of his life . He is lost and doesn't know what he really wants to do , or what makes him happy . He finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide . So , funny ? Is not a funny movie . Very hot scenes ? only a few .. but this is not a movie for entertainment . Is all about feelings .. friendship , love , happiness , unhappiness , pain , depression , loneliness .. I , as many others , feel identified with life and problems of Mathieu , and that is what director wanted to do .. a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boy 's life . For me , the best homo-themed movie ever .  
  Only after some contemplation did I decide I liked this movie . And after reading comments from all the other posters here , and thinking about it some more , I decided that I liked it tremendously . I love American films - probably because they are so narrative . They usually have a well-defined beginning , middle , and end . " Presque rien , " on the other hand , makes no such attempt . I disagree with other posters that say it 's ' too artsy . ' In every way , this film is meant to evoke your sense memories . So often throughout the film you feel like you 're there .. you feel the summer sun , the breezes , the heat , the winter chill , the companionship , the loneliness , etc . , etc . In every way , the director pulls you into the lives of the characters - which is why so many people feel so strongly that the movie disappointed them . After I finished watching it , I felt the same . But upon some reflection , I recognized that this is how the movie had to be : the ' story ' isn't the narrative , it 's the emotions you ( the viewer ) feel . The lighting , scenery , and camera angles immerse you in the scenes - they 're rich , exquisite , and alive with detail and nuance . Although I normally cannot countenance films without a fully developed plot ( after all , isn't a movie ' supposed ' to tell a story ) , this film is definitely one of my new favorites .  
  After reading the original play I thought it would have been much more difficult to adapt to screen than it turned out to be . Donal McCann puts in a once-off great performance as Public Gar , the repressed antagonist who is manifested openly on screen by his extroverted ( but unseen to others ) alterego - Private Gar . Eamonn Kelly also plays an excellent " screwballs " whose inability to communicate his feelings is matched only by Gar . Definitely worth renting out if you can find it . ( Probably unavailable outside Ireland & UK )  
  This is such a great movie to watch with young children . I 'm always looking for an excuse to watch it over & over . Gena was good , Cheech was fun , the Russian was good , Maria was adorable & of course Paulie was the best !  
  I was very surprised with this film . I was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his " marie " the little girl he was separated from . The humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do . Actually i was expecting " paulie wants a cracker " jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when paulie is in the research lab press room conference . So if you wish to see a good " animal that talks " film check this one out , much better than Dr . DOLITTLE in my opinion . PAULIE also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well .  
  I really , really enjoyed watching this movie ! At first , seeing its poster I thought it was just another easy romantic comedy .. but it is simply more than this ! I personally believe that this idea ( that I 'm sure a good part of the viewers had just before they saw the movie ) it 's yet another important part of the big concept of this movie itself ( or even of its marketing strategy ) ! What I mean is : Nowadays we are slaves to images ! To impressions ! I went to the cinema to view this film having the wrong impression , the wrong expectations , and at the end I felt how superficial I could be ! To exemplify it comes to my mind the sequence near the end in which Sidney buys the plane ticket to go back to New York and as he is asked to ' give an autograph ' , meaning to sign for the ticket , he believes that just because he got on TV thanks to the scandal at the awards he is now some kind of celebrity . And this is just , I believe , the climax of this main theme around which the movies revolves . Above this , I believe the movie also offers us a solution to get along with this , illustrated throughout the movie by Sidney 's attitude : don't become too serious about yourself or about anybody else .. " even saints were people in the beginning " .. as Sophie once says in the movie . The saints of the moment are the stars . We attribute them an ' aura ' of perfection , of eternal happiness , but the reality is much less than that . Even the saints of any religion are images , ideal models of how to behave and how to live your life . Even they were not for real .. they became ' for real ' after they died and we looked back at them . And that 's the catch : we need our saints ! we need our stars ! We strive for them as if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have anything to strive for . And television and all other media are means to create and capture our strivings . We desperately need benchmarks in regard to which to measure ourselves . And that 's how we got in the cinema to watch this movie in the first place : to see if we can fit the benchmark , or if the benchmark is to small for us . This time it was larger than we expected .  
  Weak start , solid middle , fantastic finish . That 's my impression of this film , anyway . I liked Simon Pegg in the two films I 've seen him in - Hot Fuzz , and Shaun of the Dead . His role here , though , took a completely different turn . Shows his range as an actor , but nonetheless I really disliked th character as he was portrayed at the beginning . There 's a kind of humour I call " frustration comedy . " Its supposed " jokes " and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments . Much like the Bean character Rowan Atkinmson plays . There are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters too . I don't mean to bash them here , so will not . But do be warned that if you are like me , and you dislike smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots , Pegg shows just such characteristics for the first third of this film . It DOES get better , however . I read somewhere that this is based on a true story . Hmm . Maybe . The film 's story stopped being annoying , and became kind of a triumph of the " little guy " in the final third . I don't need all films to be sugar and light - but coincidentally , as this film got better , it also started to be more and more of a happy ending . It was also a pleasure to see an old favourite , Jeff Bridges , play a role so masterfully . I liked " Iron Man , " but was saddened by the fact that Bridges ' character was a villain . Purely personal taste , of course , as his acting in that was superb . Nonetheless , he was a marvel here as the Bigger Than Life man of vision , the publisher of Sharps . It was nice to see him in a role that I could actually enjoy . Overall then , I liked it ! I just wish I had come in 40 minutes late , and missed the beginning .  
  One of director Miike Takashi 's very best . It 's so good it 's difficult to put into words . At nearly fifteen years older than the target audience it thrilled me from beginning to end . It recalls similar children 's films from the 1980s in the sense that ( unlike today ) those films weren't afraid to scare - there 's a lot of nasty detail here that I initially found jarring but soon realised it 's nothing different to what I grew up on . The film is a compilation of ' 80s kid 's films conventions . You name it , it 's there : a young boy hero thrust from his own unhappy / dysfunctional world into another , inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins ; a quest to save both worlds from an evil force ; a beautiful heroine he has a crush on ; a sadistic henchwoman ( Go-Go Yubari from Kill Bill Vol . 1 ) ; a lead villain who draws his evil power from something everyone in the world can relate to . But all these genre conventions are given a fresh spin and added depth . One of the IMDb reviews begins " Where was this film when I was a kid ? " and it 's a sentiment I agree with wholeheartedly . Even while watching it I lamented the fact that I hadn't grown up on it ; that it wasn't a part of my childhood like Labyrinth , Masters Of The Universe and , to a much lesser extent , The Neverending Story . Those films , and others like The Goonies are recalled but never copied - Miike relentlessly offering us a new take on things . Poor CGI is a staple of many of his films , sometimes due to budgetary limitations but just as frequently an artistic choice - a desire to present things in an outlandish way . Here the CGI is mostly average , solely due to budgetary limitations , but nevertheless he does a fantastic job of putting on a spectacle . The CG effects combine with traditional puppets , animatronics and truly extraordinary make-up to create a world filled with rich characters ( and characterisation ) that frequently borders on the visionary . This ranks as one of the greatest children 's films ever made . Not for younger or more sensitive kids though . Just jaw-droppingly wonderful . See it for yourselves and if you think your kids can handle / appreciate it then show it to them . Let them grow up on The Great Yokai War as some small compensation for the fact you couldn't .  
  I saw this jolly little film at age 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS . I didn't know it had been in a theater at all . To rate it from a kids point of view I 'd give it 4 out of 5 stars , because being a young boy at the time , it seemed a little " girlish " . The climactic scene where Gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time but you outgrow that sort of thing . When I re-discovered it a Blockbuster Video in 1995 , I had to revisit it ! I still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit " old " . I don't know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn't on VHS . It 's out there . Might even be on DVD by now , at least I hope it is . I want to share it with my kids someday ! 10 stars on here , it 's still a great kids film . ( end ) 09/08/2009 : Finally found a VHS copy ! Woo-hoo !  
  Billed as Takashi Miike 's " first family film " - by people who haven't seen Zebraman , presumably . YOKAI DAISENSO takes things even further in the direction of family-friendliness , diluting the darkness and cynicism to create a grand fantasy fairy tale . A young boy is chosen by fate to save the world from monsters and horrors of which they remain largely unaware . The film is evidently bigger budget than anything else Miike has done , with lots of CGI to create fantasy world populated by odd creatures ( the YOKAI ) . Perhaps the lack of extreme content is a consequence of more nervous investors , but I think it 's probably just that he wanted to do something different . He 's really never been a one-trick pony , but often gets accused of it - perhaps YOKAI is designed to silence those critics . Regardless , it 's a great project for Miike to channel his boundless imagination and invention into . There 's a very cartoonish feel to the production , evoking thoughts of Miyazaki in places . The Yokai are based on an old series of comics that were in turned based on Japanese folk tales , which certainly influenced Miyazaki as well ( particularly SPIRITED AWAY ) . It must remembered that Miike has nothing like the budget of a Harry Potter film to work with , so the special effects aren't going to be seamless Hollywood style work - some blue-screening is especially obvious . Some of the special effects are great though , with some very well animated creatures ( a mix of CG , stop-motion and puppetry ) . I think the little sock-puppet that follows the hero around for much of the film was * meant * to look really cheap , and is all the cuter for it : ) The young lad who plays the hero of the film does a really good job - it 's so hard to find a pre-teen who actually understands the concept of acting , but 9 year old Ryunosuke Kamiki is a genuine talent ( I see he did voices in the last 2 Miyazaki films ! ) . Chiaki Kuriyama is delicious as the villainess of the piece , though Mai Takahashi made an even greater impression as the pixie-eared River Princess - yum yum ! Those looking for another violent , perverted gangster film aren't going to find what they 're looking for in YOKAI , but if you 're a fan of Miike because of his imagination and wit , there 's plenty to satisfy here . And it has the added bonus that you can happily put it on whatever company you 've got : )  
  For starters I have always been a fan of the Batman cartoons because the theme is so universal , ' that everyone alive has an alter-ego ' . This is true in the Mystery of Batwoman . While the overall story is good I 'm disappointed that they haven't really done much for the franchise with this . Throughout the movie , you are trying to find out who the identity of Batwoman is , unfortunately you can find out by easily looking at the cast of credits posted on this website ( so if you haven't seen it already don't go there ) . I was sort of disappointed that they didn't make the movie longer . 75 minutes is way too short for any movie . The secret identity of batwoman also comes far too early in the movie , sort of midway , and becomes anti-climatic afterward because you know the good guys will always win and that the new character known as Batwoman will disappear after the movie is over . I 'm also not too sure about the new animation style used in this movie . I love the sleek new characters but there should be some more detail where detail is called for . Some parts of the animation look so awkward and rigid that it grabs your attention right away diverting your attention away from the storyline . I also didn't really like the bright atmosphere used in most of the scenes , it sort of loses its dark and gothic feel which is Batman . Similarly we should 've gotten to know more about batwoman 's personality so that we can build the same deep compassionate feeling that we do with Bruce Wayne . Also I think the fight with Bane should have been done better . In typical children 's fashion the bad guy meets his demise too easily either by tripping , falling , getting electricuted or doing something dumb that works against them . Come to think of it there wasn't even one drop of blood spilled in this movie either . Bottom line , its a good entertaining flick and I recommend anyone who 's a Batman fan to watch it . It has good storyline , universal appeal and even great acting to top it off . I just wish that they could have delivered more permanent change to the story by making Batwoman stay to make things more interesting . Not just introduce her and then kick her off once she 's done . I 'd also like to see someone else figure out the mystery for a change finally . To have some other than Batman solve the mystery and fill him in later with the details . I hope there are more animated movies to come and look forward to the time when we will actually be able to see the breakup between Bruce Wayne and Barbra Gordan . He 's been stringing her along forever and doesn't even like her and I can't believe that she was dumb enough to fall in love with someone 20 years older . I also want to see the time when Tim Drake leaves because he is getting sick of the old man . In short I want to see all of the things that led the characters to where they will be in Batman Beyond . Otherwise the same repeated formula will just end it faster than if they just decided to move on with the story .  
  Randolph Scott is heading into Albuquerque to take a job with his uncle . However , on the way there , the stage is held up-even though they are not carrying a strongbox . However , a nice lady on board is concealing $ 10,000 for her and her brother 's business .. and the robbers seem to know this . Once in town , Scott goes to this uncle about the job . However , he soon learns that this uncle is a jerk-the typical bad guy from Westerns . You know , the rich guy who only wants to become richer by cheating and stealing and threatening until he owns everything . And , it just so happens that this jerk was behind the robbery . Scott demands that the uncle returns the money and then Scott goes into business with the nice lady and her brother . Not surprisingly , this is NOT the end of the problems-just the beginning . Again and again , intrigues of various types occur to try to crush the uncle 's opposition . One trick is to bring in a pretty lady to befriend Scott and his partners . She 's a crack shot and it looks bad for Scott-until he figures out why she 's come to town . Unlike most later Randolph Scott films , this one shows Scott as a bit more headstrong man . All too often in his films he 's the last one to suggest violence , but in this film he 's quick to suggest a lynching ( screw the law , let 's have a hangin ' ) and later he 's quick to threaten the uncle . What a surprise to see him as such a hot-head-though in most other ways , he 's the same old Scott you 'd expect . As far as the film goes , there 's nothing particularly unusual about it . Gabby Hayes plays the usual character , Scott is a hero , the baddie cannot be reasoned with and ultimately is destroyed and Scott gets the girl . Despite this very typical plot , it 's all handled very well and as a result is well worth your time . By the way , there are two weird scenes in the film . First , late in the movie , there is a fist fight between Scott and the uncle 's # 1 henchman , Lon Chaney , Jr .. In it , Chaney smokes as he fights-something I never saw before and I did admire how he could puff away as he got his butt kicked . Second , get a load of that runaway cart scene with the whip-now THAT was one impossible feat !  
  Off the blocks let me just say that I am a huge zombie fan so I don't make statements like the above lightly . Secondly let me say that this is an Italian zombie film and Fulci only directed 15 minutes of it before handing over to Bruno ( Rats , Night Of Terror ) Mattei . This is no Dawn of the Dead folks . That said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films I have ever seen . The script is wonderfully horrible . Just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote ( " Let 's try putting these two molecules together " ) . The zombies come in all varieties . From moaning shufflers , to machete wielding maniacs , to birds ! The gore is plentiful . Legs are bitten off , arms amputated , stomachs burst open . The pace is fast , flying from one zombie attack to the next . Then there 's the head in the fridge . Oh the head in the fridge ! One of the greatest moments in horror since Ash got his hand possessed in Evil Dead 2 . You should know already whether you 're the sort of person who 's going to like this sort of film . Get some mates and some beer and you 'll be in for a fun night . Did I mention the head in the fridge ? ! ? ! ?  
  I can't stand it when people go see a movie when they know they won't like it . My mom likes violent movies , so why did she see it ? She rated it just to bring down the rating . So I know that 's why it didn't have a higher rating . I give it a 6/10  
  I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed this most thoughtfully delivered drama , which owing to its rather unimpressive 6.6 rating , I nearly missed ; as I rarely give the time of day to any movie rated below 7/10 . Having said that , I 'm so glad I gave Stone Angel the viewing it so very much deserved . And so should you , if you are one of the increasingly rare sensitive , soulful and thoughtful sorts of person left on this earth in living form . I must say that in many ways ( though not all ) , viz . its themes , execution , style , production etc . , Stone Angel very much reminded me of the much praised " The Notebook " . I am so surprised that other commentators didn't pick up on the many similarities which repeatedly struck me throughout this movie , so I can only assume that those who 've written comments have yet to see the Notebook . They may not share any Alzheimer 's theme , yet I can confidently say that if you very much enjoyed " The Notebook " you will certainly find much to engage your time most fruitfully with " The Stone Angel " . But even If you 've not seen The Notebook , nor read the book on which this move is based , ( which , incidentally , I haven't either ) you should definitely find much to hold your attention firmly - as long as your favourite genres don't include fast paced action thrillers . This is a movie for thinkers and those who like to reminisce about time 's passing , how life changes as the years pass , and what might have happened in one 's life as one gazes back through the years . This bizarrely underrated yet great movie really deserves a rating of approximately 8/10 . I can only blame its current lowish rating of 6.6/10 on the 11 % of idiots who gave it 1/10 . After all it has attracted less than 300 votes at the time of my writing this comment . Nonetheless , if those 11 % who gave it the lowest ranking possible were really expecting car chases and explosions why didn't they look .. for even a few seconds at the movie 's premise and promotional lines ? Oh dear .. Whatever the world is coming to , don't miss this most underrated gem of a movie - but only * if * you have a brain ( i . e . , your top ten doesn't include Transformers , Fight Club nor The Terminator ) .  
  What I loved about the on-screen adaptation of The Stone Angel is that it stayed so true to the novel ! Great film ! As an avid reader , I find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation . You can tell the Stone Angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film . Ellen Burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of Hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar . However , I think the Canadian actress ( Christine Horne ) chosen to play Hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that warrants great praise . I haven't seen any of Horne 's previous work but I will definitely seek it out after seeing her Stone Angel performance . I heard the Canadian theatrical release of The Stone Angel is going to happen in Spring or Summer 2008 . I can't wait to see it on the big screen again !  
  A Christmas Together actually came before my time , but I 've been raised on John Denver and the songs from this special were always my family 's Christmas music . For years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was Christmas . A few years ago , I was finally able to track down a video of it on Ebay , so after listening to all the music for some 21 years , I got to see John and the Muppets in action for myself . If you ever get the chance , it 's a lot of fun-great music , heart-warming and cheesy . It 's also interesting to see the 70 's versions of the Muppets and compare them to their newer versions today . I believe Denver actually took some heat for doing a show like this-I guess normally performers don't compromise their images by doing sing-a-longs with the Muppets , but I 'm glad he did . Even if you can't track down the video , the soundtrack is worth it too . It has some Muppified traditional favorites , but also some original Denver tunes as well .  
  Last weekend I bought this ' zombie movie ' from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of " Land of the Dead " . Boy , was I wrong . It seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover-art , which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genre . We watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell-phone . They actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him ; but once they started driving the car , I couldn't suspend my disbelief anymore . Some people actually consider this a " so bad , it 's good " movie , they are liars . I didn't finish the movie , but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie , which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through . This is even worse than " Zombiez " DO NOT WATCH !  
  he was my hero for all time until he went along with { if you can call it a movie } I went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero 's acting and the hole thing was .. I can't believe that Steven Segal 's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors . I watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does . When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong . The plot is unbelievable as a movie , and even if you excuse the visuals , and had read this story as a novel , you 'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book . Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation . He shows no effort and no enthusiasm , and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all . I hate to repeat other peoples comments , but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic . The condition of those scenes chopped in , is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time . The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner . My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie , it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds . I read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget ( Segal being paid 5 of that ) and that the movie still came in under budget . I must concur . It is no wonder that this is a direct to DVD movie , as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie .  
  Nobody could like this movie for its merit but , if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their MST3 quality , then this is for you . It ranks up there with " Road House " for its preposterous characters , sets and story line . The bad writing really cracked me up : " I want you to dust those guys off " instead of " . . . dust those guys . " F-14s take off from the carrier but , when they get into formation , they 're F-16s ! Without a hint of anger or skepticism , Segal goes back to work for the general who , only minutes before , was overseeing a covert " mind wipe " on Seagal . Segal runs out of bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards . So naturally , the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too ! The hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway . The little stealth fighter can fly all the way from California to Afganistan without refueling . Then Segal flies it back to California - the long way , i . e . , by way of Europe - even though there 's a carrier giving him air support 20 minutes away in the Arabian Sea . The CIC in the carrier consists of 3 black PCs , 2 flat screen TVs and pictures of gauges and maps on the walls . What a hoot !  
  Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be in this film , and be forced to play a part-Mexican or he would have been suspended . Believe me , he made the wrong choice ! Presumably , after the success of " Dodge City " , Warners tried a follow-up with Errol Flynn and his usual list of buddies , like Alan Hale , Guinn ( Big Boy ) Williams , Frank Mc Hugh and the ever-present John Litel , but they made the huge mistake of trying to present Miriam Hopkins as a love interest for Flynn v . Randolph Scott , and as a singer to really make things bad , because she proved one thing , and that is she cannot sing . The story was not too bad , but with Bogie clearly miscast also , it turned out to be a poor Western that was overlong , and on a low budget , but in fairness , color would not have helped .  
  If he wanted to be accurate , he should have chosen some Frisco natives and not a bunch of NY actors who know nothing about the Sucka Free ( not Sucker Free ) . I 've lived in SF my entire life , and folks here do not talk or act the way these actors did . Everything was over-dramatized , and the only cat I saw from the Bay was JT the Bigga Figga with his little cameo as a rapper . No shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats out here ( ie his Warriors jersey ) . Not once did I notice anyone wearing any Giants or 9ers gear ; instead he fitted them in some cheesy made-up SF or Oakland jerseys that aren't even sold around here . HP has no bowling alleys , black and Asian gangbangers do NOT wear head or wristbands with the colors of Africa or China 's Olympic team , nor does every Chinese gangster wear a Yao Ming jersey and try and sound black while shooting hoops . Further , while there now is a significant yuppie community that has invaded the Mission , all that was shown was some white dude and a self-proclaimed " 100 % West Coast Boriqua . " This is NOT New York ! Puerto Ricans here are few and far between , and the Latinos in the Mission are very , very different from the ONE that was shown here , who was without a doubt from NY . Also , HP is not the only black neighborhood in the City . An accurate depiction would have shown the drama between HP sets in their own hood as well as vs . Fillmore , Sunnydale , Lakeview , etc . This film could 've been much better if Lee had done some more homework and had a better storyline to work with .  
  Murder By Numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made-for-TV but isn't . Considering the only actor of any note is Bullock ( although Michael Pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things ) , it isn't a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things . Like .. remembering to lock your front door when you go out . Or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower . Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather , a cop with personal issues ( don't they all ) . Together with her new partner ( a wet-looking Ben Chaplin ) , she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman . Nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they 've planned and executed the perfect murder . As the investigation continues , a battle of wills emerges between Cassie and the main suspect Richie Haywood ( Ryan Gosling ) . The crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless . Bullock , though she is very nice to look at , is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as Rodney Dangerfield ( actually , he 'd be better ! ) . Chaplin , for his sins , is a complete non-entity and I feel sorry that he has to put this film on his CV in his attempt to break into Hollywood . At least Gosling and Pitt , as the conniving sneering suspects , acquit themselves adequately . As if dodgy leads weren't bad enough , a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable ( but illogical ) ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run . " Murder By Numbers " has absolutely nothing going for it , even a pointless nude scene by Bullock wouldn't redeem it . Well , just a little but still not enough to save it . Forgettable , predictable and redundant - this is one film that isn't going to move the cop genre forward . As Cassie probably says on her next case , there 's nothing to see here people . Move along , keep moving ..  
  A lot of people seemed to have liked the film , so I feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review . But after sitting through 96 minutes of it , I feel I have to do so . Where the heck is the plot in this film ? ! I must have missed it , I was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened . Sure the ending was " somewhat shocking " but they didn't build up to it . I forgot who was who half of the time , so they didn't really develop the characters . The acting was so-so , most of the time it was believable , but I was able to see through it most of the time . So .. without giving anything away , I must say that unless you like the actors in the film , there is no real reason to watch this movie . I could be mistaken , but I just didn't understand why there was so little , or too much of the film . I can't decide which one that would be , so I say judge for yourselves . I don't even know if renting it would be a good idea , the cost and all .. Plot : 0/10 Characters : 1/10 Acting : 2/10 Overall : 3/10 I feel like that 's too high really , I am staying with my vote up at the top .  
  When it comes to horror movies , I am more than willing to suspend disbelief , ignore sub-par production values , and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare . This movies simply has no good scares to offer . It can't even be enjoyed as camp . Bad dialogue , bad acting , bad direction , the kills were predictable and poorly staged , the music was annoying , the camera work was wretched , even the costumes were bad . I felt really bad for the actors , who were obviously trying , but who had to deal with terrible , contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction . I doubt they got any rehearsal , either . It 's embarrassing to watch , and so boring than making it through to the contrived " surprise " ending requires tremendous endurance . It 's quite easily one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . I don't normally write reviews , but this one was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others . This movie is a complete waste of time . If you must watch this movie , don't miss the " Making of " - featurette . The writer / director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold , daring move . ( Seen it . ) He and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it 's a new-age " Citizen Kane . " It 's like listening to a group of third-graders take you behind the scenes of their Christmas pageant . They truly think they 've created something of substance . It 's sad , really The only reason I gave this movie a " 2 " is because I think " 1 " should be reserved for true atrocities , like " Manos : Hands of Fate " and " Space Mutiny . " So " American Nightmare " isn't the WORST movie I 've ever seen , but I 'd have to say that it 's somewhere in the bottom fifty .  
  This series just gets worse and worse . Poorly written and just plain not funny ! The premise is excellent , but the writer 's inexperience shines through . By trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone . Now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about , and resorted to that patronizing , smug , " Oh , silly you " style acting that comes with a no laugh script . They roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say , aren't we zany ? Isn't this funny ? Well , no , it 's not actually . Gum disease is less painful . No wonder , with the exception of Corner Gas , Canadians generally avoid Canadian TV . Come on CBC you 're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of Canadian talent . Pull the plug on this amateurish mess .  
  Saw this film ran in the wee hours on TCM . Several problems with the film were apparent from what I saw . First , the adults did not age when the children did for 10 years . Several parts of the film had continuity problems & for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the 10 years passed . The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes or so , at least a huge gap with black screen appeared . It is too bad , because even though the script left something to be desired , Bergman & Russell both did fine in the film in their roles . It is a shame the large chunk is missing , but what is here is watchable . I just wish it was all intact . The script makes little sense in that Bergman 's character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults ? Some of the time lines don't make sense either . There is a stock market crash that resembles 1929 but the kids grow up to fight in World War 1 . All the acting by the support folks in this film is fine . Just wonder what was in the 20 gap of film I could not see as it was missing .  
  At the beginning of the film , you might double-check the DVD cover and re-read the synopsis a couple of times , but no worries . It 's NOT " Memoirs of a Geisha " that you purchased ; just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be . Still , the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie , as it shows how in the year 1840 a Samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery . He decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara-kiri ( ritual suicide through disembowelment ) . Cut to present day , when the American Ambassador in Japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago . From then onwards , this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional . Let 's start with the good aspects , namely the original Japanese setting and the presence of the delicious Susan George who is my all-time favorite British horror wench ( well , together with Britt Eckland , Linda Hayden and Ingrid Pitt ) . The bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent , imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter . The restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff . The spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into Susan 's ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress ! In this " possessed " state , she even lures the American ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests . So , strictly spoken , it 's not really " evil " that dwells in the house ; just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long-dead hands ! Obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening , especially since the light-blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in " Ghostbusters " . " The House Where Evil Dwells " is probably the least scary ghost movie ever . Throughout most of the running time , you 'll be wondering whether director Kevin Connor ( who nevertheless made the excellent horror films " Motel Hell " and " From Beyond the Grave " ) intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over-the-top , like " Motel Hell " maybe . But then again , everyone in the cast continues to speak his / her lines with a straight and sincere face , so I guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed . " The House Where Evil Dwells " is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn't even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning . I am fully aware of how shallow it sounds , but the two scenes in which Susan George goes topless are the only true highlights . Well , those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over-sized spiders ( or are they crabs ? ) in the daughter 's bedroom . How totally random and irrelevant was that ? If you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation , make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep . Trivia note for horror buffs : keep an eye open for the demon-mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant Japanese horror classic Onibaba .  
  Director Kevin Connor and wannabe action-hero / romantic lead Doug McClure , re-team in this ghost story set in Japan . They had been moderately successful together in the 1970 's , with the likes of ' The Land that Time Forgot ' ( 1975 ) , ' At the Earth 's Core ' ( 1976 ) etc . Without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though , the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way . The film begins with a prologue set in the 19th Century , with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide . A move forward to the present introduces married couple Ted & Laura , visiting Japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place . No surprises as to what happens next , with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend Alex ( McClure ) assuming the role of the wife 's lover . Everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant , to an inevitable ( but surprisingly downbeat ) conclusion . Main points of interest are two feeble decapitations ( ' The Omen ' has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set-piece ) , and the love-making scenes featuring the doe-eyed but extremely kinky Susan George . The first is a long ' Don't Look Now ' inspired piece with her hubby , complete with piano music ; the second a much shorter ( probably at her insistence ) entanglement with McClure , both looking pretty uncomfortable . Anyway , every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost . Overall I can't decide whether ' The House where Evil Dwells ' is rubbish , watchable rubbish , or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way . If you 're not into the genre there is nothing here at all , but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort . BEST SCENE - in any other film the big , black , tree-climbing , Japanese-muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show . They are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene , where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup . On seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is ( ! ) , to be told beef and vegetable , before uttering the immortal line " Ugh - there 's an awful face in my soup " . If this wasn't enough the reply is " C'mon , eat your soup for Daddy . " Laurel & Hardy rest in piece .  
  Quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom . A group of top quality actors , in the main well cast ( with a couple of notable exceptions ) , who give pretty good performances . Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley as Diana . All do well with the scripts they were given . So much for the good . The average would include the sets . Nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book , although bizarrely the house they use for the Dower House looks remarkably like it . It is clear then that the Dower House is far too big . In the later parts , the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the UK , presumably to save money , although with a little imagination I have no doubt they could have recreated Ceylon . Now to the bad . The screenplay . This is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it . Edward does not die in the battle of Britain but survives , blinded . He makes a brief appearance then commits suicide - why ? Loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with Gus to a sensible farmer 's wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear ( less emotional than Brief Encounter ) . Gus , a man besotted and passionately in love , is prepared to give up his love without complaint . Walter ( Mudge in the book ) turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man . Jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't speak . Aunt Biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification . The Dower House is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess who has a fear of armed soldiers . Whilst Miss Mortimer 's breasts are utterly delightful , I could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward . The delightfully named Nettlebed becomes the mundane Dobson . The word limit prevents me from continuing the list . There is a sequel ( which I lost all interest in watching after this nonsense ) and I wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story . It is difficult to image that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book ; presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased .  
  Without wishing to be a killjoy , Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichéd films i 've ever seen - this being one of them , and Camp Blood being another . The acting is terrible , the print is shoddy , and everything about this film screams " seriously , you could do better yourself " . Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap ? I bought this for £1 , but remember , you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life . You 'd do well to avoid this turkey , even at a bargain basement price .  
  Enough is enough .. sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead . The first Tremors movie was great . The second one was ridiculous . The third one was nauseating . The tv series was depressingly awful . And this movie just drives the stake deeper . Basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry , now we have the series set in the Wild West , in the 1800 's , and they fight graboids . Like a rehash of the first one , they have to learn how to beat them all over again . Mildly entertaining I suppose . Otherwise this straight-to-video release , just like Tremors 2 and 3 , is just going way too far . Oh and I continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place .. did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event ? I think something like this would be history-making , so our pals in the first film wouldn't be so unprepared . Movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy . Avoid this garbage .  
  I found Tremors 4 : The Legend Begins , to be dull and boring . All the action scenes were stupid . The so called " GRABOIDS " are reduced to the size of a modern day house cat , if not smaller . The acting was horrendous , and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the Tremor saga , because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed , the story is so dumb and useless . Also , if you want to tell a story WAY back in time , make sure you use the SAME ACTOR ( Michael Gross ) , to be someone in the past , when he 's someone in the present in the other Tremor movies . Geez .. If you haven't seen this film , don't waste your time . Stick to Tremors , 1 , 2 , and 3 , for a good time . This film however , make sure you 're remote is sitting right next to you with the STOP button working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense .  
  How many more of those fake " slice of life " movies need to be made ? Hopefully not too many . Raising Victor Vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by the director Peter Solett at garnering the attention of Hollywood . Nothing wrong with that in general . What is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every cliché in the book of supposedly " edgy " Hollywood independent production . It 's supposed to be " real " so left shake the camera " documentary style " , except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose .. It 's " edgy " so let 's not waste any time lighting the film . It 's " hip " , so let 's have the children use swear words like Al Pacino in Scarface .. And so on , and so forth . All that you are left with is a very self-conscious attempt at impressing Hollywood that won't impress anyone outside of the " rarefied " indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film .  
  I hate this movie . It is a horrid movie . Sean Young 's character is completely unsympathetic . Her performance is wooden at best . The storyline is completely predictable , and completely uninteresting . I would never recommend this film to anyone . It is one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to see .  
  B movie at best . Sound effects are pretty good . Lame concept , decent execution . I suppose it 's a rental . " You put some Olive Oil in your mouth to save you from de poison , den you cut de bite and suck out de poisen . You gonna be OK Tommy . " " You stay by the airphone , when Agent Harris calls you get me ! " " Give me a fire extinguisher . " " Weapons - we need weapons . Where 's the silverware ? All we have is this . Sporks ! ? " Dr Price is the snake expert . Local ERs can handle the occasional snakebite . Alert every ER in the tri-city area .  
  This movie is not based on the bible . It completely leaves Christ out of the movie . They do not show the rapture or the second coming of Christ . Let alone talk about it . It does not quote from scriptures . The end times are called the great tribulation . The movie does not even show bad times . The seven bowls , seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a 15 second news cast of the sea changing it 's structure . The anti-Christ was killed 3 1/2 years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended . The only part they got correct was there was two prophets . The did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures . The worst part of it was I really wanted it to be a good movie . I wanted to take unsaved people to it . I feel that the movie is evil . It is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does . I just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books . The second problem with the movie is it was just bad . Bad acting , bad special effects , bad plot and poor character development . I have seen better episodes of Miami vice .  
  En route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track ( but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway ) , a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination . The strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area : in the first story , an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman 's husband , but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie ; and in the second story , a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on . The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea , but with only two stories , it falls woefully short . And that 's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver : the acting is lousy ( with Joe Haggerty , as the tale-telling Ebenezer Jackson , giving one of the strangest performances I have ever seen ) ; the locations are uninspired ; the script is dreary ; there 's a sex scene with zero nudity ; and the ending .. well , that beggars belief . To be fair , some of Sykes ' creative camera-work is effective ( although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused ) and Joe Castro 's cheapo gore is enthusiastic : an ear is bitten off , eyeballs are plucked out , a face is removed , brains are squished , and there is a messy decapitation . These positives just about make the film bearable , but be warned , The Zombie Chronicles ain't a stroll in the park , even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash . I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10 , but generously raise my rating to 3 since I didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3D ( although I have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference ) .  
  The movie has several story lines that follow several different characters . The different story lines don't feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times . It may sound weak and cliché but it 's true ; You 're way better of watching the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery channel with Steve and Terri Irwin . It 's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is . I 'm sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn't give us the viewers much pleasure . For a comedy it simply isn't funny enough and Steve and Terri Irwin just aren't good actors , not even when they play themselves ! Their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene 's feel long , distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times . The movie had quite some potential , I mean Steve Irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch , so when I first heard that they were making a movie about ' the crocodile hunter ' my first reaction was ; brilliant ! The movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters . The movie does has a certain entertainment value , at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still , I must certainly wouldn't recommend this movie . Watching this movie felt like a waste of time . Still this movie might be watchable just once , when it gets on TV , on a rainy afternoon . It does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential . 4/10  
  I picked this one up because the music was done by Hans Zimmer , a customer of Metasonix modular synths ( made by someone dear to me ) . The jacket art says " the 2003 version " . I give it one point for a strong female , one point for cheezy dialog and one last point for meg foster 's light blue eyes , of which there are plenty of shots of . It was fun seeing David MacCullum casually swimming ( the pool has a plexiglass viewing window ! ) , while his lady love was being chased by a psycho in Greece . The sets were marginally impressive-that is , rich people 's houses in L.A. and Mendanassos ( sp ? ) , where the castle was . I found myself wondering how they were able to keep up the cleaning with all the dust blowing around . The wind wasn't fierce enough to be believable to me . I kept thinking that the animal pelts on the furniture must be nasty .. etc . and realized that the film must be pretty boring if i am wondering these things when the supposed plot was unfolding . I stumbled over things like why did she light a fire , blow out the match , then throw the match into the fire ? ! Dumb stuff like that . It was clunky at best . Oh well . Robert Morely got to have a bit of fun with his kooky geezer character and a nice vacation out of it .  
  Madison is not too bad-if you like simplistic , non-offensive , " family-friendly " fare and , more importantly , if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplane racing . If , like me , you grew up with the sport and your heroes had names like Musson , Muncey , Cantrell , Slovak , etc . , prepare to be disappointed . Professional film critics have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sports cliché in the book . I needn't repeat what they 've said . What I felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the " glory years " ( which many would argue were already past in 1971 ) . Yes , it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring down the course six abreast , though it was clear that the restored versions ( hats off to the volunteers at the Hydroplane and Race Boat Museum ) were being nursed through the scenes at reduced speed . But where was the sound ? Much of the thrill of the old hydros was the mind-numbing roar of six Allison or Rolls-Merlin aircraft engines , wound up to RPM 's never imagined by their designers , hitting the starting line right in front of you . You didn't hear it , you FELT it . Real hydro buffs know exactly what I 'm talking about . There 's none of that in Madison . Instead , every racing scene is buried under what is supposed to be a " heroic " musical score . And then there are the close-up shots of the drivers , riding smoothly and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines , in some cases taking time to smile evilly as they contemplate how best to thwart the poor home-town hero . Or , in one particularly ridiculous shot , taking time to spot Jake Lloyd giving a " Rocky " salute from a bridge pier . In reality , some unlimited drivers wore flak vests to minimize the beating they took as the boats slammed across the rock-hard water at speeds above 150 mph . As one reviewer so aptly put it , " The sport deserves better than this . " Finally , since another user brought up anachronisms , I 'll add one : the establishing shot of Seattle shows the Kingdome and Safeco Field . Neither existed in 1971  
  Detective Russell Logan ( Lou Diamond Phillips ) has a major problem on his hands . The serial killer , Patrick Channing ( Jeff Kober ) , for whom psychic extraordinaire Tess ( Tracy Griffith ) helped him capture , has been resurrected with The First Power ( .. given to him by Satan after his execution in the gas chamber ) and can possess the bodies of the weak . Somehow , Russell , who joins forces with Tess ( .. who has an understanding of what they are up against ) , will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die at his bloody hands . They will seek help from Sister Marguerite ( Elizabeth Arlen ) who has tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic church of The First Power , but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop Channing .. a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of Channing ridding the world of his evil . She 'll take it anyway and lend a helping hand to Russell , who 'll need all the help he can get when Channing kidnaps Tess preparing her for some sort of Satanic ritual / ceremony . In the film , Mykelti Williamson , always a reliable welcome supporting actor , gets the partner of Russell role .. so you know what will happen to him . As in films of this type , everyone around Russell is dying , but when he attempts to kill Channing , he 's merely murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses . Pure occult rubbish .. stupid from the gate to the finish line . Phillips and Griffith try , I 'll give them that , but in a flick like this they don't stand a chance . Kober , who is normally often always effective as the heavy , is really handed nothing more than a goofy villain who leaps in the air and tosses rotten quips .  
  The real shame of " The Gathering " is not in the bad acting , nor is it in the despicably shallow plot . The real shame is that it was far worse than the series it begun , even though it did have one main attraction : Takashima . I would love to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova , even for just five minutes . She has that sarcasm , that wit , that double-edged personality that is at once volatile and lovable . Sadly , though , the " Babylon 5 " pilot movie has an incredibly dull story involving assassination . Patricia Tallman - who never seriously returned to the series until much later - fortunately got much better with age as Lyta Alexander , who here is little more than a whiny , tiresome telepath . I shall leave you with one final thought - why is it that Delenn looks like some sort of outer-space frog man ( even though she is a woman ) ? Thank heavens for the way the Minbari looked later in the show .  
  I 'm sorry , I had high hopes for this movie . Unfortunately , it was too long , too thin and too weak to hold my attention . When I realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream , I felt cheated . Surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper , something more meaningful . So , don't buy a large drink or you 'll be running to the rest room . My kids didn't enjoy it either . Ah well .  
  Terrible acting by Potter and a flat plot with no tension what so ever . And as for the feminist polemic , it 's laughable . I saw this garbage when it was first released and though I found it tedious beyond belief I 'm glad I did go to see it . That 's because I now have an immediate answer to the question ' what 's the worst film you 've ever seen ? ' Plus , I have the comfort of knowing that every film I see for the rest of my life will be better than The Tango Lesson . But I have to admit I was impressed with the way Potter wrote a script that would garner the maximum number of arts council grants from around the world ( as is revealed in the closing credits ) . I only very recently saw Orlando and I can see how Potter learnt the wrong lessons from making that film . All it took was a bunch of frilly costumes , a few hard stares to camera by the leading lady , and a loose plot to seduce the cinema going public . So why shouldn't she think she could get away with the self-indulgent nothingness that is The Tango Lesson ?  
  I won't add to the plot reviews , it 's not very good . Very improbable orphanage on Bala . Cushing and Lee at their height . Some nice scenery . Good for face spotting , and I quote , " look at the mouth , that is Cassie from Fools and Horses " . Otherwise , a poor example of the British film industry . Fulton MacKay was far better in Fraggle Rock , Keith Barron was better in anything else and Diana Dors did what she did best . Redeeming feature ? It was free to watch on the Horror channel prior to its going over to subscription . I won't be subscribing on this effort .  
  this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any REAL evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example Bart Sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldn't there be two or more shadows for each object when Apollo 11 went through the van Allan radiation belts they spent 30 Min 's there not the 90 Min 's claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray . seriously do some research learn what really happened don't let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened  
  From it 's uninspiring title to the flat acting performances , Curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout . The film has gained some fans by way of the fact that Quentin Tarantino 's name is attached to it , and the silly and out of place nod to the Rodriguez / Tarantino flick ' From Dusk till Dawn ' . These things do not make a great movie , however , and this is more than evident all the way through ' Curdled ' . The film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas , and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing . The Mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool , but it 's becomes annoying very quickly ; especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is Mexican , it doesn't fit with the tone of the movie . The film 's plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who , because of her obsession with grisly murders , takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes . It sounds boring and it is . William Baldwin is the only ' name ' on the cast list , and even he doesn't make an impression . He hasn't been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing , he 's pretty much wasted . Angela Jones , or rather ; the taxi driver from Pulp Fiction , takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman , and it is always clear that it 's her involvement with Pulp Fiction that won her this role , not her acting ability . She may have been good enough in her small role in Tarantino 's masterpiece , but she doesn't have the talent to lead a film by herself . She looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film , and if it weren't for her Latino accent ; she wouldn't convince the audience that she 's a weirdo on any level . Curdled is a one hundred percent-proof piece of forgettable trash . Films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics ; but this one fails on all levels . Whether you 're a Tarantino fan , William Baldwin fan , horror fan or just a movie buff ; this is one to miss .  
  This movie was a mess . It had the absolute worst editing I have ever seen . It was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial , and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream . Under the messy direction and editing , there was a glimmer of something good . A good idea , a compelling spark . But somewhere it went wrong . The story is about a quasi-psychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders . The first thing that is hard to bite into is Richard Grieco as a priest . Well the part doesn't call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well . The second problem is Dennis Hopper as the crazy bad guy . He always plays the crazy bad guy . Very ho hum . Oh , a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy , horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character ( Grieco ) was experiencing . And just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords . Not a good sign for any movie .  
  I found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored . How can people possibly give this a 10 ? It 's not just that it 's supposed to be a feel-good redemption film ( I think ) , because it doesn't work on that level either . Weak plot , bad dialogue , terrible acting ; there 's just nothing there . Harvey Keitel is decent , but has nothing to work with , and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are just terrible . The plot progression ( especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley ) makes no sense . It seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it , without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow . It 's only an hour and a half , but that 's 90 minutes of your life you 'll never get back .  
  Might contain possible spoilers ( Not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter ) Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion ? Sure it 's cheaper for them , but after a while , wouldn't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off . House Of Villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all . Some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are : The voices don't even remotely match up and Iago is evil again ( Since when ? ! ) I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney films . Even the movie 's musical number ( which had been Disney 's specialty for years ) stunk . I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone even the very young . All I can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released , it 's only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses Disney in overall quality .  
  Did anyone who was making this movie , particularly the director , spare a thought for the logic of the story-line ? These are not mere plot-holes , but plot graves , that become ever deeper as we lose any sympathy for the main character and his plight . That is , if you are kind enough a viewer to valiantly ignore the fact for most of the movie that the characters are either servants to the grave-hole plot , or boring and unlikeable . Or , in the case of Downey 's & Hannah 's characters , apparently superfluous . In pondering the reason for existence of Downey 's character 's significant screen-time in the movie , I decided that either the director had liked his character and unnecessarily increased his screen-time ( unlikley , as the director didn't change anything else about the script he actually needed to ) or that his character was going to be sacrificed on the altar of bad plotting . I 'll leave you to guess which one it was to be . I had to keep checking the cover of the DVD to confirm that this really was made by credible talents . I cannot understand why Robert Altman would take this job . Surely he has some power to pick and chose . Actually , I can't understand why anyone would take this script on , except a first-time director looking for the experience . I suppose Robert Downey Jr . needed the money for his habit . I suppose Kenneth Branagh wanted to try a southern accent . I suppose Robert Duvall was only given a few pages of the script and thought the role in isolation sounded intriguing . These are the only motivations I can see that would coerce good actors to take on roles in this movie . As for Robert Altman , plenty of effort has gone in on his part to making the movie look fantastic . I found myself noticing how he had framed such and such a scene , or used the bright orange float vests in another scene to draw the eye 's movements , or imposed a beautiful filter to create a particular mood . I do not typically notice such things in movies , since most movies I bother to watch to the end actually engage me for reasons of good story-telling and interesting characters with understandable motives . I watched this to the end only because some ridiculous element of optimism in myself kept looking at that DVD cover and being convinced that , due to the talent involved , there had to be some redeeming factor in this movie . Nice direction . But that 's not why I watch movies .  
  This film is so much of a rip-off of the masterpeice " demons " and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching . The acting is terrible , the action scenes are speeded up , the script is almost painful and budget non existent . If you think this film is good then you havn't seen a real horror film , skip this and get a copy of the movie demons .  
  This is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be . I dread to think what the Blockbuster-approved edit must have looked like , because the director 's cut on DVD was a bore of the epic proportions . Naturally , you don't expect it to be " The Godfather " , but an acting class or two might have come in handy . Also , there were so many cute guys in this movie , but they were woefully under-exploited . I like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their BVDs as much as the next guy , but even I have a right to expect a little more . It wasn't a total loss , though ; at least we got a peek a Drew Fuller 's ( covered ) junk and truly upsetting haircut . And there 's Huntley Ritter looking even cuter than he did in " Bring It On " ( and acting about as well ) . There 's always a silver lining , kids . You just have to look really hard for it . And occasionally , you have to make use of your pause button .  
  Marvin ( Rob Schneider ) does not have the ingredients to be a cop which is his lifelong dream . But his luck changes when he has a car crush ( a very bad one ) and is found by a doctor . The doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild him . After this moment , he starts to have wild behaviours unconsciously and becomes a best cop one could ever be . By the time , he realises the changes and his animal instincts starts to take over his human side . In the mean time , he finds a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman that means he has to control himself and behave civilised . I am not a big fun of Rob Schneider . In fact , this is the his first film I have seen . However , I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser . ( See his part in Ally Mcbeal , quite funny actually ) . There are some good parts in the movie such as his flirting with the goat . In such movies , the biggest problem is that the script is seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent . I am sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it is not taken too seriously . But very sad to see such films doing very good in the box office . The Animal is not the worst film I have seen to date but fails to get more than * .  
  This movie was the beatliest mormon movie made yet . It made the RM & Sons of Provo look like well done films ! It was supposed to be funny from what I was told . The best part was the best actor in the movie-Travis Eberhard-if he wasn't in the movie it probably wouldn't have been made ! He ruled ! 10 . It wasn't funny 9 . It was beat 8 . It had Thurl Big T Bailey , who 's character made no sense 7 . It was made in Provo 6 . It didn't make fun of Brokeback 5 . It had Larry H . Miller in it 4 . It was the 1st movie Clint Howard wasn't funny in 3 . Gary Coleman chose the perfect movie 4 a comeback 2 . They should have cast at Surreal Life auditions 1 . It was made by Halestorm Entertainment !  
  WOW what can i say . I like shity movies and i go out of my way to watch a corny action flick , but Snake Eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance . Lorenzo Lamas , pfft more like Lorenzo Lameass this guy has as much acting ability as Bill Clinton has self control . It has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse . Crazed Hillbilles YEP ! needless tit shot ( with a real weird scar ) YEP ! crappy soundtrack YEP ! I wish i could give the movie - 10 stars but 1 is as low as it goes . Seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real .. the worse thing THERE IS 2MORE SNAKE EATER MOVIES ! .. guess its in demand .  
  I 'm a fan of the series and have read all 7 books . I wanted to see this just to see how it was done . All i can say , is that the only people who should watch this are ones who have already read the series and are curious about it . Its pretty bad , and will turn you off reading them . Not to be mean , but Lucy is so ugly it detracts from the movie . Was she the directors daughter ? Seriously , I 'm sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth . She had an overbite that would put any beaver to shame . The movie just loses so much in translation . CS books don't translate as easily as the Tolkein LOTR books , or even Harry Potter . One thing they did right ! Aslan ! very well done . Although the other human actors with painted faces ( beavers , wolf ) look silly , Aslan was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around . ( i guess its like that old horse custume ? 2 people inside ? ) Also , i would be curious what kids think of this movie . Maybe they would enjoy it ? But as for adults , safe bet they wont , even if a CS fan .  
  Perhaps I 'm out of date or just don't know what Electra is like in current publications .. But the Electra that I read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan . She usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved . Just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way . This movie was fairly weak on the dialog , the acting wasn't particularly convincing , and the action was spotty . I was really looking for something more along the lines of Frank Miller 's book " Electra Assassin . " Which is much darker than anything in this movie . Special effect where cool , action was interesting at times , but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical . Tha Hand was not menacing enough , and Electra was not .. bitchy enough . She 's the girl you love to hate .. but in this story , I just didn't care either way .  
  Imagine the worst skits from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in one 90 minute movie . Now , imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity . Now imagine something 50 times worse . Got that ? Ok , now go see The Underground Comedy Movie . That vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever . UCM is the single worst movie I 've ever seen . There were a few cheap laughs .. very few . But it was lame . Even if the intent of the movie was to be lame , it was too lame to be funny . The only reason I 'm not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else I know bought it . He wasted his money . Vince Offer hasn't written or directed anything else and it 's not surprise why .  
  I saw this film first in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee . But then , in Poland in 2000 , I watched it in a complete form . And so what ? The plot is incredibly unwise - 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong , straight and fundamentally severe ladies . The men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichés follow - sex-drive , constant masculine desire for sex , feminists who are shown like complete idiots ( you may agree with them or not , but idiots certainly they are not ) , and so on . The performance even of the stellar Jerzy Stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like " I am in the elevator with a nude chick and I haven't done anything to her ! " . This was intended to be a comedy , instead , it turned out to be a vapid farce , full of predictable jokes and below-the-waist innuendos . Do not waste your time on it - this is just bad .  
  Anyone who visited drive-ins in the 1950s , 60s , and 70s , must have seen a film or two by American International Pictures , a distributor that resembled 1980s giant Cannon Films . Wherever movie-goers ventured , AIP would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles - in the 50s came horror movies like ' Voodoo Woman ' and ' The Undead ; ' in the 60s were Frankie Avalon-Annette Funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like ' The Glory Stompers ; ' and into the 70s , AIP churned out grindhouse-level trash like ' Cannibal Girls ' and ' Sugar Hill . ' ' Dillinger , ' released in 1973 , is one of the more ' highbrow ' AIP efforts that capture the true spirit of drive-in film-making ; it is one of those uneven , over-the-top flicks that satisfied the masses ' thirst for entertainment , craftsmanship and common sense be damned . On the whole , ' Dillinger ' is typical for its era : entertaining and worth a couple of hours , but certainly not memorable . Heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact , ' Dillinger ' was a fair effort by screenwriter-director John Milius ( ' Magnum Force ' ) but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career . The 109-minute ' Dillinger ' - epic for AIP 's scope - follows the quest of FBI Midwest chief Melvin Purvis , played by Academy Award winner Ben Johnson . Purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four FBI agents killed in a 1933 Kansas City ambush that helped gangster Frank Nash to escape justice . At large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout , including expert bankrobber John Dillinger ( Warren Oates ) , Pretty Boy Floyd ( Steve Kanaly ) , and psychopath Baby Face Nelson ( Richard Dreyfuss ) . Dillinger eventually joined forces with Floyd and Nelson , taking along Homer Van Meter ( Harry Dean Stanton ) and Harry Pierpont ( Geoffrey Lewis ) . He also hooked up with Billie Frechette ( Michelle Phillips ) , a prostitute of French and Indian extraction . While taking place over several months in 1933-4 , ' Dillinger ' is basically a chase film , with Purvis 's entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by J . Edgar Hoover . ' Dillinger ' has a documentary feel , listing dates and places while Johnson supplies loose narrative as Purvis . Milius keeps an honest Depression look , using authentic fashion , cars , weapons , and buildings ; he also sprinkles around black-and-white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts . The film is never boring , moving at a quick , if haphazard , pace . The action scenes are Dillinger 's strongpoint , edited competently by Fred Feitshans Jr in his last professional effort . Thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film , not to mention pounds of explosives . This film is certainly not for the squeamish , with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place . The violence , while gratuitous , brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on American life . This film never transcends its exploitation status , however , because the needed writing just isn't there . John Milius , somewhat overrated as a filmmaker , places way too much emphasis on action . The action scenes ( mostly blood-filled shootouts ) are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era , including 1967 's ' Bonnie and Clyde . ' But we simply don't get to know much about Dillinger and his gang members as people ; the vital relationship that develops between Dillinger and Frechette is barely touched upon , with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward . Melvin Purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline , becoming a prominent figure only when Milius needs to keep the film from unraveling . All too often , the film takes on a shoot-'em-up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail . Aside from this , the picture 's main crime is ignorance of historical fact . While many say that ' Dillinger ' is just a film , it 's films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent . Those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that John Dillinger was not the last of his ring to die , as Milius 's screenplay and the film 's documentary style encourage us to believe . In fact , Dillinger died before Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter ; he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death , nor did he have Billie Frechette in tow . While these inaccuracies might make for high drama , there is no reason why Milius couldn't have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them . Warren Oates 's performance as Dillinger is quite good , although he sometimes looks unconvincing . Oates is humorous and nicely portrays how Dillinger became consumed by his larger-than-life image in the American press ; however , we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime . Ben Johnson gives some life to Purvis , suave but rather flat . Michelle Phillips brings emotion to the Billie Frechette character and it 's really too bad that Milius 's screenplay didn't flesh out her relationship with Dillinger . We never learn what drew her to a cold-blooded killer , other than the stereotype of an easy-going girl who is attracted to men of danger . The supporting roles with Kanaly , Dreyfuss , Stanton , Lewis , and a briefly-appearing Cloris Leachman , are acceptable for such talent . As a piece of 1970s exploitation , ' Dillinger ' appears doomed to retail bargain bins , which is exactly where I picked up MGM 's DVD release for $ 4.99 . The film is nicely presented in widescreen ( a must for drive-in flicks ) with subtitles in French and Spanish . Dillinger 's theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra . Largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive-in enthusiasts , the film doesn't really call for much else in way of supplementary material . For fans of the genre , it 's certainly worth checking out . * out of 4 Roving Reviewer - ww . geocities . com / paul_johnr  
  Saw in on TV late last night . Yeah , I can hear what y'all say about this one . It IS likely to be categorized as one of those stereo - typical TV soap series . In all fairness , the story line does have a fine twist to it , and you might nod saying , " Well , that 's not what I expected . " But , as a film , well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element . Casting , acting , camera work , cars , costume , setting , script , no , there 's nothing to congratulate . Rated R ? Oh , that scene . Did we need it ? This is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched . And what was the title again ?  
  I was never so bored in my life . Hours of pretentious , self-obsessed heroin-addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems . It 's like watching lizards molt . Even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy . If you have insomnia , rent this .  
  This is a very cheaply made werewolf flick . The video is dark and poorly lit . The audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed . The script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun ! [ filled of course with silver bullets ] . The acting is as wooden as the characters . The FX are non-existent , lots of extreme close-ups of werewolf jaws and biting . the only thing that is shown is lots of soft-core T & A . Instead of dropping $ 30 for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic : " Dog Soldiers " with Sean Pertwee .  
  Why bother seeing this movie , if you have great movies to see . It is a total waste of time and money . The movie is so bad that I felt bad for wanting to watching it . Everything in it is BAD . Actors were bad . Script was REALLY bad . The story is stupid . And the worst CGI EVER . The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club . One interesting thing that , there is a characther that we wish that he dies because , he is so stupid that we get enough of him . ( I don't remember the name but was the BOYFRIEND of the " Chosen One " . ) NOTE : If you want to see a good movie , this movie isn't the right choice . 0-Stars out of 10  
  Hip . Erotic . Wickedly sexy .. whatever . It 's " The Terminator " with werewolves . No , seriously . The cop saves the girl ( waitress ! ) from the big monster and refers to himself as her ' protector ' . The lead actor Ryan Alosio does a pretty good job of emulating Kyle Reese .. there 's a massacre in a police precinct .. the bad guy is muscular with red eyes .. and it even contains dialogue along the lines of " You said it yourself , he won't ever stop . Never . " The dire script comes from a first-time screenwriter who , thank God , hasn't sold anything since this , and it 's all thrown together by famously bad director Richard Friedman . The movie opens in a strip bar ( always a good sign ) , and a mean-looking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason , pursued by three cops . One of them is black , and ( shock horror ! ) he 's the one who gets killed in the first five minutes . The film goes downhill for the next hour or so , then picks up a little with some decent action sequences , before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending . For the most part , the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who 's willing to settle for less . If nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and Alosio , along with some of the supporting cast , shows signs of talent . DarkWolf in his human form is played by gargantuan Kane Hodder - famous for his numerous portrayals of Jason Vorhees in the ' Friday the 13th ' movies . He 's decent enough , especially considering he isn't used to speaking roles . It 's become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams , who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former ' Power Rangers ' actresses . And it 's unnervingly clear that the editor spent WAY too much time on that scene .. anyway , the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good , and the design of the wolf isn't bad at all . But the CGI is bad . Just plain bad . I mean seriously , if you can't reach some level of realism - why bother ? Just throw a little extra money into the make-up ! Aside from the terrible script , this movie does have it 's moments , many of which are unintentionally funny . It 's good for a laugh if you don't have anything better to do , but just don't spend any money on it . Please .  
  I don't know what this movie is about , really . It 's like a student 's art school project . They never say why the world is dark , but it is always darkness except for seconds a day . There are long , interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason . What little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images . A black woman enters the main character 's apartment . Somehow she becomes pregnant overnight , then gets shot in the head . The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges . I have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be . Honestly , I would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it 's about . But I wouldn't wish this level of hell on anybody else .  
  " People I Know " is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about - despite the game efforts of a talented cast . Pacino delivers his usual tour de force as Eli Wurman , a past-his-prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption . But unlike Michael Corleone , it 's impossible to have an emotional investment in this character , his dilemma , or his fate . The film traces Eli 's preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause , while distracted by a client 's ( Ryan O'Neal , good in an underwritten part ) latest " dirty laundry " - in this case , a TV actress companion who 's gotten involved with the wrong people . Tea Leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role , although again , the script doesn't give her much to work with . As Eli 's sister-in-law , Kim Basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics . This movie is strictly for those who like watching Pacino strut his stuff , and enjoy the other principals . Unfortunately , between the script and direction , " People I Know " is strictly amateurish . Hence its limited theatrical release , and speedy journey to DVD . Consider yourself warned .  
  OK , I didn't have high expectations but this film descending into depths I could not imagine . The plot , as it were , involved a priest of an obscure 2 member order investigating the death of the founder of the order by a Sin Eater . The Sin Eater allows for Catholics to achive salvation outside the authority of the Church and is yet another immortal in film with loads of ennui . Nevermind that this makes no sense since then a Baptist could give you salvation .. we 'll move on . I 'll layout the plot w / o giving much away : the priest goes to Rome with his buddy to investogate . He brings with him a mental patient ( I 'm not making this up ) who shot him during an excorism and who loves him ( not one lick of this BTW is explained ) , a drunk Irish priest and Peter Weller as a Cardinal . They get to Rome , find some creepy kids who do nothing in the film , meet with a bondage gear S & M anti-pope that the drunk Irish guy knows ( not explained ) and who gives information by killing people ( oh , BTW , he 's a bad guy so he has an industrial / techno soundtrack ) and then .. umm , seriously , I 'm not sure . the plot meanders about . Heath chills with the Sin Eater , flies to New York with the Sin Eater for an overnighter and then some other stuff happens and then ( all off camera ) the anti-pope falls and the film ends . About 1 hour into the film one really wonder if anything has happened . By the end something has happened but you can't be at all certain that it matters and since most of the drama takes place either before the movei or off-scren you 're really feeling cheated .  
  This is a truly abysmal ` LOCK STOCK ' clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script . I have no idea why so many top British actors signed up to this junk , they must have been bribed . A miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if I hadn't have paid good money for it I 'd have turned it off after 10 minutes . Not the worst film ive ever seen , that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a movie ' ( I use the term loosely ) ` GUMMO ' ( I feel like suing that so called ` director ' for the lost hour and a half of my life ) but this trash is nearly right down there with it . Definitely one of the worst 5 films I have ever seen . Stuff like this reminds Hollywood that they don't have a monopoly on truly awful films .  
  I shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad . That has been done in great detail already , many times over . The ' plot ' started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide-boy / gangster-by-numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles . Anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves . It is now 7 or 8 years since I watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled , yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film I have ever seen . I am only making these comments , and indeed the only reason I went to see the film , is because of the amusing fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second ' heavy ' in the pub scene . It was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards Rhys Ifan 's face in the bar in ' Russia ' ( it was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island ) . My brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever - he had recently joined an extras ' agency and this was his first part . Having seen the film , it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever . I remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and this was just a couple of days after it had been released . I have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast - and rightly so . In case you were thinking of renting this film on DVD , I would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red-hot , then jam them into your eye sockets . This will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film .  
  In recent times I have been subjected to both this movie and " King Arthur " , on DVDs chosen by others for an evening 's " entertainment " and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion I have that the modern movie-watching public totally lacks discrimination , and is content as long as they get " action " . Both movies were utter rubbish . Whatever happened to character development ? Whatever happened to meaningful dialogue ? Whatever happened to ACTING ? And , when watching something that vaguely purports to be " historical " , whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy , some realistic idea of the " political map " of the time , even some slight flavour of the era , especially in its social attitudes . Why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century America ? I have read on the message boards of disclaimers that " little was known " of the dark ages . Not so . Considerable amounts are known , with much learned scholarship on the era , but these jokers simply couldn't be bothered to do any homework . I only wish I could vote 0/10  
  This movie is probably the worst I have seen . Bad acting , bad script , bad everything . Comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting . Both Cyborg ( Van Damme , 1989 ) and Nemesis ( Olivier Gruner , 1993 ) are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it 's Albert Pyun who has directed these two as well ! The story is not original . The world has become a terrible place , possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war , and people live under medieval circumstances . A special breed of robots ( cyborgs ) live on human blood and there 's the story .. The cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there " prophecy " and the humans need someone to stop them . One girl together with a robot ( Kris Kristofferson ) built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind . In this movie the director tries some Hong-Kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far . The movie fails miserably in this attempt . I recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new " worst ever " movie to relate to . And to fans of the genre I recommend " Cyborg " since I think it 's a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor . And if you can't stand Van Damme then check out " Nemesis " . I rated this movie 1/10 .  
  This movie will promote the improvement of the mind . Read a book ! It 's incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make . I 've seen " B " movies before but the " C " movie has just been invented . I didn't think I would ever enjoy Power Rangers since my kids stopped watching but I found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into " Knights . " High school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume . Embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind . My roommate , who loves these types of movies even turned it off . Now that has to really tell you something . If you watch this movie , and like it , I will pray for you .  
  Okay , so , someone , somewhere , a few years ago , thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies stowing away aboard the Apollo 11 and going to the moon . So they did . Someone , somewhere , was an idiot . I want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware . As far as I can tell , the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on . The graphics in general were pretty good - the rocket launch gave me chills , like a good rocket launch always does ( my Popular Mechanics flying-car gearhead blood still runs strong ) and the 3D was pretty effective . The CG wasn't Pixar-quality , but it was generally good . The flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics , with some half-assed late-60s characters thrown in for colour ( hippie flies , African-American flies with giant afros and black shades , etc . ) and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads ( although they made suitably gross squelching noises ) . The scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework , relying on offensive and outdated clichés ( 60s gender politics including mostly-useless female characters , racial stereotypes , evil Russians , a fat fly who only wants to eat , grade-two level gross-out humour ) . In a movie aimed for IMAX , they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel - they didn't get their physics right ( zero-g in the Lunar Module during landing burn ? PLEASE . ) They couldn't even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between Houston and the astronauts , all of which is in the public domain ; instead they wrote their own dialogue , which sounds like crap . But we liked the maggots . So they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots . Uh , yay . 1.5/5 .  
  It is pretty surreal what these flies can do .. eh well .. this is a cartoon , so anything can happen in it . At first I must tell you that I love animated movies . Unfortunately this year 's repertoire is very weak . This cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws : 1 ) I quoted the tag line . It suggests that this movie has great 3D effects . Well , I did not see any , at least not something special I never saw before . 2 ) The " flies " in this movie look nothing like real flies . At least they could 've make them black . But cyan flies , seriously ? With giant heads and slim torsos ? 3 ) The story . I guess it was written for 6 year old kids . I could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified . 4 ) Excessive patriotism . For example : " They are American files after all ! " Oh , give me a break .  
  When I first saw a small scene of it in some announcements , I thought the show would be entertaining to watch . The little robot guy does look kinda cute . The style of animation does look sort of familiar to some classic shows . Before the show aired , I studied it through some sources . There , I did became slightly dismayed . The three children ( Tommy , Gus and Lola ) are voiced appropriately but Robotboy is an exception . It would have been a lot nicer if he were to be portrayed by a young lad . One good example is Robot Jones , a robot character from " Whatever Happened To Robot Jones ? " The show isn't bad really . But the way Robotboy is inappropriately portrayed is my only criticism . Thus , I don't watch it much .  
  Anyone notice that Tommy only has 3 facial expressions . 1 . The angry eyes look he gives every enemy . 2 . The holding of the hands to face , mouth agape and frightened eyes . 3 . The smiling Tommy Turnbull . I have to say that i pretty much hate this show , i don't watch it but it 's like Code Lyoko , we 've all watched at least one , i must say that this show is borderline racist , uninteresting and pointless . every episode ends with robotboy winning , except for one exception when robotboy basically let this overly geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpack . The jokes are pretty crude too , i think it 's mostly people saying the word " Suck " or farting , i think the bullies of the show are quite shocking too . Isn't there one that hides a bowling ball under his hate , and the other uses a chain , for god sake , what kind of school is he going to . Not to mention his older brother , who is borderline psychopathic and has no other character qualities . The whole show i feel is ripping off megas XLR and Fosters . Like you could say the trio of coop , jamie and Kiva , as well as Robotboy being similar to Megas where he beats everyone no matter what the odds and he 's free spirited despite being a robot . There is simply no appeal to this show , i 'm surprised that it 's still running .  
  If you like films that ramble with little plot exposition spiced with kinky sex , this film is for you . On the plus side the lead actor / actress ( newcomer transsexual ) does have an interesting screen presence , but not enough to add up to much more than a mildly interesting movie - if that . Essentially this film is about 3 social outcasts ( transexual prostitute , male hustler , and Russian , gay immigrant ) who somehow have developed a bond . Why is not clear . We are expected to accept these misfits are at the core basic honest people who have the ability to love while they hustle their bodies on the street . Right ! And Anna Nicole Smith was truly in love with her ninety something sugar daddy ! The filmmaker shows a gritty , unpleasant side of life while wanting us to believe underneath it all these seriously damaged people are really quite normal to the extent they have a menage a trois which helps them through life . Quite a fantasy , but unfortunately portrayed here as real look of life on the wild side . In sum , no plot , no truth and no real reason to spend much time here . Unless of course you just like to revel in the kink !  
  For years I remember reading about this show " Trouble With Tracy " in the TV Guide . CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 am ! I lived about a two-hour drive north of Toronto and we couldn't get CFTO , but you know how it is - we always want what we can't have . Well , I knew what I wanted and what I wanted was to see what this " Trouble With Tracy " was all about . Did it have a beautiful girl in the starring role ? Was there nudity ? Was there suspense ? Was it a comedy ? It would 've been fine if there was some promotion of the show . At least I could 've known what I was missing . But , NO ! The mystery drove me bonkers , until CTV affiliate CKCO built a re-transmitter in Wiarton , Ontario and began to broadcast " Trouble With Tracy " at the same time as CFTO .. Saturday mornings at 6 am ! One Saturday morning I got up and turned the TV on at 5:59 and at last I got to see what " The Trouble With Tracy " was . Yes , the " Trouble With Tracy " was that it was Canadian content and stuck in the harmless 6 am spot so no one would ever see how awful it was . Talented Canadian Actor Steve Weston died a few years afterward , but many would argue he effectively " died " the first time he appeared on this show . When I saw it for the first time that cold Saturday morning and fell despondent back into my bed , part of me died , too .  
  Otherwise it is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen - and I mean ever . My wife and I were both bored out of our minds within 10 minutes . Not to mention being boring , it is entirely unbelievable . Women ( non-lesbian ) don't bathe together - nor do they " accidentally " kiss . Brothers and sisters don't live together well into their 30s and run around swing dancing together and engaging in footraces in central park . Men don't find out their wife and sister romantically kissed the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with said wife . Absolutely ridiculous . Heather Graham is possibly the worst actress in films today . She smiles when she should be crying and vice versa . The only movie she has ever been good in is Boogie Nights - and that is because she wasn't acting . I cannot stress enough how bad this movie was .  
  SNL is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a Short skit on SNL is a little dumb minded . It 's NOTHING like SNL , it 's just a stupid piece of crap . Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder but fails . Although Jon Heder is only funny in Napoleon Dynamite Andy tries his hardest and people think he 's funny . Only funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader . The only part that was decently funny with Andy was the pool part . They could have made the " Quiet place " a lot better if they didn't make the falling scene 3 freaking minutes . The part where he 's pronouncing his H 's more is retarded . They try going with it too long and half the time it looks like Andy is laughing while he acts .. he 's a horrible actor and doesn't deserve to be in a movie . This movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10 year old level of comedy . Which is about half the United States .  
  This relic of a short film starts with a teen going through the process of attempting to get a driver 's license . It quickly becomes sidetracked with just about every imaginable topic relating to cars . Such things as dune buggies , drag racing , custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed . It often attempts to be humorous but instead the film is dull , drawn out and even sexist at times . None of the people in the film are actually heard . Instead , everything is done in narration and voiceovers . Sorry , but I can't stand that . There is nothing educational or interesting about " Dad , Can I Borrow The Car ? " . It 's just another piece of mindless filler to take up time on their " Wonderful World Of Disney " TV show . 1/10  
  This warning against anti-semitism is well-meant and may have had its purpose at the time , but it is made without the slightest notion of how to make a film . The director has no idea about mise-en-scene ; the cast varies from bad till even worse . The great Austrian comic Hans Moser is wasted . In his part he ends in an asylum for the crazy , that is designed as a set from Das Kabinett des Dr . Caligari ; one wonders whether the makers had all their mental capabilities . The restored copy I saw ( Dutch Filmmuseum ) gives the impression that some scenes were not put into the right place , but may be the original editing was bad as well .  
  Whatever possessed Guy Ritchie to remake Wertmuller 's film is incomprehensible . This new film is a mess . There was one other person in the audience when I saw it , and she left about an hour into it . ( I hope she demanded a refund . ) The only reason I stayed through to the end was because I 've never walked out of a movie . But I sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that Madonna and Ritchie could actually think they made a good film . The dialogue is laughable , the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery . Ritchie took Lina 's movie and turned it into another " Blue Lagoon . " This is a film that you wouldn't even waste time watching late night on Cinemax . Time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this .  
  * SOILER * It 's fake ! The whole thing is a fake ! There is no ghosts or zombies , Alan is a Lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants the castle and his title for himself . So he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala SCOOBY-DOO to drive Alan to commit suicide . Most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them . He 's not even killing them . He drops off to sleep and the girl vanishes and he thinks he buried them someplace . If he looked at the so-called ghost of Evelyn , he could tell she was wearing gloves ! My God what a waste of time . Don't bother watching it , renting and if you bought it and haven't watched it yet , sell it . Quickly ! Do yourself a favor and stay away from THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE . I give this stinker the CRAP-O-LANTERN .  
  This British pot-boiler has one thing going for it : the young men are uniformly good looking . The older men are opinionated , right-wing Thatcherites whose behavior brings back all the acrimony of the Reagan / Thatcher years . Young or old , however , morals in this three-part mini-series are universally suspect and no one comes off particularly well . Nick is a handsome young gay man fresh out of Oxford . It is not pivotal to the story , but he has an extraordinarily beautiful head of hair which makes watching this drivel much easier . Nick comes to London with a friend , whose father Gerald is a rich conservative politician , and babysits his sister Cat while the family frolics in the south of France . They neglect to inform him that , when upset , Cat cuts herself with an assortment of knives and other kitchen implements . Nick mistakes their self-serving ' gratitude ' for affection and moves in , finding out too late just how much they despise and patronize him . Inexplicably , Nick lives in this house for four years but , as the plot depends on this point , it 's best not to question it . While Nick is most pleasing to look at , he is unbearably obsequious . His coy subjection to rich bigots soon had me climbing the walls . Deeply closeted except to Cat ( she guesses his big secret on sight ) , he does like a little anonymous sex just so we know he is actually gay . Though it hardly seems possible , Nick takes a lover who is even more closeted than he . Supercilious Tories scorn and insult the two blacks in the film , so imagine the venom which spews forth when Nick 's sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid . Gerald , in true Tory fashion , has become involved in several personal and financial scandals , so the revelations about Nick add to his embarrassment . This gives Gerald one final opportunity to roundly castigate the hapless boy . Except for one brief moment of indignation , Nick takes the abuse heaped upon him in silence and tacit agreement . Denial , self-loathing , naiveté , or ignorance ? You decide , if you can manage to sit through this whole thing without throwing something at the set .  
  The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino , the screenwriters try to be Tennessee Williams , Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway , the late James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles , Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman , Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye Dunaway ( older version ) , Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can ( successfully ) , don't ask about Joanna Going . Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff . It delivers endless , meaningless dialog and very little action . Tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies , an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a lovely , sprawling mansion by Frank Lloyd Wright . Visit Tulsa , don't watch this movie . It doesn't do the location justice .  
  This is a review of ' Freddy Mercury The Untold Story , ' theatrical release , Chicago Int . Film Festival , 2007 One of the phoniest , uninspired and most tedious biographical documentaries I have seen . If the film I saw in a movie theater was originally released on TV , I would plead with its producers and distributors to not fool a paying audience with the false promise of a cinematically worthy documentary feature . Even as a made-for-TV documentary , the sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and the pompous , pseudo-literary narration rang more true of a sleepapedic bed Infomercial . The only redeeming aspects of this " The Untold Story of Freddy Mercury " - or , uhm , was it " The Untold Story of Princess Diana " are the original concert , video and TV footage - unabridged Freddy Mercury and Queen . Testimonial interviews with irrelevant eye witnesses with insights , such as : " He was a free spirit , " ( really .. I thought Freddy Mercury was a company man .. ) belittle those Freddy testimonials , by Brian May or Montserrat Caballe that shed new and affectionate light into Mercury 's complex life and character . And .. what up with the Harry Potter-like boarding school segments ? How did the interview with the first girl-crush ( " .. who now works in a travel agency " ) and members of Freddy 's first school band contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury ? Vital milestones of his personal life , his sexuality , his artistic style and growth , Queen , the band remain unexplored . These filmmakers don't ask a single , provocative question , nor do they engage in independent or visionary research of their subject , instead delivering a tedious montage of politely clean and vastly empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend , who doesn't deserve to be remembered by this History Channel biography your grandparents can doze off to on a Sunday night .  
  Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films , for there is not much of a plot , bad acting , pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes . But . And this is a big but , there is one good actor , one good recurring joke , and a good beginning . The good actor being Tim Curry , the one good recurring joke is the creepy , weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things . And the good beginning is the spoof of the Excorsist . The plot to Scary Movie 2 is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion , but will they survive the night ? This film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it !  
  This was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isn't that great . Sure , " CHAOS " and " INSIDE MAN " are literally the same movie , just with variations in suspense . But I found " CHAOS " more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film " Swordfish . " The reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the States and " Chaos " was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters , but has yet to find a distributor in the U.K. and U.S.A. It 's true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films , but that doesn't mean that it is a pleasant film to watch . Watch it if nothing else is on T.V. , but you 'll probably get bored with after awhile .  
  Just another example of why Stepehn King 's books should not be made into movies . ( Even Carrie , one of the best , is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen . ) The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer , always on a diet , who " accidentally " kills an old gypsy woman . In court , with the help of the judge and the local police chief , he gets off , even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving . The father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3 , with our main character , Billy ( the lawyer ) getting thinner and thinner by the day . Though the movie kept with the book , for the most part , and has your typical King ending , the acting was stilted and felt forced . We went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between , sort of like reading acts in a play . King himself made a cameo in the movie ( sort of like Dave Barry ) , which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that : authors . Leave the acting to actors . Not that anyone in this movie was that great . I 've seen the major characters in movies where they were much better .  
  I read in the papers that W.Snipes was broke so no wonder he would take parts in low budget projects like The Contractor . He is just the next action star to join a growing club : the penniless action stars of the 90s ( Van Damme , Segal , Lundgren , Snipes ) . Here he stars the lead in a cheap action flick which was shot in Bulgaria ( we are supposed to believe that the location is London , like only a complete moron would buy that ) The story is the one of 1000 other movies : retired special forces good guy gets hired by the government again to do a wet job - after that government wants to get rid of him - good guy gets away after killing bad guys ( was that a spoiler ? guess not ! ) The star of the movie : the little girl ( Eliza Bennett ) outperforms everybody else of the cast ! One star is for her plus one star for eye candy Lena Headey , makes 2 stars . Only for die hard Snipes fans ! Everybody else : avoid !  
  Don't really know where to start with one of the worst films I have had the displeasure to watch in a very long time . From the setting which was quite obviously and very clear to anyone who has visited London for even 1 day will agree .. was not London . To the much unexplained way how Snipe 's character managed to escape the country back to the US without a single problem . Then he convinces the girl and grandmother to visit him in America , how on earth did Grandma agree to that .. he 's an assassin ! Well that 's the ending how about during the film , well unfortunately that didn't fare much better . We have British cops driving an amazing range of cars , I 'm sure it was an eighties Vauxhall Belmont which chased the taxi after the assignation , but a modern Subaru Imprezza escorting the prison van in a few scenes prior . SO19 or whoever the gun toting arm of the Met they were trying to portray was happily running around the streets with their guns out chasing after Snipe 's along with the CIA . There were children walking around , but the police were still stating they had a clear shot to shoot him , does this happen in London ? No it doesn't , I live there . We also have the very implausible travel from central London to the airport ( let 's say Heathrow for arguments sake ) within 5 minutes of receiving a call . We also have terrible American accents , a young girl who 's posher than the Queen , but lives in Elephant & Castle . What does it say for British police when helicopters and a number of officers at Snipe 's location can't find Snipe 's and he manages to evade capture by hiding behind some stairs ? The train station was obviously not even on UK soil and the fight scene sound effects were terrible . The plot was also extremely poor , boring and been written and filmed a lot better a thousand times before . But there were a few notable actors cast in this film , what were they thinking and please don't let that sway you to watch this film ! This film didn't seem to know what it wanted to be , if you are going to concentrate on the dramatic aspects from the aftermath of an assignation then you need a strong rigid plot with plausible scenery and setting , this is something the viewer has time to take in and appreciate and if you do it wrong then you notice it . If you want an all out action film ( which this is not ) then continuity and scenery can be put to the side .  
  the IMDb guidelines state that you have to declare if your comments contain ' spoilers ' . well , this whole film is something of a spoiler .. a cautionary tale that glorifies what it cautions against , a tale of lost youth that doesn't know where it itself is going . i just saw this at the tribeca film festival . this film wasn't just bad , it was really bad . the acting is inconsistent , the characters are the mostly cliché offerings with little depth , and farnsworth 's acting was very bad in particular . from the patronizing accents to the pointless plot line to the out of place ' graphic ' elements to the repetitious dialog and scenarios .. it sucked the big one . i think he was looking for sort of a more edgy , updated ' drugstore cowboy ' with a touch of ' natural born killers ' but it is no where as sensitive to the characters as the former and no where as shocking ( outside of some frat-level gore ) as the ladder . more than anything , someone needed to really A ) edit the screenplay ( there are some things in there to build on and clearly deals with a worthy subject .. if ham-handed in it 's attempt . ) B ) edit the film . if it was cut down to a core , it might be passable . i would go lower than 1 if i could .. like maybe zero kelvin .  
  After finally viewing this movie in its entirety , I am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike . Is it the worst Western ever ? No , I wouldn't say that . But " the last great American Western " , a phrase I saw applied to it more than once ? Not even close . A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue , and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that I 've ever seen . The movie can be measured in groaners per minute ; as in , how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life ? There 's so many instances of this that it 's distracting . Cheesy lines come at you in waves ; predictable , unoriginal , and often . If bad dialogue doesn't bother you , then how about bad gunfights ? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that 's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously . It 's okay if there 's a comic edge to such gunfighting , such as in Silverado , but in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good Westerns . The final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score , but by then , I was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving . Other than those flaws , I can say the visuals are stunning - the movie 's well shot and the settings all look great . The acting is passable , especially considering what the actors were given to work with . However , if you 're looking for the last great American Western , do yourself a favor - go rent Unforgiven instead . 3 out of 10  
  Hey Arnold ! is a slow-paced and slightly boring movie . The plot is not very creative . The Paul Sorvino character ( Shenk ) is buying all of the decrepit , low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall , shopping complex and office buildings . This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies . It is boring . Paul Sorvino is not very exciting either , so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary . Gramps remembers something about a historical document , and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga , whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk 's Mall . The kids must move around town on buses , and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly , but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids . Hey Arnold , the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining , and it has enough humor to appeal to adults . The TV cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie . Hey Arnold the movie , is about five times more sedated , and a good way to put anyone , including kiddies to sleep . Hey Arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending . If you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie , this is it . I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie , the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes . This Mall Story definitely could have been covered in the TV cartoon . Hopefully Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel .  
  The Godfather Part I was a stunning look inside the fictional Corleone family and how an innocent young man was all but forced into circumstances he never wanted to have a part of . The Godfather Part II shows that young man 's acceptance of his new role , his desensitization of character , as well as his complete loss of all innocence as he dives deeper and deeper into a life of crime . The first two parts of this saga of this transformation of Michael Corleone make for one of the greatest tragedies in cinematic history . Then , along came The Godfather Part II . Michael Corleone is now the aging Don of the Corleone family . He shows remorse for his previous actions not through subtle behaviors , but by trying to use his powers for good and admitting all his wrongdoings and regrets to others . Very cliche and uncharacteristic of the complex character that is Michael Corleone . Michael 's plans to use his powers for good are derailed by an ambitious young disciple and his enemies . Michael 's daughter is eventually a casualty of the ongoing mob wars and her death predictably leads to Michael realizing that his entire life as Don has been worthless for he has failed in the one thing that was the reason for putting himself into the position he was in : protecting his family . The Godfather Part II ends with Michael Corleone reaching the lowest of the lows : having his own brother killed . Before Part II was made , the Godfather saga was an emotionally riveting tale of an innocent young man 's journey into darkness with the unbelievably tragic end of Michael forgetting his roots and abandoning the one thing that has always mattered most to him and those around him : family loyalty . Part II paints the picture of Michael as a man who is and always has been just a victim of circumstance . This greatly corrupts the meaning of the first two films . The Godfather Part II is a horrible mess of a film that never should have been made . The only solution to the problem that is this final installment of The Godfather movies is to pretend that it does not exist and that the saga actually ends with Michael 's shockingly horrible act of having a member of his own family killed .  
  Slim Slam Slum is a sad and disappointing picture . There is absolutely no reason to this sorry excuse for a picture . Don ` t go there , what ever you do , don ` t . Watch TV-Shop for 10 hours straight instead . That way you will be slightly amused .  
  When Samantha Eggar ( as Phyllis Dietrickson ) answers the door of her house swathed in a towel , you realize that as competent an actress as Eggar may be , she doesn't have the hypnotic allure of Barbara Stanwyck . And it is not entirely Eggar 's fault . In the original film , Wilder had Stanwyck not only appear in a towel , but she enters the scene on the second floor balcony of the house . And she doesn't " come out " ; she appears , almost as if by magic . Walter Neff is staring up at her from below on the first floor . There is a reason for this . Stanwyck is much higher than Neff ( Fred MacMurray ) when they are first introduced . It is not just the towel . The towel adds to the seductive allure . Her pose is like a Greek Goddess overlooking her domain , and , in a strange way , you feel as if , from the start , she is actually controlling the entire situation . She has sexual , even magic , power . This person is no ordinary housewife . This person is a mystery with secrets hidden within . Back to 1973 . The remake has Crenna knock on the front door . Stanwyck 's stand-in , Eggar , answers the door with a towel around her . There is no " appearance " . She simply opens the door . The alluring superiority that grabs the audience at the first appearance of Stanwyck in 1944 is entirely absent in 1973 . She opens the door with a towel around her . It may be sexy in a Charlie 's Angels sort of way , but it 's not nearly as mysterious . The filmmakers of the remake seem to misunderstand Wilder 's point . The script may have said " Phyllis appears in towel " so the filmmakers of the remake simply follow the instructions and include the required towel . The point is not the towel . The point is the enigmatic quality of Phyllis , and the potential power she wields . Wilder gave her a towel to add to her mystique . The filmmakers of the remake gave her a towel because that 's what Wilder did . And in the choice of shot , lost all of Phyllis ' mystique . Richard Crenna also seems miscast . He seems like he 's " acting " and not really in the midst of the dilemma . Part of the problem is Crenna appears so much like a 70 's actor . He can't get into the 1940 's . When MacMurray first speaks into the microphone , sweat begins to drip from his face . No sweat on Crenna . And they also changed one of the crucial lines at the beginning . In the original , Neff says , " I didn't get the money , and I didn't get the woman . " In the 1973 version , Crenna says , " I didn't get the money , and I didn't want the woman . " Did the filmmakers completely misunderstand the entire point of the story ? Or were they dumbing it down for a " television " audience ? This made-for-TV movie is a by-the-numbers rendition . All the sharp edge of the original is lost . The only stand-out , maybe , is Lee J . Cobb in the role made famous by Edward G . Robinson . But he cannot save the loss of intensity of the original . This 1973 boring remake is a forgettable TV-movie made probably by the same people who did " Gilligan 's Island " . They might as well have tried to remake " Citizen Kane " or " Gone with the Wind " . If mediocrity is the best one can hope for , what 's the point ? The 1944 classic is a Film with a capital " F " . This made-for-TV remake deserves an " F " grade , or , maybe a " D " for dumb .  
  On a distant planet a psychopath is saved from execution by a space monk . He releases a few fellow inmates and breaks out of the prison in a spaceship . They dock onto a ludicrously enormous spacecraft that is orbiting a supernova star . This massive craft is populated by only three people , presumably because the budget of the film did not extend to hiring many actors . Anyway , to cut a long story short , the three goodies end up in a game of cat and mouse with the baddies . The psychopath in this movie is curious in that he is annoying . ' Annoying ' is generally not a term one would use to describe a lunatic - unhinged , frightening , dangerous maybe but not ' annoying ' but he is . The three people manning the giant ship are seriously unconvincing as warranting such important roles - this ship is practically the size of a city ! Considering that the film is set approximately 50 years in the future , it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge man-made craft could exist , never mind the fact that it is used for such a relatively mundane task . Despite the vast size of the spaceship , the crew all have appallingly kitted out , tiny rooms and the dining room consists of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs . But there are a lot of corridors . The film is fairly well acted and it works as an averagey sci-fi thriller . But nothing great .  
  I saw this on DVD ( It ` s known as CORRUPT in this format ) and the blurb on the casing really hyped up how Harvey Keitel ` s character Frank is so much like the one he played BAD LIEUTENANT in " This gritty and powerful police thriller " . What the casing didn ` t mention was that this is an old Italian movie . How old is it Theo ? Well when a character plays music he doesn ` t put on the CD player , he pulls out a big plastic pancake thing , puts it on a sort of revolving hob where a sort of mechanical arm touches the pancake thingy causing music to be heard . You see my point about this being an old film ? The DVD case gave no clue this was a movie made 20 years ago . It ` s also a film with poor production values like so many other Italian films masquerading as American ones . With the exception of Keitel the cast are awful though Johnny Rotten ` s performance is bizarre rather than terrible , the cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality giving the impression that I was watching a fourth generation pirate copy ( I don ` t know if it ` s down to a dodgy DVD or if it ` s a very bad film print ) and worst of all is Ennio Morricone ` s score . It ` s impossible to belive the man who did the irritating intrusive incidental music for CORRUPT is the same one who did the music for those Clint Eastwood westerns . All of this is a pity because CORRUPT does have its moments . It ` s by no means the greatest psycho thriller ever devised but it did hold my interest and as always Keitel puts in a good performance as a violent nutcase cop . Just a pity the rest of the movie didn ` t match up to his high standards  
  This movie was supposed to have depicted a ' ladie 's man ' bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all . However , I did not care for his mission to settle down , because I didn't care for his character . I don't understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him . He had absolutely no class , or charisma . He should 've at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing , but to no avail . Just because he is a musician does not make him sexy . Not to mention , the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous . Does this man have any shame what-so-ever ? Had he tidied up , and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character , but alas , his character was bland and boring . Gina Gershon 's character was unnecessarily British . She could 've just as easily been an uptight out-of-towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor British accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie . The only two characters I cared for were the fish and frog . Now those two had chemistry ! Academy nominations for both STAT ! Plot holes , lack of character development , horrible acting , unnecessary drama , cliché moments .. What a mess of a movie .  
  My kid makes better videos than this ! I feel ripped off of the $ 4.00 spent renting this thing ! There is no date on the video case , apparently designed by Wellspring ; and , what 's even worse , there 's no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie ! The only date given is 2002 , leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he 's getting a recent film . This movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made , that I 'm amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video . It might be of interest to students studying the counter-culture of the 1960 's , the anti-war , anti-establishment , tune-in , turn-on and drop out culture ; but when you read the back of the video case , there 's no hint that that is what you 're getting . If you do make the mistake of renting it though , it is probably best viewed while on drugs , so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors , Fassbinder and Fengler . Regardless of your state of mind while watching it , I can tell you that it doesn't get any better after the first scene ; so , knowing that , I 'm sure you 'll be fast asleep long before the end .  
  This dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent . In particular , Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are misused badly here . I might have chuckled once or twice during this film , but in general , it 's a boring movie , with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure . The premise , although routine , still wasn't bad , but once the plot was set , the film went nowhere . Don't waste your time with this misfire .  
  This movie was terrible . Throughout the whole movie , I was puzzled and did not see any point to it . I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about . This movie is not worth watching at all . Not only is it sick and revolting but totally STUPID ! Please don't watch unless you are one of those that likes to watch bad movies . If this movie questions Japanese society and their values and roles , than this is a country that i would not like to visit or bother to know . This is a totally sick movie ! I did not enjoy it because it made no sense . My boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under . It was total disappointment .  
  I 'd have to say that this was a little embarrassing for the ' King of the Cowboys ' ; made in 1948 , the picture came out a decade after Roy Rogers ' earliest pictures in which he had a starring role . Roy 's character comes off as a bit clueless in this one , along with his female co-star Jane Frazee , who alternates her allegiance between Roy and Robert Livingston , portraying chief bad guy Bill Regan . The whole story seems kind of muddled , with missed opportunities for what could have been an entertaining hour or so . Like the legend of the ' Hangman 's Hotel ' for example , which says the hanged man comes to life at midnight . With Andy Devine in the cast as Cookie Bullfincher , you would think the story would get a little mileage out of that set up . Instead , you have some convoluted proceedings that would have been better served if this had been a Bowery Boys flick . It was a sad attempt at a haunted hotel gimmick that relied on poor old Genevieve , who truth be told , wound up getting more screen time than Trigger , who 's contract as ' Smartest Horse in the Movies ' didn't have anything to say about getting upstaged by a mule . And then you have Foy Willing and his Riders of the Purple Sage replacing Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers for your musical interlude . I don't know about you , but it was already half way into the picture and I was still looking for Pat Brady - oh well ! Yet there was still an interesting element to be found here if you were looking hard enough , and that turned out to be Roy 's athletic dismount of Trigger while still on the run from the bad guys . OK , it was probably a stunt double , but I haven't seen that one before in a couple hundred Westerns . Jane Frazee does the honors as the female lead in this picture , as she would in four other films opposite Roy in the 1947/1948 time frame . In " Under California Stars " , she appeared as Andy Devine 's cousin , appropriately named Caroline Bullfincher . You 're never quite convinced what side she 'll come in on in this story though , since she starts out pretending to be someone she 's not , and winds up on the good guy side almost by accident . Fans of the old Laurel and Hardy films might be as surprised as I was to see James Finlayson here as the Sheriff of Sintown . I would have liked a little more comedy relief written into his role , but he played it pretty straight after all . I had to wonder , when it was all over , why he and old Vanderpool ( Charle Coleman ) wound up in the mine shaft with Cookie when there was no reason for that to be . Just a way to close it out I guess , with about as much thought as went into the rest of the picture . I hate to be that harsh , but if you 've seen enough Roy Rogers flicks , you 've got to know that this was not one of his finer efforts . Say , Sintown - I wonder if that 's the same place that grew up to be Sin City ?  
  Here are the matches . . . ( adv . = advantage ) The Warriors ( Ultimate Warrior , Texas Tornado and Legion of Doom ) v The Perfect Team ( Mr Perfect , Ax , Smash and Crush of Demolition ) : Ax is the first to go in seconds when Warrior splashes him for the pin ( 4-3 adv . Warriors ) . I knew Ax wasn't a healthy man but if he was that unhealthy why bother have him on the card ? This would be his last PPV . Eventually , both Legion of Doom and Demolition job out cheaply via double disqualification ( 2-1 adv . Warriors ) . Perfect applies the Perfect Plex on Texas Tornado for the pin . He then attempts the same on Warrior but Warrior no-sells it and kicks out . Warrior comes back with a splash to pin Perfect and become the sole survivor . 5/10 The Dream Team ( Dusty Rhodes , Koko B Ware and The Hart Foundation v Million Dollar Team ( Ted Dibiase , Mystery Partner and Rhythm and Blues ) : The mystery partner is The Undertaker and , on his debut , makes an impact disposing of Koko straight away with The Tombstone ( Monsoon still manages to say his correct height , weight and finishing move while pretending not to know who he is ) making it 4-3 to Dibiase 's Team . Niedhart power-slams Honky for the pin ( 3-3 ) and his career with the WWF is over . Shortly afterwards , it is Niedhart who falls victim to Dibiase with help from Virgil ( 3-2 adv . Dibiase 's team ) . Rhodes next after an Undertaker double axe-handle off the top rope but doesn't leave quietly attacking Brother Love . Undertaker goes after Dusty and gets counted out despite not being the legal man ( 2-1 adv . Dibiase 's Team ) . Almost straight after , Greg gets caught in a cradle by Hart trying to put the figure four leg-lock on him and gets pinned . It comes down to Hart v Dibiase and after a few minutes of nice wrestling , Bret gets his body-cross reversed by Dibiase for the pin . Dibiase is the sole survivor . At least Hart is put to good use . 6/10 The Vipers ( Jake ' The Snake ' Roberts , ' Superfly ' Jimmy Snuka and The Rockers ) v Visionaries ( Rick ' Model ' Martel , Warlord and Power and Glory ) : After spending some time in the ring , Marty Jannetty gets power slammed by Warlord as he comes off the top rope for the pin ( 4-3 adv . Visionaries ) . Snuka gets pinned in seconds by Martel who reverses his body cross ( 4-2 adv . Visionaries ) . Michaels gets caught in the Power Plex and pinned by Roma ( 4-1 adv . Visionaries ) . It is now Roberts against four men resembling his Survivor Series effort two years before . Despite hitting Warlord with the DDT , Roberts gets counted out chasing after Martel . The Visionaries are the first team in Survivor Series history to completely survive as one . Not much here worth watching to be honest as the psychology is rushed . 3/10 Hulkamaniacs ( Hulk Hogan , ' Hacksaw ' Jim Duggan , Bigbossman and Tugboat ) v Natural Disasters ( Earthquake , Dino Bravo , Barbarian and Haku ) : One Bossman slam eliminates Haku early in the bout ( 4-3 adv . Hulkamaniacs ) . Duggan gets his 2 by 4 out after whacking Earthquake with it to get disqualified ( 3-3 ) . Bravo commits career suicide shortly afterwards by allowing Hogan to cradle him for the pin ( 3-2 adv . Hulkamaniacs ) . Earthquake manages to overcome Bossman with two elbow drops for the pin shortly afterwards ( 2-2 ) . Hogan gets beat down and FINALLY Tugboat gets a tag ( who knew he was there at this point ? ) , he wrestles for about 30 seconds before getting counted out with Earthquake . Only Hogan and Barbarian left . Barbarian puts in some nice offence but inevitably gets caught in the big boot and leg drop for the pin . Hogan is the sole survivor . 4/10 The Alliance ( Nikolai Volkoff , Tito Santana and Bushwhackers ) v Mercenaries ( Sgt Slaughter , Boris Zhukov and Orient Express ) : All of the Mercanaries wore camouflage face paint . Lightning quick pins here with Santana pinning Zhukov in his last PPV in seconds ( 4-3 adv . Alliance ) . There wasn't even a Bolshevik showdown . Bushwhackers hit Sato with The Battering Ram even though Tanaka was the legal man ( 4-2 adv . Alliance ) and would be his last appearance on WWF PPV as The Orient Express get repackaged . Tanaka follows Sato when Santana stuns him with the flying forearm ( 4-1 adv . Alliance ) . Despite Slaughter getting in the ring against four men , he eliminates Volkoff ( who 's career is over after this ) , Butch and Luke in that order with relative ease . Finally , Santana beats Slaughter by disqualification when General Adnan hits him with Iraqi flag . At last some interesting booking even though the match was awful . Santana takes the upset victory as the sole survivor and becomes his last finest hour . 3/10 The egg hatches and it 's Hector Guerrerro in a silly outfit . He dances with Gene Okerlund and gets booed by the crowd while Piper and Monsoon pretend they are enjoying it . Match of Survival : Ultimate Warrior , Hulk Hogan and Tito Santana v Warlord , Power and Glory , Rick ' Model ' Martel and ' Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase : Just merely another catalogue of eliminations as Santana pins Warlord in seconds with flying forearm at least avenging his previous Summerslam defeat ( 4-3 adv . Dibiase 's team ) . Dibiase stun guns Santana afterwards for the pin ( 4-2 adv . Dibiase 's team ) . Hogan kicks out of The Power Plex and proceeds to pin Roma after a clothesline , effectively killing off Power and Glory 's push ( 3-2 adv . Dibiase 's team ) . Hogan eliminates Martel by count-out and Dibiase with the leg drop for the pin ( 2-1 adv . Hogan 's team ) . Hogan finally allows Warrior into the match who quickly disposes of former nemesis Hercules after a splash . A very predictable ending to the point of nauseous . 2/10 Overall , too many matches and too little time obviously had a detrimental effect as the wrestlers were almost waiting on a conveyor belt to be pinned . Most of the heels were decimated by Warrior and Hogan which is a poor way to handle a great roster of wrestlers .  
  Movie about a small town with equal numbers of Mormons and Baptists . New family moves in , cue the overwritten dialog , mediocre acting , green jello salad with shredded carrots , and every other ' inside Mormon joke ' known to man . Anyone outside the Mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this movie . Anyone inside the Mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there . You 'll be much better off watching Hess 's other movies ( Napoleon Dynamite , etc .. ) than trying to sit through this one . The acting is mediocre . Jared Hess has had his hands on much more quality films like " Saints and Soldiers " , and " Napoleon Dynamite " . I would recommend both movies over this groaner .  
  I like Brad Pitt enormously . He is an actor with brains and wit , not to mention face , pectorals and all the rest . Since I saw him in " Thelma and Louise " a thought has been bothering me , who does he remind me of ? " Troy " did it for me . He is the new Brigitte Bardot . The differences are obvious of course . Male , American etc but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind nonetheless . He is so beautiful that he is at his most effective when he plays against it . " Kalifornia " " 12 Monkeys " " Fight Club " " Snatch " His self deprecating humor makes him human , almost accessible . Fortunately " Troy " will soon be forgotten . Only still photographs with Pitt , semi naked in ravishing sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans . Strange , " Das Boot " is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th Century . What is Wolfgang Petersen doing directing this ? Well , I suppose it would be very hard to say no at the chance of working with the new Brigitte Bardot .  
  Back when I was a kid and I lived with my sister , she bought every horror movie she could find and this was one of them . VCR 'S had just became a household item and we didn't have but about 150 movies and we watched the hell out of all of them . I was at a yard sale the other day and I saw this VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I buy any horror movie I don't have and I knew this movie looked familiar . I thought for a second and realized it was one that my sister had bought . She had sold it years ago in a yard sale I am guessing - who knows . I didn't recall anything at all about it and I watched it the night I bought it and it refreshed my memory because of a few scenes . I am not sure how I felt about it as a kid but I am sure I enjoyed it because it was new to me and I 'd watch and enjoy anything back then . I am a horror freak , but there are certain requirements in order for me to consider it " good " and this one fell very short . It was one of those talk talk talk and bore me to death types . What death scenes you see are done using the shadow on the wall followed by blood splatter and thats if you 're lucky you get that much . The story is good and I have seen a few with similar plots , so I think this one should be buried and forgotten . Don't watch this people unless you 're hard up .  
  There 's really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis . I mean it 's Shakespeare 's Hamlet for goodness sake  probably one of the best known plays ever written . I 'm not embarrassed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet the way most people on IMDb have  through Mystery Science Theater 3000 . While the show may not be the best venue to use to judge a movie , in this case I cannot imagine attempting to watch it without the comedic quips . In a word , this German , made-for-TV version of Hamlet is dreary . 152 minutes ? No way ! It 's too dark and depressing to be anything I want to spend almost three hours on . I 've said it any number of times , but entertainment is the thing for me . And this wrist-slitter is far from entertaining . I will , however , give it a couple of points for what I felt was some reasonably good acting . A 3/10 sounds about right to me . As much as I enjoy MST3K , their comments don't help to make Hamlet any more palatable . There are a few good riffs here and there , but overall , Hamlet is just the wrong movie for MST3K . Shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow . As much as it pains me , I 've got to give Hamlet a 1/5 on my MST3K rating scale .  
  Now don't get me wrong . If you need an insightful summary of everything that been wrong with the history of human civilization as well as a flawless path to brighter future for mankind , who better to turn to than a comedian and practitioner of pop culture ? If you need a healthy dose of all the solid , sound reasons why religion has outlived it 's usefulness then turn to Sagan or Dawkins , not BILL MAHER for God 's ( ? ) sake ! That 's a good point in and of itself . Maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder conveniently ignoring how his entire society , art and science is rooted in it . In this film , he relies heavily on his keenly-honed skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while attempting to appear erudite and wise . Unfortunately , his intellect isn't up to the task . Maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box . As an example , he responds to an interviewee 's ( and I use the term loosely as they were clearly all " ambushees " ) assertion that the existence of Jesus is historical fact with a deadpan " No , it 's not " followed by a long stare meant to convey contempt at the subject 's naivety ( a device nauseatingly overused in this film ) . The problem is that the person was correct and Maher dead wrong in his assertion that Jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically - suspect gospels . I guess Mr . Maher has never read the contemporary historian Josephus . But the masses will flock to this pseudo-documentary as they do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like Michael Moore , and they will loudly bray and guffaw ( they certainly did at my showing ) . It 's doubly telling , however , that the loudest and most mule-like braying occurred during the approximately 70 % of the running time that the film devoted to it 's anti-Christian tirade while the audience was wholly mute during the token 10 % devoted to criticizing the self-described Religion of Peace . Hmm . Either criticism of Islam is off-limits to the hip and liberal target audience or they were just afraid to laugh . Very telling , either way ..  
  this movie is not good . the first one almost sucked , but had that unreal ending to make it worth watching . this one has nothing . there 's zero scare , zero tension or suspense . this isn't really a horror movie . most of the kills don't show anything . there 's no gore to speak of . this could almost be a TV , except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence . the acting is not very good , either . and don't get me started on the dialogue . as for the surprise ending , surprise , there isn't one . i suppose it could have been worse , although i don't see how . but then again , it is less than 80 minutes long , so i guess that 's a good thing . although it felt a lot longer . apparently this is the cut version of the film . i found it for a very cheap price , but it still not worth it . if you want the uncut more graphic version , check out the Anchor Bay edition . anyway , this version of Sleepaway Camp II : Unhappy Campers gets a big fat 1/10 from me . p . s . if you watch this movie , you will probably be a bored and unhappy camper . if you are a real fan , you might want to pick up Anchor Bay 's Sleepaway Camp ( with survival kit ) three disc collection containing the first three movies uncut and with special features  
  Me and my friend rented this movie for $ 2.50 . And we both agree on one thing : THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE ! Also me and my friend counted 475 face shots . ( Which makes up 95 % of the movie ) . So in other words : DO SEE THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU LIKE WASTING MONEY ! And I do !  
  Worst De Niro Scorsese collaboration in this horrible agonizing violent overlong mess . Scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with the horror cliched suddenly loud phone ringing and door slamming gimmicks that seem laughable and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman . The cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced . Nick Noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone ! De Niro 's psychotic Bowden is nothing more than the typical 90 's movie psycho killer . The scene with De Niro and Lewis early on is very awkward and the climax goes on and on and we should all be more than tired of the on psycho stalker that never dies . One of my most horrible movie experiences . Rent the original it 's 100 times better .  
  I don't see much reason to get into this movie in much detail . Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo , author and survivor of " A Season in Hell " , recruited from prison by his only friend , Major Richard Crenna , to secretly return to Vietnam , take photos of the American prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps , and return without engaging the enemy . Fat chance . What if he actually DID nothing more than sneak in , take pics , and sneak out ? Who would come to see the movie ? It 's essentially a celebration of Stallone 's muscles . Preparing for his mission , we see his well-oiled muscles bulging . ( They are oiled and bulging throughout . ) There is the ritual strapping on of black leather , ugly guns , and even uglier knives . The black guns are cleaned , assembled with loud clacks , and almost as oiled as Stallone 's muscles . The bow is tested and , yes , it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemy 's forehead . The knife is sharpened with slick snicks . Stallone and one of his POWs are betrayed by one or two of the suits from Washington , cynical politicians who , you can bet , were never even in a fist fight in grammar school . No guts , you know ? Just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer . The movie does what it set out to do , but what it set out to do is meretricious . It deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid-1980s that there were uncountable numbers of MIAs quietly kept in wretched camps by the North Vietnamese . The bumper stickers were ubiquitous . ( Free Our MIAs . ) Why would they keep them ? It was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the POWs into a slave labor force - in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor . Or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the United States - a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world . As a captive , Rambo is treated in a Medieval fashion by the North Vietnamese . Dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists , his muscles still on display . Then , not content with subhuman Vietnamese , a Russian officer is brought in to play the part of the Gestapo officer - " Vee haff vays of MAKING you remember . " A high-tech type , the Russian uses psychology and electricity , not just pig dump . Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until " this country loves us as much as we love it , " bringing up another myth that Vets returning from Vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed , which is why I guess we elected so many to the Congress and appointed others to high-echelon positions . The last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group . At least Rambo 's aimless drifting left room open for a sequel , which arrived apace . The action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but Rambo is humorless . It marches dully through it 's phantasmal ideological swamp , killing without mercy , barely speaking , barely able to speak . To speak is a sign of weakness .  
  George P . Cosmatos ' " Rambo : First Blood Part II " is pure wish-fulfillment . The United States clearly didn't win the war in Vietnam . They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh-so innocent soldiers . The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation , who made this war happen . The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this . He is extremely patriotic , bemoans that US-Americans didn't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier , but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians . Like every film that defends the war ( e . g . " We Were Soldiers " ) also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in South Asia . And for that matter also the reason for every single US-American soldier that was there . Instead , Rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation . It would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories , rather than suppressing them . " Do we get to win this time ? " Yes , you do .  
  Blood Surf AKA Krocodylus is a fair film that has an okay cast which includes Dax Miller , Taryn Reif , Kate Fischer , Duncan Regehr , Joel West , Matt Borlenghi , Maureen Larrazabal , Cris Vertido , Susan Africa , Archie Adamos , Rolando Santo Domingo , and Malecio Amayao . The acting by the actors is fairly good . The thrills are fairly good and some of it is surprising . The movie is filmed fairly good as well . Same thing goes for the music The film is fairly interesting and the movie does keeps you going until the end . This is a fairly thrilling film . If you the the cast in the film , Monsters , Giant Animal films , Horror , Thrillers , Mystery , and interesting films then I recommend you to see this film today !  
  The special effects of this movie are , especially for its time , laughable and used in such an over-emphasized way that you can't deny their terrible existance . The acting redefines the term " terrible overacting " at the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul , where julie Newman and Andrew Divoff just redefine " bad " . * spoilers * The charm in this movie can be found in two things : First is the excellent casting of Carel " Lurch " Struycken as the mysterious psychic Gaunt , who can sense where and when people will die and is always there . The second are original finds , the combination SF-Western is obviously original , if terrible , but other finds are more original , like the gunman Zack Stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots ( though his acting falls short here ) . Overal .. don't see this movie , except if you love that ol ' hunk-o-brutal Carel Struycken , as any self-respecting Dutchman should .  
  When watching this show you are not quite sure whether it is the story or the acting that is more annoying . First of all , the storyline of each episode is very predictable , the writers must have used every cliché possible , you can guess not only the general plot , but the arrangement of the scenes and also the lines of each character , making the show some sort of a collage of every police series out there . On the top of it all comes the " message " of the show , that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good shall prevail and that we should all love each other , be better man and better citizens , all done in the most ostensible manner . The actors , as the vehicles of this message and nothing more than that , will use a limited set of acting skills : the " I am a good carrying person " smile , the concerned look and the " victory is ours " body posture , while the bad guys have the " I 'm a bad one " frowning and the " you caught me " look , followed by the " I 'm good for nothing and I should be removed from society " head banding ( this kind of also sums up the general development of each show ) . True story or not , the show is garbage , yet another proof that producers don't give a s * t about viewers , that we are all thought to be idiots . Well this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brains out of you .  
  Making the film as dark and visually fuzzy as possible in order to cover up the budget deficiencies is an often-used strategy in low-budget horror films , but this one takes it too far . It is SO poorly lit and murky ( and it takes place almost entirely at night , to boot ) that you often end up virtually looking at a black screen ( although perhaps the bad video transfer may also have had something to do with that ) . Alas , " murky " is also the best word to describe the movie 's plot . The filmmakers throw in diverse ( and unoriginal ) horror ideas without any semblance of logic , and halfway through you get the feeling that they just about abandoned the effort to make a good horror film ; you know it when you see characters who are supposed to be in mortal danger ( or , in some occasions , even dead ) making small talk ..

  Witchcraft / Witchery / La Casa 4 / and whatever else you wish to call it . How about .. Crud . A gathering of people at a Massachusetts island resort are besieged by the black magic powers of an evil witch killing each individual using cruel , torturous methods . Photographer Gary ( David Hasselhoff ) is taking pictures for Linda ( Catherine Hickland whose voice and demeanor resemble EE-YOR of the Winnie the Poo cartoon ) , a virgin studying witchcraft , on the island resort without permission . Rose Brooks ( Annie Ross , portraying an incredibly rude bitch ) is interested in perhaps purchasing the resort and , along with husband Freddie ( Robert Champagne , who is always ogling other women much younger than him ) , pregnant daughter Jane ( Linda Blair ) and grandson Tommy ( Michael Manchester , who just looks bored throughout , probably wanting to watch Sesame Street instead of starring in this rubbish ) , go by boat to the resort being treated to a look at the property by Realtor Tony Giordano 's son Jerry ( Rick Farnsworth ) , obviously a pup in the business getting his feet wet . Along with these folks is architect Leslie ( Leslie Cumming , whose character is a nympho ) who might help Rose re-design the resort . The boat 's captain is killed by The Lady in Black ( Hildegard Knef , wearing her make-up and lip-stick extra thick ) and a storm is brewing . The boat drives off by itself ( .. guided by the invisible power of The Lady in Black , I guess ) with everyone stuck in the decrepit resort , which is in dire need of repairs . Most of the victims , before meeting their grisly fates are carried through a type of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension ( .. perhaps a type of hell or something ) where they are tortured by these fiends dressed in raggedy clothes with a crummy visage . One victim has her mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney , roasted as the others light the fireplace . One poor soul is tortured by harsh twistings of rope wrapped tightly around her flesh before being found hanging from the snout of a swordfish penetrating through her neck . One fellow is slowly suffocating as his veins bulge ( .. and bleed ) and neck 's blood vessels burst squirting in Hasselhoff 's face ! One fellow is crucified with nails hammered into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame . Blair 's pregnant victim becomes possessed with her hair standing on end speaking in another woman 's voice . One is raped by this demonic man with a " diseased " mouth as the hellish hobos stand nearby gleefully cheering . The film , despite it 's excesses , is mostly dull fodder for those who really wish to see the lowest point in the careers of Hasselhoff and Blair , who deserve better than this . Almost unbearable at times , building little-to-no suspense . Clumsy execution of the death sequences which look cheap and laughable . Sure some gore is okay , but most of the film shows victims after they 've been run through the ringer . We do get a chance to see pregnant women ( .. who look exactly like stuntmen in costume with bad wigs ) jumping out three story windows . Oh , and The Lady in Black 's reflected face often pops up on inanimate objects for characters to see . Tommy has a little Sesame Street recorder which tapes The Lady in Black 's mumbo jumbo chants , obviously used for later . For some reason , The Lady in Black likes to visit little Tommy . He 's not at all scared of her , for Tommy 's just too bored to show any expression on his face , much less fear . Need I say more ? This one 's a real stinker . Ugh .  
  This was a rip-off of the same garbage we had to watch Bob Saget host during the half-hour before this . Dave Coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as America 's Funniest Home Videos except with a hosts who have a combined IQ of three . Tawny Kitaen must 've really needed the money and Coulier had to go to the recycle bin for his jokes . It was torture enough having to see him imitate Popeye and other washed up cartoon starts on Full House . That one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a Grade A wedgie . Coulier must 've needed to money to please Alannis Morisette while they were dating .  
  Loony Tunes have ventured ( at least ) twice into the future . The first time was with the brilliantly funny " Duck Dodgers " . The latter time was with this  um  effort . " Loonatics Unleashed " isn't without merit , and might be considered a good product were it not that it isn't up to Warner Brothers quality . WB cartoons are noted for their cheeky humor , appealing at least as much to adults as to children . These pedestrian superhero episodes , on the other hand , cannot fail to convince adults to pass them up . The premise of the series is that 6 ordinary individuals ( 2 bunnies , a Tasmanian devil , a duck , a roadrunner , and a coyote ) live on the " city-planet " of Acmetropolis and acquire super powers when a meteor strikes the planet in 2772 . What 's confusing is that the titles section features these individuals with a count-up to 2772 from the 21st Century . Cute , but frelling stupid . In each episode , the super sextet  amid mildly amusing but essentially banal banter  fight various super villains . For the most part , these are types that appear in every mediocre superhero adventure series and even some of the better ones . Like many mediocre superhero series , this one takes its villains far too seriously for the context . And of course these guys are the only characters that laugh  the usual evil laugh , of course . Why is it that villains in predictable superhero adventures always  ALWAYS  laugh evilly at every opportunity ? Animated material of this sort seems to leave laughter exclusively in the province of villains and ( occasionally ) their henchpeople and / or henchthings . In point of fact , the makers of this series missed their best bets right from the get-go . The superpowers of the characters are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities , but sometimes not . The problem here is that we don't see enough WB looniness . Lexi and Ace have fairly ordinary biologically generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits one could describe as " Bugs-like " . What we have here is basically the silly and drekish " Teen Titans " , including its overly " modern " animation " look " , but with animals . Feh . The other misstep by the program 's creators is ( or are ) the villains . As noted before , these are not terribly imaginative and do the evil-laugh bit excessively . Amazingly , the writers totally missed the obvious technique of making villains from stock WB characters as well as the protagonists . Adding to the fun could have been , say , Jupiter Sam  as well as The Fudd , still hunting wabbits  as well as Tech E . Coyote converted into a really neurotic villain  and so on . Ah , the sadness of missed opportunities . Sadly , this whole production has gone into too much overtime ( that is , a 2nd season ) . Nevertheless , we can rejoice that there 's something new out there for the 14-going-on-9 crowd . The rest of us can hope for a 3rd season of Duck Dodgers .  
  Relying on the positive reviews above , we saw a free screening of this last night . Now I KNOW that filmmakers plant positive reviews , because there is no way an objective individual could have written these . " Destined to become a ' cult classic ' " ? The theater was packed , apparently with friends and families of the production crew , because only a few of us walked out by the first hour . The songs were the most literal I 've ever heard in a musical  " don't take the short cut , honey , there 's a wolf in the woods .. " . Debi Mazar 's eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing . Fortunately , most of the tunes lasted for only a few lines . Now , whoever plays the wolf in this tale should be charming and seductive . Instead , we get Joey Fatone , ex N'Syncer , living up to his last name as he 's not aged well . He 's not exactly lithe with his extra 50 pounds and junior high school-quality makeup and out-of-tune singing . Seriously , this guy was in vocal group ? The rest of the actors are semi-adequate , but can't do much about the unimaginative script . You know , it is possible to write for adults and children at the same time  see under " Pixar " . On the positive side , the virtual sets looked nice and were well-integrated with the actors . And it wasn't as offensive as " Crash " .  
  Manipulative drama about a glamorous model ( Margaux Hemingway ) who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician ( Chris Sarandon ) – to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister ( played by real-life sibling Mariel ) , whose music teacher he is . While the central courtroom action holds the attention – thanks largely to a commanding performance by Anne Bancroft as Hemingway’s lawyer – the film is too often merely glossy , but also dramatically unconvincing : the jury ostensibly takes the musician’s side because a ) the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b ) she was offering no resistance to her presumed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together . What the f * ? ! ; she was clearly tied up – what resistance could she realistically offer ? The second half of the film – involving Sarandon’s rape of the sister , which curiously anticipates IRREVERSIBLE ( 2002 ) by occurring in a tunnel – is rather contrived : Mariel’s character should have known better than to trust Sarandon after what he did to her sister , but Margaux herself foolishly reprises the line of work which had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately ! The climax – in which Sarandon gets his just desserts , with Margaux turning suddenly into a fearless and resourceful vigilante – is , however , a crowd-pleaser in the style of DEATH WISH ( 1974 ) ; incidentally , ubiquitous Italian movie mogul Dino De Laurentiis was behind both films . It’s worth noting how the two Hemingway sisters’ lives took wildly different turns ( this was the film debut of both ) : Margaux’s career never took off ( despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here ) – while Mariel would soon receive an Oscar nomination for Woody Allen’s MANHATTAN ( 1979 ) and , interestingly , would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when essaying the role of real-life “Playboy” centerfold Dorothy Stratten in Bob Fosse’s STAR 80 ( 1983 ) . With the added pressure of a couple of failed marriages , Margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in 1996 ; chillingly , the Hemingway family had a history of suicides – notably the sisters’ grandfather , celebrated author Ernest , who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1961 .  
  And that comes from someone that will withstand almost ANY viewing . The acting and sound is awful . This might qualify for a " so bad it 's good " point of merit , for some . However I take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap-it 's just soo cheap , I think that 's my major complaint . The dialogue is often hilarious-attention to how many times " you startled me " is used . The " child " actress is seriously god awful-I pray her acting career ended here .. her line " DONUTS ! I HATE DONUTS " is worth repeated viewing however .  
  Beating the bad guys .. Again is the tag line for this movie , it exposes so much truth about it . Home Alone one and two , film classics . Home Alone three and four , a good film if you 're three ! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl , as hard as it tries to be funny , it 's not . Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else . He 's a very bland actor with bland performances , but it 's not entirely his fault , the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions . The pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks , and you 'd have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real . A good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day . And to make things worst , a totally different cast , go see if you don't believe me , but you 'll regret it .  
  This movie could have been 15 minutes long if it weren't for all the bickering between son and father . Very predictable . Both Male " stars " need a good slap in the face ! Would you like some cheese with that " whine ? " Two chuckles .. and a headache . I can understand why the mother left her hubby after 47 years .. I don't know how she lasted that long ! The first 5 minutes made me want to turn the movie off wishing I had never paid the $ 3.99 to watch it ! The movie didn't flow well and was painfully long . I kept watching my watch hoping time would fly faster .. It didn't . The script had so much repetition that it had to be easy for the writer to fill space . On a positive note .. the scenery was pretty , fall being my favorite season . The car , the 40 Ford was also quite nice . This movie gets an D- rating approaching an F  
  Don't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series . It is a six hour bore , an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other . There is no heat in this story , no real passion , no real romance . It is a dry , boring , drawn out , and uninspired as they come . And it doesn't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency . Take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile .  
  This dreadful film assembles every Asian stereotype you can imagine into one hideous package . Money grubbing , devious Japanese business men send goofy but loveable policeman Pat Morita to recover industrial secrets in Detroit . Here he encounters a down at heel Jay Leno , who promptly refers to a murder victim as a Jap and calls Morita Tojo . It 's all downhill from there .  
  Collusion Course is even worse than the typical " evil white male corporate capitalist " movie of the week . This movie is less pleasant than a toothache . Jay Leno can act . He 's good in his underrated debut movie , The Silverbears , in which he gives a performance consist with the demands of his character . This movie is so bad Leno 's character , a sanctimonious buffoon , is less annoying than Morita 's character , a sanctimonious fool .  
  " The Bubble " is an effort to make a gay Romeo & Juliet type of story with an Israeli and a Palestinian , although it seems to come at it by way of " Friends " or " Beverly Hills 90210 . " The characters are shallow and trite as are the dialog and plot line . The movie seems torn between fluff and depth . On the one hand there is a pointed effort at being shallow as ( in one example of many ) some minor characters even ask questions that invite development of insight into the conflicts at hand , and get answers like , " Hey , we 're here to make a poster for a rave against the occupation . Don't get political ! " Beyond the obvious absurdity of such a line , it 's just one of many ham-fisted signals that the movie is just as hollow and insubstantial as its title suggests . On the other hand , the movie 's main pretension to depth follows the lovers to a presentation of " Bent " a play about gays in a Nazi labor camp . The scene on stage is awkwardly rushed , undermining its erotic power ( understandable given the constraints of film-time , but still this could have been edited to much better effect . ) and comes off as flimsily as the rest of the film . Too bad . This play deserves much better . The characters are so one-dimensionally cartoony some even have names that telegraph their entire ( though the word seems inappropriate here ) substance . The aggressive soldier from the crack Golani brigade is named " Golan . " The militant Palestinian is named " Jihad . " The striving-for-chic faghag roommate is " Lulu . " Anyone familiar with the checkpoints and life in Palestine , whether from real life or documentaries will find the checkpoint scenes as absurdly unreal as well , the rest of this fluffy fantasy . When a Palestinian woman goes into the fastest labor on record Israeli soldiers are solicitous and helpful , an ambulance shows up in minutes . ( The outcome of the birth serves to show the Palestinians as unappreciative of Israeli beneficence and even downright paranoiac . ) Altogether the checkpoint is shown as a mere nuisance , not the series of bone-numbing , soul-crushing , humiliating obstructions with no regard for medical care or necessity in cases of birth , death , or severe illness . Ashraf , the Palestinian lover , seems to get through from Nablus to Tel Aviv with no problems , no papers , no hassles . He just shows up whenever he likes . When the Israelis want to get through it is much more of a challenge involving a scheme worthy of Lucy Ricardo . Against the backdrop of nice , supportive Israelis and surly homophobic Palestinians we move to a resolution that is utterly lacking in motivation or purpose  except as a painfully obvious dramatic device to milk sympathy for the forbidden lovers . Gay Israeli-Palestinian romance has been handled on stage with much more skill and depth as in Saleem 's " Salaam / Shalom " so this film is hardly even as groundbreaking as some people would like to think . Gloriously bad films  like the works of Ed Wood - at least have some striking idiosyncrasy to distinguish them . This one doesn't even have that going for it . Most of the sound track sounds like Simon and Garfunkel on quaaludes , and even with the weird oedipal touches to the gay sex scenes , the general incompetence that pervades this movie plays out like a mediocre TV movie of the week .  
  A reasonable effort is summary for this film . A good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement . Maggie Smith gave a decent performance which was believable enough but not as good as she could have given , other actors were just dreadful ! A terrible portrayal . It wasn't very funny and so it didn't really achieve its genres as it wasn't particularly funny and it wasn't dramatic . The only genre achieved to a satisfactory level was romance . Target Audiences were not hit and the movie sent out confusing messages . A very basic plot and a very basic storyline were not pulled off or performed at all well and people were left confused as to why the film wasn't as good and who the target audiences were etc . However Maggie was quite good and the storyline was alright with moments of capability . 4 .  
  I can't figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad . It 's like the TV station are desperate for anything , anything at all . They 're buried underneath a bunch of snow , the electricity constantly flashes on and off , yet magically there is a background light that stays constant . Where does all this ( fake ) light come from ? That , and all that stupid bickering between the characters . They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive . It tries to create that feel of emergency and people helping . But because it 's such bad directing and acting , you will not your Florence Nightingale fix with this flick , sorry . I 'm joining the negative feedback , and I concur that this is one of the worst movies ever .  
  This movie was rented by a friend . Her choice is normally good . I read the cover first and was expecting a good movie . Although it was a horror movie . Which i don't prefer . But no horror came to mind while watching the movie . It was a dull , not very entertaining movie . The appearance of Denise Richards was again a pleasure for the eye . But that 's it . We ( the four of us ) we 're a little bit disappointed . But feel free to see this movie and judge it yourself .  
  Wow . Watching this film today , you can't help but be appalled by the writing of this film . Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young play a couple who , in modern times , might be featured on " The Jerry Springer Show " - as they have a sick and abusive relationship .. and inexplicably , the writers appear to be endorsing it ! The film begins with a hungry and homeless Loretta being shown the ropes by the poor but very resourceful Spencer Tracy . He shows her how by conniving you can do very well with little money and takes her home to his shack to stay . It 's never clear whether or not they marry-and considering it 's a Pre-Code film , you can assume they aren't even though they are cohabiting . Their relationship is very strange .. and rather sick . While you can see that Tracy cares about her by his actions , he is verbally abusive and a total jerk-and Young comes running back for more like some sort of dog . He calls her " skinny " or " ugly " and these are , in a sick way , his way of using endearments ! Later , when he starts fooling around with another woman ( Glenda Farrell ) , she tells her friend that if that 's what he wants , it 's okay with her ! It sure smacks of a sado-masochistic relationship and you can't help but feel a bit horrified . Sure , he doesn't hit her but the relationship is very abusive . To show how sick it is , when Young gets pregnant , she tells him " .. it 's your baby and it 's mine , but you don't need to worry , I 'll take all the blame for it " ! Yikes ! Doesn't this all seem a bit like looking through a peephole into a sick and dysfunctional home ? ! Later , in a case of art imitating life , Tracy proves what sort of man he is and disappears . After all , he can't be burdened with a baby-even if it 's his . But , he changes his mind and decides to return home . Wow .. that 's bit of him ! And , when he returns , he 's nasty and acts like IF he stays , he isn't obligated to care for the kid ! And , she tells him he 's " a free man .. free as a bird " ! Wow , I was almost in tears at this tender moment .. NOT ! Soon , this crazy pair are married .. and , naturally , Young is depressed because he seems to be staying as long as it suits him-not because of any love or sense of responsibility . So how can you salvage anything with this sort of sick characters ? What would you do ? Well , as for the writers , they have Tracy soon commit a robbery to help pay for the brat ! The romantic aspects of the film are underwhelming to say the least ! During the robbery , Tracy behaves like a chump-doing almost nothing to take precautions not to get caught-like he was secretly hoping to get sent to prison . And , to show what sort of nice guy he is , the guy he tries to rob is one of his best friends . While there 's more to the film , the bottom line is that Tracy is a jerk and Young is an idiot in the film . Despite both being very good actors , there 's absolutely no way they could make anything of this crap the writers produced . Nice music , nice sets , good acting .. and a script that is 100 % poo . How the film is currently rated 7.4 is beyond me and I wonder how anyone can ignore the pure awfulness of the characters . A horrible misfire that somehow didn't destroy the careers of those involved . Oh , and if you wonder if Loretta EVER gets a backbone in this film or plays a person who is the least bit strong , the answer is NO ! By the end , she 's learned nothing and hasn't changed one whit for the better . They sure don't make films like they used to .. and in this case .. thank God !  
  While flipping through the channels on a late Saturday night , my friends and I stumbled across this film . First of all , Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as a Native American ? Seriously ? ! His accent was breaking through so much , although his character was apparently Scottish . Next , I was stunned to find that this film was made after he had already played James Bond / Agent 007 at least twice . This movie plays up the stereotypes , with the inspiring professor figure . The girl who played Pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut . And , this film won an award ? I cannot believe it . Brosnan is an attractive man , but we seriously wanted to gauge our eyes out after watching this for just 10 seconds . We switched from " Kicking and Screaming " to this , and we wanted to switch back . We watched the 1995 children 's classic " The Indian in the Cupboard " earlier in the night , which also discussed the Iroquois . The following line represents our desire to run away : " Take me outside , earth grasper . " From " Grey Owl " : " If you don't like it , you don't have to watch . "  
  I have recently watched this movie twice , and I can't seem to understand why the h * ll the makers made this pile of crap . I mean , yes , It gives a great impression of Hitler 's environment , and I mean the way they reproduced Austria in the late 1890 's , WWI and the Inter-war period . What I can't understand is why they pictured Hitler as a 100 % pure evil , mad , unreliable , mentally unstable freak . He was after all a very thoughtful , loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides , no doubt about that . But why in heaven 's name portray him in this way ? All of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario , leaving nothing but a very propaganda-like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever . Yes , he threw Germany into the devastating 2nd World War . Yes , he was racist , and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war . All true . But again ; why the hell did they plain LIE to the public ? To warn us ? I absolutely don't think this movie was a warning . The true danger of Hitler and the Nazi 's was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness . The fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every German alive ( not to mention Austrians and a LOT of other people ) makes it a warning to modern civilization , NOT the fact Hitler was such a ' weirdo ' . If it would have been like the makers make us believe - I would have been convinced that the German people were retarded . A man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader - not to mention ReichsKanzler . 4/10  
  Simply put , this is a simplistic and one dimensional film . The title , The Rise to Evil , should tell you that this isn't going to attempt to be anything deep or do much with Hitler 's character . Rather , from the first minutes of the movie where we see baby Hitler looking evil with evil music playing the background , we are given a view of Hitler that presents his as a cartoony supervillian , seemingly ripped right out of a Saturday morning TV show . The film REALLY wants to make its case that Hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil ? Ultimately , making him such a one-dimensionally evil character is both boring and confusing ( one must ask how the inept , phsycotic character in the film cold ever persuade a nation to follow him or be named Time 's man of the year ) . This film had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrible acts in the 20th century , and try to delve into his mind . Instead , it basically just says , " Hey ! Hitler was evil ! Just thought you might like to know .. " over and over again . The great irony is that the film still was attacked for presenting too sympathetic a view of the character . Give me a break .  
  I am a big fan of the Spaghetti Western Genre , and I usually also like most of the cheaply made ones . Infamous Director Demofilo Fidani , however , is rightly known for some of the cheapest , trashiest , and , well , worst contributions to the genre . The plots of Fidani 's movies were usually very weak , and since his talent was quite limited , he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous Spaghetti Western names like " Django " of " Sartana " to the titles . I the particular case of " Giù La Testa .. Hombre " of 1971 he just took the title of Sergio Leone 's " Giù La Testa " ( aka . " Duck You Sucker " ) and added ' Hombre ' . The movie can be found under various titles ( " Fistful Of Death " , " Western Story " .. ) , I personally bought it under the name " Adios Companeros " , which this movie shares with another Fidani film with almost the same cast , " Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari " , which is also entitled " Adios Companeros " in the German language version . The plot is rather weak , it basically follows a guy named Macho Callaghan ( Jeff Cameron ) and his involvement with two rivaling outlaw gangs lead by Butch Cassidy ( Jack Betts ) and Ironhead ( Gordon Mitchell ) . The leading performance by Jeff Cameron is , kindly stated , not very convincing . Neither did I find Jack Betts very good as ' Butch Cassidy ' . B-movie legend Gordon Mitchell , however , is always worth a try , and although he probably wasn't a very good actor , I always found his performances in the Spaghetti Westerns quite funny and original , and he actually saved some of Fidani 's movies ( such as the rather crappy " Django And Sartana .. Showdown in the West " ) . There is one very funny and original thing about " Giù La Testa .. Hombre " - the great Klaus Kinski is playing a priest ! I could have imagined Kinski in any role , but before seeing this movie I would never have guessed that anybody would cast him as a priest . Kinski is , once again , great , although he has only little screen time , and one scene , where he breaks up a fight , is probably the only good scene in this . One more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and king of sleaze Joe D'Amato did the cinematography . " Giù La Testa .. Hombre " is a cheap , crappy film , but nevertheless , it has some funny moments . Being a Spaghetti Western enthusiast , I found it fun to watch , but if you 're not , never mind this movie , or watch it only for the purpose of seeing Kinski play a priest . 3/10  
  The Flock is not really a movie . It 's a wannabe movie , with wannabe actors . Not including Richard Gere , he gave an excellent performance , but when only one of the actors truly gives himself to his character , and the rest of the cast is just acting .. the result is pathetic , just like this movie . You see , the idea of acting is to hide the fact that you 're acting . What the hell was Claire Dains doing in this one ? ! She 's the most inappropriate actress for this character . In 99.9 % of the movie she looked extremely out of place , out of everything ! The only thing she was doing was asking stupid questions , like " do you really think so ? " , and making silly faces . I was embarrassed by her acting , seriously , and I used to like her .. She 's the romantic movie type , I don't know who picked her among all the actresses out there .. LOL , and seeing Avril Lavigne ? ! this really made me laugh .. Anyway .. If you want to get the feeling of throwing up , this movie will do the job for you ! I wish I could vote -5 ..  
  it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing . The first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go . You shouldn't really decide to watch this based on my review or not . I saw so little of it I shouldn't even really be commenting but suddenly it all became clear why the video shop guy was sniggering at us paying money to see it . Couldn't they have just made Earnest does Dallas ?  
  I saw this movie a couple years back . I could'nt sleep and there was nothing on . So I peeped it . What really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing . Richard gets tied up in chicken wire and Jarvis starts making out with Richard 's girl while she 's unconscious . Then Jarvis 's buddy Troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar . By the next morning it shows Richard 's girl talking to Jarvis and Trouby and then she walks back to Richard and looks at him while he 's still tied up . Then they play some happy music and the movie is finished . I mean what happened ? Did they brake up ? And what was she saying to those 2 guys ( Trouby and Jarvis ) ? Its to puzzling and to poor to . I can't stand movies that are disturbing and don't make sense . This was the worst film i 've ever seen since the 90 's version of Lord of the Flies .  
  This movie will be a hit with those that enjoy sophomoronic , mindless , explicit bragging about sexual exploits and F .. in almost every sentence . Like a good plot ? Like comedy ? Like romance or other human values ? Stay away from Whipped . It was so bad I left after about half an hour . I saw two kids slip in that looked to be about 10 - very harmful - this deserves an X .  
  Final Score : 0 ( out of 10 ) * Possible scene specific spoilers ( but who the hell cares ) * Yes , that 's right : zero . And I rarely give 1 's . Even for the lamest of movies I look for things like music , cinematography , imagination , it 's humor , even a good pace to be as objective about the score as possible . Looking at it within it 's own genera or subgenera . But there is absolutely nothing redeeming here . I can't remember another time a movie actually sent me pacing up and down the room when it was over . The only reason I made it to the end was because I couldn't seem to change the channel - I sat there simply aghast , watching to see what insultingly stupid bit it would come up with next . It was like watching a snake digest a rat . But let 's have some fun and pull this baby apart , shall we . First of all , There is nothing technical about " Whipped " that works . The visuals are all sitcom style . The cut scenes all just pictures of the street traffic going by at night over and over . The music and score , not only doesn't contribute anything to the movie - it 's obnoxious . Not to mention it doesn't have anything to contribute to anyway . The acting is as cardboard as it comes , all around and that goes for Amanda Peet ( clearly the " star " that got this train wreck green-lighted ) too . These guys , supposedly good friends , have no more chemistry or sense of purpose then if director Peter M . Cohen had rounded them up at a bus station minutes before shooting . On the creative side , there isn't an original bone in it 's body . It has no imagination . It shows us nothing we haven't seen a thousand times before . The whole premise , or " twist " , of this movie is based on male-bashing and the " idea " that an empowered women can play men " just as they get played " . Anybody , that thinks this is somehow a twist or is in any way original has obviously never turned on a TV before . Twisted , shallow women are common . Male-bashing is the norm . It 's not stealing from anything specifically , it 's worse : it 's stealing from clichés . I can't imagine a women making a movie that depicted other women based so much on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt . Makes me want to go rent " In the Company of Men " - or better yet , " There 's Something About Mary " . This movie wants to be a " edgier " version of " There 's Something About Mary " so bad you can see the sweat . The movie has no insights into women , men , dating , sex , or really anything . Cohen is simply content to regurgitate myths he has been indoctrinated with from other sexist movies . On the other end , the movie doesn't work as a satire either , because even though it is ripe with exaggerations one could view as " satirical " it doesn't have that grounding in reality that satires need . It doesn't even know what it 's satirizing . Then there 's the dialogue , which is little more then the characters screaming obscenities at each other . Example : Character 1 : " F * k you " Character 2 : " Oh yeah , well f * k you " ( repeat ) And the bottom line , the thing that could excuse all the other discretions : There are a lot of movies without plots , without good acting , with morally repulsive characters and obscenity laced dialogue that have been funny and thus , been good . " Whipped " ain't funny . Not for a second . It has no comic skills or timing . The situations are all completely phony , not based in any shred of truth , especially enough to wring laughs out of us . The characters all broadly drawn so they will SEEM relatable to the lowest of the lowest common denominator . Just look at " the marquee scene " , " cult classic " hair gel scene . One of our bumbling anti-heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees Mena ( Peet ) ' s vibrator . For some reason light shines down on it as if he 's found the holy grail . Why Cohen thinks men react this way to vibrators I do not know . While he rubs it on himself , he drops it in the toilet and then attempts to fish it out with his bare hands when , oh my , Mena walks in on him . Oh , my sides . But strangely enough , people actually like this movie . Of course , people also like " Friends " and reality dating shows so I shouldn't be surprised . All of this has a common thread however . " Whipped " is big evidence to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in America that will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex . They will like any show or movie ( or think they like it ) just because it is about dating or relationships . It 's lack of any quality has no baring on these people . Just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs , they are also indoctrinated to blindly lap up anything dating / relationship related to sell them cheap , empty , effortless TV , movies and any number of products . The only consilation will be that when I die , because I saw this movie , I 've got a credit to get 80 minutes of my life back .  
  Difficult to call The Grudge a horror movie . At best it made me slightly jump from surprise at a couple of moments . If one forgets the ( failed ) frightening dimension and looks at other sides of the movie , he is again disappointed . The acting is OK but not great . The story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning , while one is trying to get what 's happening . But toward the end one understands there is not much to understand . " Scary " elements seems sometimes to have been added to the script without reason .. So .. ( yawn ) See this movie it if you have nothing more interesting to do , like cutting the carrots or looking at the clouds .  
  David Lynch 's crude and crudely drawn take on South Park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clichés about suburban middle class families . The father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouth-hole from which are uttered the most horrendous guttural noises , the son and mother are permanently horrified , incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life . A number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series . Lynch is not famous for his comedies ( i . e . On the Air , aspects of Wild at Heart ) , and I am not particularly fond of comedies in general . However , there were a couple of scenes in Dumbland which made me laugh out loud . There are some clever bits of animated cinematography - where Lynch conveys wide ranges of reaction in his characters through a syntactical arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions ( which never really vary in Dumbland ) . I believe Lynch was really trying to give his audience a straight-forward , if disturbing , animated comedy here . Interestingly , he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra-low-brow humor ( i . e . most Will Farrell films ) while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and gross-out humor . While the blend doesn't really work very well here , it is nothing if not Lynchian . Worth seeing by Lynch fans .  
  A terrible amateur movie director ( no , not Todd Sheets ) , his new friend and sister explore a cave . The friend and sister fall in and get rescued . Meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their ' turf ' . Whatever the heck that means . This film and I use the term VERY loosely is so bad that it 's .. well bad . The humor is painfully unfunny , the " action " merely sad . Now I 've seen some atrociously awful ' horror ' films in my time & failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low-budget films , yet I still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this . ONLY for the most hardened maschocists amongst you . but the rest run away FAST ! My Grade : F  
  The first half hour of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters . however all of a sudden everything was happening too quick , a lame reason for Akshey Kumar to date 3 girls , very loud over acting by both Akshey and John Abraham . Neha Dupia was the highlight of the movie , Paresh Rawal did well but not as good as his performance in Hera Pheri . overall this movie was the biggest disappointment the film does no justice to its trailer . save your money and don't watch this movie , watch Hera Pheri and Hungama again ! summarising it : a cheap stage show performance and appearance to the film no story or substance , the plot was extraordinarily non-sense good music by Preetam the man who bought us Dhoom ! keep it up ! movie shot all in one room , new comers ( female cast ) were okay as it was their first film but established actors like Akshey and John totally disappointed an established director like Priyadarshan gives his worst movie ever !  
  I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA . Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel . So , I tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely disappointed . I knew I wouldn't like the movie , but I was not expecting to be perplexed by the use of DV ( digital video ) . The movie would have been tolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere . I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots , but there seemed to be no logical explanation . ( WARNING : THE FOLLOWING MAYBE A SPOILER ! ) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable , but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous . I can only foresee Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing , but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning .  
  Ok , I first saw this movie like at 9:00 on Cinemax a few weeks ago and thought it would be award winning , boy was I 180d on that . This movie bit the big one . I mean , the mother of the monsters shows her true form only at the end of the movie . I 'm going " That 's it ? Why doesn't she show it briefly a little bit more earlier in the movie . " The plot being the mother and son feast on the blood of young women . Wouldn't it be better if they just went on , you know , a killing spree killing like a couple of young women each , then having the sheriff or a cop find out about and get into the old find a way to kill the monsters , save the young woman / women , and have 1 or 2 more people killed in the process ? I think it would be a hell of a lot better that way . It also sucks because the son is the main character and he gets killed first . Why not get rid of the mother first ? Plus , how does she have that strength at the end of the movie when she starts killing people ? She said it herself she was too weak . What the heck was wrong with Stephen this time ? I can never , ever dis the acting on any movie by any actor , after all , they try their best . If it weren't for good acting , I 'd have given this movie a 1/10 . 3/10 .  
  Antonioni , by making this film , had assumed the role of Papa Smurf to all the little long-haired , American , radical student-Smurfs . He had taken them under the guiding protection of his European communist wings , showing appreciation and support for their confused American ways . ( These Smurfs are red and wear blue , not the other way around . ) The radical Smurfs were happy to get the guidance of a wise old man with gray hair who regularly preys to the God of all long-haired Smurfs , Lenin the Communist - another wise old man whose beard made the Smurfs take him even more seriously , for it symbolized something wise , though they did not quite know why they regarded the beard to have this kind of deep effect on them . Castro , another wise bearded man , has often profited from this confusion and exuded magical powers with his beard over his naive overseas admirers . ( Not to mention Che Guevara : that beard has a certain je ne sais pas quoi about it , makes one want to immediately embrace Marx and his lovely , pacifistic teachings ) The film starts with a muddled meeting of radically stupid radical students , who engage in dialogues that truly redefine the word " confused " . As confused as a blind-folded dog falling of a high-story building into a bottomless pit . Suddenly , the movie 's " hero " ( well , Antonioni 's hero ) rises up and says something to his pathetic left-wing peers and then leaves , hoping that this display of " mega-coolness " will improve his James Dean image and vastly increase his chances of getting laid with the best " chicks " in the next mass hippie orgy . Eventually he gets into trouble with cops ( i . e . pigs ) at a rally , and spends the movie under the blue American capitalist skies , looking for freedom Or something like that . Antonioni 's predictable assault on capitalism is not only intellectually hollow , but has ( or had ) nothing new to offer ; it 's just the same old trigger-happy one-dimensional cops , businessmen discussing business deals ( and what 's wrong with that , isn't that how Antonioni 's movies get made ? ) , and endless shots of TV commercials and billboards advertising the oh-so morally decadent products for the abhorrent , selfish , and greedy right-wing rabble-population who thinks of no one but themselves , their families , their work , and their children . Papa Smurf Antonioni , just like his long-haired Smurfs and Smurfettes of the late 60s , failed to notice the most obvious and vital aspect about their silly movement : they were allowed to have their laughable meetings and express their anti-establishment opinions freely within that very establishment , whereas the students in those countries whose left-wing systems they admired , did not ( and still do not ) . By far the greatest irony about the hippies - and Antonioni , naturally , failed to realize this as well ( his judgment being clouded by cocaine-snorting and an excessive intake of LSD ) - is that hippies were ( are ) the garbage-residue of capitalism . This is an incredible irony . Only in a successfully-functioning capitalist system can you find that species called " hippie " ; a spoiled , ungrateful , and selfish bunch of middle and upper-middle class losers . The film itself seems to go on forever . Antonioni takes his sweet time with getting on with it , while including overlong scenes of pointlessness , with a high dullness factor . His attempts at symbolism are annoying and trite . His statements are highly dubious , at best . This film is Antonioni 's way of saying that violent revolution is the solution . And this is what we get from an old , saturated , filthy-rich , fat film-maker who lives in villas and dines in the best French and Italian restaurants . I don't remember seeing any major Western movie about the Tiananmen massacre of thousands of students in China . But when one Western student gets shot for waving Che Guevara 's face into all our faces , we get ten major films about it at once . I suppose this means that a Chinese life is worth a thousand times less than a Western one  at least to the left-wing hypocrites who infest movies . If you 're a Marxist neo-hippy and disliked this awful review , please klick " NO " below .  
  There 's nothing I hate more than self-congratulating pretentiousness . Kevin Smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails for inspiring every white middle-class whiner to make a movie about why they can't get laid . I don't really mind inexperience and low-budget productions but when the writing is this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes . The money put into this could 've gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like John Gulager . If you watch Project Greenlight you 'll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system . Anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that doesn't manage to say anything really , at all . When will we be saved from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world ? The revolution can't come soon enough . Go watch a real first time effort by buying Desperado or searching out Friends With Benefits . Thank you and good day .  
  it aint bad , but it aint good . it is just entertaining . as a comedy which it is supposed to be , it 's dreadful . not many laughs at all as every joke in the movie has been done a million times before . it 's a shame as all the actors in the film are great usually , but none of them really do much . and the ending sucks .  
  The story by Norman Maclean is a masterwork ; Redford 's film is a mediocrity . He adds banal scenes of the Maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story . The cipher , Brad Pitt , trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean , a genius outdoors , proves either risible or depressing , depending on what the original story meant to you . Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful . Also , Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine , as men were once expected to be . None of the women make an impression in the film , which is regrettable , because Maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear , even poetic .  
  Stephen J . Cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and dabble in horror . The result , " Dead Above Ground " , is an abysmal piece of junk . Now , had I noticed his name in association with THIS particular film I 'd have put it back but no , I didn't have my glasses on and therefore I missed it , damn , I really do need to bring those with me while video shopping . First question would be , who the heck is the target audience for this ? It 's almost like a " scary " kids movie , but then again there 's topless babes and some gore and some bad words spouted here and there . The main characters are so cute that you want to see someone , anyone , go after them with farm implements of SOME kind . Seems that a guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past , a child-murdering witch that collected children 's teeth lived there . Probably something the real estate agent failed to mention . Of course now in the modern day there 's a little girls ghost around to warn the real-live little girl that now lives there that something bad is going to happen . It does , and there 's also two Bubbas that were squatting on that property when the new owner took over so they 're out for revenge too . This whole thing has the feel of some made-for-cable junk that 's for the kids at Halloween except for , of course , the things that aren't suitable for little kids , so not only is this mediocre , it 's confused , too . A big boo and hiss to Anchor Bay for putting this out too , considering their usual track record with fine releases this is a new low . The UK gets a Phantasm Box Set , we get " The Tooth Fairy " . Hardly seems fair . 1 out of 10 , absolute garbage .  
  Mario Van Peebles pops up for less than a five second cameo . Glenn Plummer shows up a little longer but its a ladies show all the way . Stacey Dash and Lisa Raye have been in better projects . Bobby Brown leers and mugs through his little time on screen . This is how it was pitched .. Five tough women shootin ' and lovin ' in the Wild Wild West . Four black and one Asian . Oh and Lil ' Kim is a tough talking ' heartbreaker and Marie Matiko can bring in the pacific rim market . We can shoot it for less than 15 million . Straight to video and we 'll double but more likely triple our dollars . Greenlight that puppy . You got it boss .  
  To be completely honest , I haven't seen that many western films but I 've seen enough to know what a good one is . This by far the worst western on the planet today . First off there black people in the wild west ? Come on ! Who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly , no no , completely retarded ! Secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns . Thirdly whats with the Asian chick speaking perfect English ? If the setting is western , Asia isn't where your going . Finally , the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning . Now don't get me wrong I 'm not racist or white either so don't get ticked after reading this but this movie , this movie is the worst presentation of black people I have ever seen !  
  I remember loving this show when I was a kid . I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I 've seen . It was ultra high-tech for it 's time . It could repel enemy fire , do all sorts of acrobatics in the air , and take down nearly anything in it 's way . Now I go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is . The casts members are hardly compelling , there are a lot of cheesy moments , and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking . And nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of grainy low quality stock footage . Lot of the footages appear to date from the Vietnam War era . Airwolf has basically the same theme as Knight Rider , except the crime-fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car . After watching a few episodes , I found myself utterly bored . I do , however , love the theme music .  
  The perfect murder is foiled when a wife ( played by Mary Ellen Trainor , once the wife to director Robert Zemeckis , who helmed this episode ) , who murders her husband with a poker , has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside .. an escaped insane madman dressed in a Santa Claus suit ( played by a deviously hideous Larry Drake ) . She fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband 's corpse . She decides to use an ax , once she downs the Santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman 's head , to frame the killer for her husband 's murder . Santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman 's daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child . This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT just recycles tired material involving the old " Santa kills " theme while also adding the oft-used ( add nauseum ) woman murders her husband for a man she's been cheating with routine . It 's essentially Trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac . There 's nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions . Not one of the show 's highlights .  
  Oh my god . oh my god , i cant get over this movie . It was god-awful . horrible , terrible ! Don't even waste your money to buy it in the 99 cent bin . No , avoid it at all costs I 'm warning you ! It was the worst movie I 've ever seen . In my life . In my life ! First of all , G-girl ? Are you kidding me . Get real that sounds like some kind of new Barbie doll .. Super Women ? Are you kidding me . It was so fake fake fake fake . The people of the town didn't even seem to care that there was a flying blonde just zooming her way around the town saving a fire .. Ohh big ! Jesus , was it just me or did this movie seem offensive ? I guess what you need to be a super hero is a couple of double D 's , blonde flowing hair , no glasses and a leather skin tight suit ? ! If it was trying to be romantic .. than .. god , i don't know . It was horrid , if love means taking some one to an art show and than having sex in a bed AND in the air .. than they totally had love ! It was pathetic , everything went too fast . First that guy was single , than he was dating G-girl .. than they broke up than he dated that Hannah girl .. and .. it just goes on . I have to say this movie made me wonder .. How the hell did they get this in theaters ? ! Avoid this movie at all costs .  
  Well I must say this is probably the worst film I have seen this year ! The jokes were extremely crude ( wasn't expecting it from as PG movie ) ( Rated PG in Canada ) and they weren't funny ! With this great cast I at least expected some good acting but I didn't even get that . I am a huge Rainn Wilson fan and this is the first time I was extremely disappointed by his performance . Neither Luke Wilosn or Uma Thurman 's characters are the least bit likable and i really could have cared less what happened to either of them . I didn't expect this at all as in the past I have really liked other movies by this director ( Six Days , Seven Nights for example ) This movie was NOT worth the $ 10 it cost me and i strongly encourage you not to see this movie . I guarantee that you will be like me begging for this movie to be over .  
  I went to see this film yesterday and although i didn't have high hopes for this film , I was still bitterly disappointed ! I actually cant believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film .. it was THAT bad ! The storyline was disgraceful and the acting was terrible ( even though it had big names such as Uma Thurman in it ) . This film heavily relied on its special effects .. but they personally had no effect on me . I honestly wished id never watched it and I strongly warn everyone against seeing this film . It is a total waste of money and you 'll only end up being disappointed afterwards . My advice is to save your money , go shopping , treat yourself , just don't go and see this film .. You 'll live to regret it lol !  
  Horrible film with bits of the Ramones strewn about . Your worse than average 1970 's / 80 's comedy format of the cool kids taking over the school with some whimsical plan . This movie is terrible . The plot consists of a girl who enjoys the Ramones and a school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration . Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero starring Guitar Wolf if you want an entertaining B movie . Terrible acting , terrible writing , terrible plot with the stamp of approval of the Ramones who probably needed some money quick so they said yes to this movie . That is the only logical thing I can think of because this movie blows .  
  This film concerns the story of Eddy as mentioned in the title and his homecoming to old friends in a seaside community . The plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that Eddy left as a means to deal with death of a friend in which he feels in some way responsible . But this is inconsequential , as the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized . Screenplays not always need be ' chatty ' , but they should at least assist the development of the story . Here one line attempts such as " he just took off " or " I know you don't have love in heart " just do fully evoke something worth the audience 's time . Also whenever the writer feels at a loss to where to go to next he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through fields to some indie mood music . Talk about trying to hard . If you are interested in a good film , the type that gives quality and substance over just style then this is not the film for you .  
  If you are under the age of 6 or 7 , then you 're going to really enjoy this movie . My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she watches it . As an adult , I can't stand it ! I 'm all up for sequels .. when they have a decent storyline . But this is nowhere near up to standard . Please forgive me for slating what is after all a kid 's film , but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much , you 'll understand why . My daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her . I 've given this film 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained .  
  this film tries to be immensely clever , and Tarantino-like before you try that though , you need solid filmic fundamentals . these include good sound , editing , set design etc .. lets talk about the sound in this movie . absolutely atrocious . i have never been more distracted by a sound track , ever and before we talk about low budget , film made in Chile etc .. lets bear in mind that desent sound these days is far more achievable than it ever has been . anywhere . and more info on technique is available then ever before the sound in this movie is plain bad . the foley in particular is out of place and inappropriate throughout , the atmos is equally terrible . i heard at least four loud clicks during the movie , which are the result of poor sound editing . the sound inside cars is awful , the sound of car doors closing is awful . the sound of the lady singing is wrong . foley is either overboard , or simply not there like the sound person just got bored and gave up . the spaces are wrong . everything about it is wrong and yet , not letting limitations of creativity get in the way , at the same time the movie tries boldly to be clever . for example the sound of the aquarium is used in the following street scene . we hear sound when we 're not supposed to . sound edits precede visual cuts . every trick in the book is used , and yet the foundations are just not there editing-wise we have scenes using heavy jump cuts , we have tinkering around with the time line etc etc etc , yawn . all of these techniques are imitated to a splendidly low standard overall the mix is crap , the sound is crap . and so , the film is crap . how can a movie with so many fundamental flaws be considered for awards and high praise ? Chile 's cinematic new wave ? the best creative output that Chile has to offer ? i hope not , and i think not . my theory is that Chile 's more selective and better talent avoided this film like the plague maybe due to its risqué content . equally , the film has likely received so much unwarranted critical acclaim from so called ' world-cinema ' enthusiasts for the same grubby reasons . they likely revel in it 's trashiness . of course film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality this film is rubbish . it 's all mouth and no trousers and is never deserving of a 6.8 rating . the film has all the production quality of a cheap Tarantino , new wave inspired porno !  
  I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart . After seeing it , I might just return to the store and try to get my money back ! The only reason I gave the movie a 2 and not a 1 is that the story has a few novel story elements , though it really never rises to the level of being interesting . This film has all the earmarks of being a made for the drive-in theaters market-ultra-low budget , amateurish acting and a liberal dose of sex ( for an early 60s film ) . In fact , I wonder if perhaps the only reason the film was made was to make a fast buck AND because someone knew some strippers they could use as extras . The film is about a wacko doctor who wants to transplant his girlfriend 's severed head onto the body of an unsuspecting donor . Most of the potential donors are skanky strippers or a model-whose only real purpose in the film is to titillate as they remove most of their clothes . However , they keep too much on to make the movie even worth watching for the naughty bits and the film isn't quite awful enough to merit watching by bad film buffs .  
  This type of plot really does have a lot of potential , but it was butchered here . Honestly , I sensed the cheese element in the beginning , but I thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing . Whoa , I was wrong ! So mad scientist makes a monster , wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them , but of course they escape . After that , it 's really bad . I should 've counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage , but I most likely would have lost count . Pan down to the blood dripping from severed leg to show us how the shark-man finds the folks . I hate being spoon-fed every aspect of a horror film . Oh , and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark-man and trudging around a jungle-esqe island , there 's nothing more cheerful than a middle-aged man reciting Shakespeare .. This is one where you 'll find yourself rooting for the monster .. if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick .  
  Not a ` woman film ' but film for the gang . One of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman . Director Andy McKay simply doesn't know woman . Peaks of bad taste , American Pie 's humor style , crude story , no sense , groundless story , refuted characters . Vulgar fantasies came to life on screen . Insulting and definitely not funny . I wonder how three good actresses accepted to take part in it .  
  Well , I hate hollywood , but love cinema so i have to watch these cruddy movies in theaters . And , I was hoping Vanilla Sky would be good . i was hoping that they would either keep the original " Open Your Eyes " exactly the same , or they would make it their own . Well , it happened to be a little bit of both , and it sucked . It started out good . I love Radiohead . I wish there was more of that . But by the end we are listening to Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys . Talk about a wide range of suck between . They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others , but why oh why did they have to blare GV during the climax . It was more annoying than confusing or blatant . Especially when it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT . At least put some meaning behind the songs . Kid A = primary . Whatever . He also did a bang up job with the club scene . That was cool . Otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance . As if audiences would get the movie . The ones that would get it read subtitles , and the rest won't . Its as simple as that . The motivations got all screwed up . I didn't comprehend the Diaz motivations ( hadn't they done the Chicken Soup night before ? ) and some of the others . And I hate Kurt Russell . Stay overboard . Tom Cruise can't act ( especially in these types of movie [ i . e . Eyes Wide Shut ] ) . And the elevator . I get it . Anyways they tried improving the original with a crappy american rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good film print and glossy processing and it would have helped if crowe hadn't screwed it up . 2/10 Major disappointment .  
  A remake of Alejandro Amenabar 's Abre los Ojos , but this time with a living , breathing mask as a lead . For the dubious advantage of an English sound track , we endure Tom Cruise 's soulless performance , as usual , with zero depth . Yes , the character is identified with his persona , but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest . His empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz . There is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body language means . Cruise 's masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor . Do see the 1997 original Amenabar Open Your Eyes !  
  does anyone think that this show actually helps some people , or does it only anger the people who watch it ? when i am flipping through the channels and come upon this show i half to watch out of morbid curiosity . i understand that pat Roberson is not all together . what i do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listening to what he has to say . pat Roberson is of little consequence . he is an old man who thinks in an old way . fear of damnation no longer has the same affects as it once did ( thank god ) . now if someone will please answer my question i will be dodging lightning bolts for the rest of eternity .  
  I have no idea how anyone managed to stay awake during this show . The acting was ham-fisted and amateur , the story was old news , and plot development ( or lack thereof ) invariably had my eyelids sagging less than halfway through each episode . That 's about all there is to say of it , because it genuinely lacked substance of any kind . How can you people like crap like this ? It 's freaking stupid , it 's an insult to your intelligence . I don't even know how to further explain it .. It 's as if some of you will stare mindlessly at junk like this solely because you like the way some of the actors look , or because , for whatever crazy reason , you haven't seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times before . I just .. forget it . This show sucked , and thankfully it 's gone forever . I wish they 'd get to work on demolishing The O.C. once and for all .  
  From a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer , bad acting ( even Peter Falk can't find his way ) " Finding John Christmas " is better left lost . Ms . Bertinelli 's performance is without depth or emotion as are her co-stars , William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as love interest Noah . Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro , the daughter of single dad Noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing . But who can blame them with material like this . Michael J . Murray 's script is juvenile at best . Each year at this time I search the TV guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen . Films like " Miracle on 34th Street " , Ernst Lubitsch 's delightful " The shop around the corner " and , of course the 1951 version of " Scrooge " . There 's Frank Capra 's classics " It 's a wonderful life " and " Meet John Doe " . Hey , forget the classics . What about " Home Alone " or " Home for the Holidays " with Holly Hunter and a great performance by Robert Downey Jr . ? My present to you is by way of advice . Your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding " Finding John Christmas " . Merry Christmas !  
  Well , I 'll start by admitting I 'm not a John Ford fan . ( I watched " The Informer " only because I 'm trying to work my way through a list of the " greats . " ) So if you are , just move along , ' cause you 're not going to agree with me . What an overwrought and dated piece of silliness this is ! I will say that there is a good idea for a movie here ( it made me think about how few films there are about the Irish Revolution ) but , as usual , Ford is determined to bury it under over-acting and cheap sentiment . I suppose it 's somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the less-than-seamless transition that was being made from the silents to the " talkies " - the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue . ( Of course , title cards would prevent Ford from restating every bit of emotion six times . ) What dialogue there is usually has a " They 're always after me Lucky Charms ! " quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an Irish accent . Of course , as bad as they are , the accents are helpful in reminding us we 're in Ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some German expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over . ( It feels as if , with an eagle eye , you might see some villagers off to torch Dr . Frankenstein in the background . ) Techniques change . Tastes change . So I won't go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day . But it 's not one of the classics that hold up - more just " fair warning " about the kind of over-simplified malarkey to which Ford was going to devote his career .  
  Hello , can anybody hear me ? I don't know why you came to this page , but if you 're a fellow viewer of this movie : join the fanclub ! This movie was so unbelievably bad I couldn't stop laughing when I saw it . I think it 's a must see , it 's bad in a nice way . Every cliche ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here . I 'm afraid it 's very hard to get a copy of this movie , but it should be in the top 10 of worst movies ever made .  
  When I first saw this film , I thought it should have come from the children 's section - It 's very fun and at times humorous , and is actually quite a good story , but it severely lacks the " romantic chemistry " that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are capable of delivering . I must note that Walter Matthau is perfect for the part of Albert Einstein , and his performance is extraordinary , but that 's the sole exception . This film appears a bit forced , the directing lacks substance , and oh yeah .. the music is ridiculously awful , it didn't put me in a very good mood . But if you are not expecting a smart , well-crafted comedy / romance tale , then this certainly can be entertaining , like I said .. it should be in the children 's section . Einstein and his buddies are a good relief from Tim Robbins ' boring , almost tense quest to steal Meg Ryan 's heart . A very conflicting film , but as long as it 's not taken seriously this can be an alright movie .  
  What an awful movie ! The Idea of robots fighting each other is cool , but the storyline is ridiculous , real human action laughable , acting non-existent and special effects ( on which , this type of movie must depend ) are archaic . I thought it must have been made around ' 80-'84 and was amazed to see it was from 1990 . That 's 5 years after Aliens ! OK , lots of people said it was good considering the low budget , but I just think ' what 's the point ? ' . it looks totally unbelievable . I wouldn't mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely re-written story because I still like the idea of huge robots beating crap out of each other .  
  This sequel is thoroughly uneven , incoherent and rambling in " plot " ( if there really is one ) and tries too damned hard to be modern ( ridiculous , out of period and character 21 st century style songs predominate ) and cute ( yawn : there are too many manufactured , belaboured jokes with animals . ) The actors in his film are secondary to the juvenile plot . Even Glenn Close ( and she is normally very good ) sweeps through this film , parodying herself as the original De Ville and the lead from Sunset Boulevard ! It 's a film that isn't even good to look at . This is a very good example of a bad and pointless sequel . Even Basic Instinct 2 had a plot , characterisation and acceptable acting . This doesn't . It is bad .  
  A sequel to ( actually a remake of ) Disney 's 1996 live-action remake of 101 Dalmations . Cruella deVil ( Glenn Close ) is released from prison after being " cured " of her obsession with fur by a psychologist named Dr . Pavlov ( ugh ! ) . But the " cure " is broken when Cruella hears the toll of Big Ben , and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hides . This movie is bad on so many levels , starting with the fact that it 's a " Thanksgiving family schlock " movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the Disney marketing machine . Glenn Close over over over over acts as Cruella . With all that she had to put up with in this movie - the lame script , the endless makeup , getting baked in a cake at the end - I hope they gave her an extremely-large paycheck . ( Speaking of which , where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory , a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line , and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building - as you do in the climax of this film ? ) Of course , the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs . They serve as the " Macaulay Culkin 's " of this movie , pulling all the stupid " Home Alone " gags on the villains . ( Biting them in the crotch , running over their hands with luggage carts , squirting them with icing , etc . , etc . , etc . , ad nauseum . ) I have to admit , the dogs were fairly good actors - much better than the humans . Gerard Depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked-out French furrier . The two human " dog lovers " - rehashed from the earlier film , but with different actors - are completely boring . When they have a spaghetti dinner at an Italian restaurant , the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers , and their dogs at home , watching the dinner scene from " Lady and the Tramp . " I thought to myself , " Oh please , don't go there ! " I half-expected the humans to do a satire on the " Lady and the Tramp " dinner scene - as Charlie Sheen did in " Hot Shots : Part Deux " - doing the " spaghetti strand kiss , " pushing the meatball with his nose , etc . And don't get me started on the annoying parrot with Eric Idle 's voice . The costumes were nominated for an Oscar , and the costumes in the movie * are * good . But they are the only good thing in the movie . The rest of it is unbearable dreck .  
  Nothing positive to say . Meandering nonsense , huffing and puffing with a " message " . New Russian ( post-Soviet ) films can be very good ( Cuckoo comes to mind ) , yet many have the bouquet of cardboard and the aftertaste of asbestos ( Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example ) . This is a " dozor " type of emptiness . Acting would be horrible if not for the saving grace of utterly unappealing direction and incompetent editing that sometimes is so awful that it distracts from the impotence of the actors . Special award to the cameraman for making sure that every shot is shaky ( would someone please realize that Blair Witch has had its 15 seconds of undeserved fame ? ) and takes are geared towards attention-deficit pre-teens who subside on CounterStrike and masturbation . The female lead poses and tries to look seductive too often , male antihero need a diction coach ( although genetics aren't bad : rather expressive eyes . ) One ( middle ) finger for this irrelevant pile of non-art . Anyone who reviews this positively better be a ( distant ) cousin of the " auteurs " .  
  Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain . He is a kind of bad showman who can make you feel sick .. Very embarrassing . Nacho had made some commercials in TV , I remember one in which Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid ( the commercial was about a Mc Carney CD collection ) . This little movie is like a Nacho 's commercial : bad storyline , bad directing , and awful performances . I can't believe that a disgusting movie like this was in The Kodak Theater . Poor Oscar .. Nacho could made this movie because of his wife , the producer of this 7:35 , a woman very well connected with Spanish TV business men .  
  Singleton has some serious issues he has to come to grips with . I get the feeling that he thinks he is pretty smart ; however , this movie is almost comically transparent and self righteous . In addition , there are a bunch of " might-makes-right " messages like when our local Nazi jerks get beat up . I mean , who in their right mind is going to root for a bunch of Nazi jerks ? However , he way Singleton portrays the " fight " is downright silly and seems to be designed to show us more the superior fighting qualities of the black protagonists than anything else . There is another " bad guy " ( in reality a drunken frat boy ) who rapes one of the movie 's protagonists . In this instance , I think that Singleton actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved asks the frat boy to use a condom and he either does not have one or does not want to use one . In any event , he does not accede to her demands that he stop and he proceeds to have intercourse despite her pleas . I think that this type of rape is all too common and in fact many uniformed people refuse to accept the fact that it is even a rape . Well , no means no , this is a rape , which probably occurs a lot in Universities across the country . Having established the rape , how does Singleton deal with it ? When the frat boy tries to call the woman , her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone , at which point the frat boy calls the roommate a " black bitch . " The aggrieved roommate appears to appeal to a counsel of Ice Cube , et al , who then proceed to physically humiliate and abuse the frat boy into repeated and prolonged " apologies " to roommate for his racist remarks ; however the ( apparently in Singleton 's mind ) lesser crime of rape is not mentioned . Again , no one really should feel sorry for the frat boy ; however , Singleton seems to be sending a dual message that a racist comment is a greater offense then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerks . What is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but Singleton , while no doubt a talented director , does not appear to have the maturity or depth to pull of something of this magnitude .  
  Higher Learning says its OK for blacks to torment white people because they 're all oppressors . most blacks in this movie are portrayed as ignorant savages . Stunning that this is supposed to be a positive movie about race . Incompetent acting , direction , and production values all contribute to this toothache of a flick . An appalling piece of trash . the perpetrators of this dreck should be ashamed .

  I was dreading taking my nephews to this movie , as I didn't think it was going to be well done . The kids , ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it , so I caved . I must admit that it was not nearly as bad as I had thought , but was still a far cry from the book . The movie seemed right on with the 10 year old 's understanding and sense of humor . I found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place . I eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies don't show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the " silly " or " stupid " choices .  
  Well , because I 'm a musician I thought , maybe I 'll check this movie out on TMC , nothing else good on . One of the worst mistakes of my life so far , and it 's only half done . I seriously thought it was one of those soft core movies with crappy plot and crappy acting , crappy filming and crappy effects . But nope , I don't even get the pleasure of that . Even the " musicians " weren't very good . I was hoping for maybe some laughs , but I wasn't sure if they were attempting to throw in one-liners or not . But now I have to sit here and watch the rest just until Pulp Fiction starts . Or maybe something better . And now i get to sit here typing until i have 10 lines  
  The story at the outset is interesting : slavery in the ( late ) 20th century from west Africa to the Arab Middle East . The problem with it is that it intentionally castigates two of director Richard Fleisher 's favorite enemies : Arabs and Germans . To make us believe that very Arab-looking men would be free to roam around and easily catch Blacks in West Africa is as believable as Whites hunting for slaves in " Roots " . Obviously both trades are / were run by locals and involve ( d ) much more sophisticated networks . While Arab countries are complicit in today 's child and sex slave trade , Israel is one of the worst violators according to Amnesty International . So why only point out Arabs and then choose a German as the only European buyer ? It 's obvious bias and hatred of those people by a Jewish director . The acting is above average , especially by Peter Ustinov ( Suleiman ) and Kabir Bedi ( Malik ) . Michael Caine ( Dr . Linderby ) is good as always .  
  I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it 's better than Caine believes , although it 's not much cop . Britain 's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role , which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing . Rex Harrison seems even less bothered , perhaps unsurprisingly , as his character is very poorly written . William Holden is better , but his screen time is fleeting and , again , his character is not well scripted . Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen , but is given very little to do , the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story . Ustinov steals the show , but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film 's serious tone . The music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos ( his career has been based on this for decades now ) . Richard Fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively , he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director , and this is one of his weaker movies .  
  I 've now watched all four Bo Derek vehicles directed by her husband , John ; all are quite terrible , of course , but this is certainly the pits . Featuring the usual flimsy plot , bad scripting  by the director , naturally  and acting , not to mention gratuitous nudity by the star , it deals with her losing much older husband Anthony Quinn ( she accepts his shotgun suicide by saying he had always admired Hemingway ! ) but who continues to appear and talk to her . In fact , he wants to come back in another , younger bodybut actually does so only in the very last scene ! Derek is lovely as always , and still playing naïve ( ! )  especially during a muddled mid-section which has her pursued by a hired killer at a spa . Quinn , too , is typically larger-than-life ( read : hammy ) here , but this easily constitutes his nadir ; besides , for much of the duration , he acts from behind a piece of shiny plastic ( presumably suggesting his being in some sort of limbo ) ! His ' replacement ' , then , is obviously a handsome-looking stud who hasn't a lick of talent or even personality . Also featured in the cast are Hollywood veterans Don Murray ( as Quinn 's best friend and Bo 's business consultant ) and Julie Newmar ( as Quinn 's guardian angel in the afterlife )  plus a surprising cameo appearance by billionaire Donald Trump ( who presumably needed this on his resume ' ) ! It also goes without saying that John Derek was his own cinematographer on the film , that the end credits are filled with useless ( and corny ) expressions of gratitude to the many people who lent a helping hand , and that GHOSTS CAN'T DO IT swept the board at the 1990 Razzie Awards !  
  Generally I don't do minus 's and if this site could i would give this movie -3 out of 10 meaning I really hated this movie . I thought Uwe Boll 's alone in the dark was the worst i 've seen yet but at least i gave it a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion ( Stephen Dorff shooting at nothing made me laugh so i boosted the ratings a bit ) . Hell if it was if compared to bloodrayne , Bloodrayne would win a Oscar for best movie if they were competing . Now to the plot , this movie is about the BTK killer which is fine but they 've could have done better . The start looked OK but that 's it I had to fast forward most of it because the death 's where boring . I like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths . I 'm not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this . Sorry for rambling but there 's nothing good to say about it , because it looks like someone took a camcorder and film this .. this .. thing of disaster . Uwe Boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cake . Well sorry i couldn't explain the plot ( if there was one ) but that was the best i could . Now if you don't mind i 'm going to crawl into a corner and move back and forth and reminding me of how bad this movie scared me for life .. OK not for life  
  By my " Kool-Aid drinkers " remark , I mean that these are such devoted fans of the man Pavarotti that they make no attempt to objectively rate this film . Giving this a 10 is akin to giving Wally Cox the award for Mr . Universe or putting a velvet Elvis painting in the Louvre ! When this film debuted , I remember the savage reviews with headlines such as " No , Giorgio " and some said it was among the worst films ever made . This is definitely overstating it as well . While bad and far from a great work of art , there was a lot to like about the film and the movie 's biggest deficit was not the acting of Pavarotti nor his girth . Believe it or not , the brunt of the blame rests solely on the shoulders of the writers ( who , I believe , were chimps ) . It is rare to see a movie with such clichéd dialog or goofy scenes like the food fight , but even they aren't the heart of the problem . The problem is that the writers intend for the audience to care about a " romance " that consists of a horny married middle-aged man and a seemingly desperate lady . Perhaps European audiences might be more forgiving of this , but in the United States in 1982 or today , such a romance seems sleazy and selfish-especially when Pavarotti tells Harrold that he loves his wife and " this is just fun " . Wow , talk about romantic dialog ! Sadly , if they had just changed the script a little bit and made Pavarotti a widower or perhaps had his wife be like the wife from a couple classic Hollywood films , such as from ALL THIS AND HEAVEN , TOO or THE SUSPECT ( where the wife was so vile and unlikable you could forgive the husband having an affair or even killing her ) . Instead , she 's the loving mother of two kids who waits patiently at home while her egotistical hubby beds tarts right and left-as Pavarotti admits to having had many affairs before meeting Harrold . Sadly , even the gorgeous music of Pavarotti couldn't save this film . Towards the end of the film , there are some amazing scenes in New York where the set is just incredible and Pavarotti 's singing transcendent . For that reason , I think the movie at least deserves a 3 . I really wanted to like the film more , but it was a truly bad film-though not quite as rotten as you might have heard . Sadly , from what I have read , this film might be a case of art imitating life , as Pavarotti 's own life later had some parallels to this film , though this isn't exactly the forum to discuss this in detail .  
  I hadn't heard of this film until I read an article about it on the Unknown Movies website , which made me curious . As a cartoonist and illustrator myself , I 'm an admirer of Richard Williams 's work - I rate Ziggy 's Gift as one of the finest Christmas specials of all time , and even though Who Framed Roger Rabbit stopped being one of my favourite films when I got past the age of sixteen , I still have the highest of regard for the amount of work , care and attention to detail that went into creating the visuals - but it seems the man has his faults , most notably a propensity for going over budget and over schedule , and this film is a testament of just how far wrong even a super-talented individual like Williams can go , given the right circumstances . Raggedy Ann and Andy is a strange confection that tries to be weird and experimental and off the wall within the confines of a children 's cartoon . It tries also to be a musical . It tries to be a thousand and one other things as well - is it a freakout ? Is it a mind-blower ? Is it a paean to the innocence of childhood imagination ? - until it finally collapses under the weight of its own limitless ambitions and aspirations . It 's beautifully animated , for the most part , though the bland backgrounds could have used a little more attention , but even that doesn't count for much when you 're confronted with the hallucinogenic absurdity that constitutes much of the ' action ' here . There are a number of problems with the film , but let 's start with Raggedy Ann and Andy themselves . They 're the stars of the show , yet they have no personalities . Actually , we get the message that Andy is a wannabe tough guy ( " I 'm no girl 's toy " , he sings ) and that Ann has a unique perspective on things because her owner , a little girl called Marcella , carries her upside down , but that 's all we get to find out about these dull-as-mud characters because the overwhelming weirdness of this film kicks in not long after . I use the word " weirdness " advisedly , because some weird films can be hugely entertaining , but this is just flat-out strange . The toys and dolls in the playroom are supposed to be cute and lovable , but they 're actually bizarre and disturbing . The two marionettes who do and say everything in sync are a prime example of this . But even they 're relatively normal compared to the constantly sneezing pirate captain , whose moustache becomes erect and whose groin visibly swells when he first catches sight of a glamorous French doll . Yes , this is supposed to be a children 's film ! Then there 's the music , none of which is memorable , and all of which is sung by actors who can't sing . And to add insult to injury , there 's a lot of singing in this film . When Ann and Andy finally make it out of the playroom , the first thing they do is sing a LONG number in the woods about how scared they are , about how they 'll always have each other and .. yes , we get the message . This seems to go on forever , but at least it brings some semblance of normality back to the film . Not for long , though , because the Camel with the wrinkled knees leads us into a bizarre world where everything looks like it 's made from worn and faded denim , and - bad enough that he 's clearly a paranoid schizophrenic - he also starts hallucinating . But this is nothing compared to the scenes that follow . The Greedy , a living , breathing . belching , farting , constantly eating pool of taffy , is so trippy , creepy and ultimately disturbing , you 'll hardly believe what you 're seeing - this is as close to a drug-free psychedelic experience as I 've ever seen on film . Then , after a l o n g time spent with the Greedy , along comes the psychotic Sir Leonard Looney and his master King KooKoo , whose throne resembles a urinal . I can't believe I 'm actually writing a capsule description of a real film here - I just had to rub my eyes and remind myself that I 'm not blogging about an overwhelmingly whacked-out nightmare I had . Part of the sequence in Looney Land resembles one of the old Winsor McCay / Little Nemo cartoons , for no good reason other than somebody felt like doing it , probably . All this would be fine if there was some kind of rhyme or reason behind it , but there isn't . These scenes are just strange , and very , very long . Surrealism only works when there 's a strong idea behind it , or takes place against some semblance of reality . But NOTHING in these scenes points towards any kind of reality . Take away this element , and you 're left with pure self indulgence . As the final scenes unravel , even the animation begins to look less impressive ( the pirate ship , ludicrously detailed , jerks about on the water in a manner that suggests some of the cels went missing during the production ) and there 's a non-event of an ending that simply suggests money ran out . Even at a meagre 86 minutes in length , the film feels like a never-ending ordeal , and it 's understandable why it flopped on its original release . Animation buffs will probably scratch their heads and wonder just how Williams managed to flub this one so spectacularly , but he did , and there 's nothing anyone can do about it .  
  From watching only the trailer to Theodore Rex , you would think this is a bad buddy cop comedy with Whoopi Goldberg and a guy in a dinosaur costume . That is true , but this is mostly a futuristic story , which looks a lot like Batman Forever with it 's direction style and weird character designs . It was mismarketed , and should have been marketed as a futuristic tale , instead of just a lame cop comedy . Whether or not this movie is mismarketed , it 's still a horrible movie . In the future , dinosaurs have been brought back to life through amazing technology , and they talk and walk around like humans . Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously , but after a dinosaur is murdered , he 's given the case to work on , but he has to be partners with the toughest cop of them all , Katie Coltrane ( Whoopi Goldberg ) . It 's up to this mismatched duo to solve the murder , and it 's up to the audience to stay awake long enough to make it through this piece of crud . Teddy starts the picture as a normal acting character , but by the end he is unbearable to listen to . For some reason along with being a detective , he 's also a bad comedian and a bad impersonator . He does imitations of famous people and accents , and has some truly awful lines . Whoopi blames him for farting and he says , " It 's not my butt trumpet ! " Wow ! What a puerile , immature line , even for a kid 's movie of this caliber . Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone . I was hoping Teddy would bite her head off the entire length of the film . This movie never knew what it wanted to be . When the futuristic scenes and action occur , there is no comedy or humor . In any non-action scenes , the characters try to be as funny as they can , which just results in nonstop straight faced boredome . The action scenes don't work as they 're too weird and not violent enough , and as stated earlier , the comedy is just a bunch of massacred jokes . Nothing ever works here . Having a dinosaur / human detective duo seems like a pretty original movie , if nothing else . Nope ! This movie is a huge rip-off of Who Framed Roger Rabbit . Just replace dinosaurs with cartoons , and set it in the future , and it 's the exact same plot . A man is killed , a dinosaur is killed . A dinosaur and detective solve the murder , a toon and detective solve the murder . The bad guys in Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and weasels . The bad guys here are a guy who sounds like Christopher Lloyd and guys who act just like the weasels . The club scene in Roger Rabbit where Jessica Rabbit walks down the stage is imitated with dinosaurs . This is a huge rip-off of a much better movie ! Overall , this is a bad movie , not even deserving of it 's straight to VHS stature . My rating : 1/2 out of * . 90 mins . PG for mild violence , language and crude humor .  
  Despite the high ratings given to this film by IMDB users , this is nothing more than your typical girl with a bad childhood obsessively stalks married man film . The attractive Justine Priestly 's brief nude scenes may attract voyeurs , but the film is hackneyed tripe . * 1/2 out of *  
  Batman Mystery of the Batwoman , is , in a word , stale . The plot goes that a mysterious female vigilante ( " Batwoman " ) is intruding on Batman 's turf , and while Batman is trying to combat a Penguin / Bane / Rupert Thorne threesome , he 's trying to figure out who the mysterious Batwoman is . There is nothing strikingly wrong about this , but there is nothing really special about it either , noting really made it stick out . Mask of the Phantasm had Bruce 's long lost love re surface and mess with his head . Subzero was a major event in the life of Mr Freeze . Even the Batman Beyond movie spin off , Return of the Joker , dug deep with the characters involved . But Mystery of the Batwoman had some minor subplots , a lot of formula topped off by a mediocre setpiece on a cruise boat . Frankly , this thing is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight , lacking the punch and bite that the Animated Series had in it 's prime .  
  The dubbing / translation in this movie is downright hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick . I haven't laughed so hard in my life as I just did watching Zombi 3 ( and I 've seen some really bad dubbing in my life , believe me ) . Seriously , the filmmakers could re-edit this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars . It 's just that funny . But .. If falling off your couch laughing at the dubbing in a Fulci zombie movie isn't your cup of tea , then AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS .  
  Another FRIDAY THE 13TH ripoff , even featuring some of its music ! A group of young adults get together for a small high school reunion and start getting slaughtered a la Jason Voorhees . Could it be that nerd they used to torment in school ? Routine slash-fest is fun for fans of the genre , and contains the usual T & A quota for films if its ilk . The ending is a bit more imaginative than your standard slasher . MPAA : Rated for violence / gore , language , sexuality , nudity , and some drug content .  
  I was very excited about this film when I first saw the previews . Normally I see a preview this good and I buy the film outright . Something told me to .. you know watch it first . I 'm glad I did . Keira Knightley ruined all future films for me with this role . In the 2nd Pirates movie when it came out I went to see it . All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more for it . I think that had to do with her hair and having to cut it short for Domino . Domino who ? Who is Domino Harvey ? I still don't really know or care . I don't know who she was in real life or who she was in this film . I didn't care about her character and even Keira getting partically naked didn't make it worth the movie . The direction was definitely lacking . The writing was trite and shallow . The editing was horrible . I don't mind the style so much as the poor overuse of it . There 's a place for it . Good examples of choppy , MTV style , colorful editing ( not sure if there 's an official name ) would be Fight Club ; just off the top of my head . Even Enemy of the State had a semi similar editing style at parts . It was used tastefully and wasn't used as a crutch . I mean this is the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide . Tony Scott please give me my time back . I understand there are many people who liked this movie . I guess the idea that you 'll either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair assessment . Frankly , I hate it .  
  Why such a generic title ? Santa Claus ? So bland and unpredictable . Movies before that tried to cash in on the holiday spirit , most notably ' Santa Claus Conquers the Martians ' , at least was entertaining to watch because of the campiness to it , and all the stock footage being used .. for some reason , that seemed happy to me . But this movie just screws Christmas in the butt , and screws the joy of all the kids . Santa lives in space ? His enemy is a devil named Pitch ? Santa gets help from Merlin the Magician ? How random is this ! ? Well , since it was made in Mexico then some of you might understand the way of how the film was made . I had to admit some of the effects were just wacky for the time . It was a all-out cluster of madness ! Though , despite all the troubles with the movie , it still feels like a Christmas movie . Good conquers evil , and Christmas still plays a part of our hearts of every good girl or boy in the world , or possibly universe , thanks to Santa Claus Conquers the Martians .. apparently . So , I think you should give it a try , even if it is one of the worst holiday movies of all time .. though it should put a smile on your face any day .  
  When I was kid back in the 1970s a local theatre had Children 's Matinees every Saturday and Sunday afternoon ( anybody remember those ? ) . They showed this thing one year around Christmas time . Me and some friends went to see it . I expected a cool Santa Claus movie . What I got was a terribly dubbed ( you can tell ) and truly creepy movie . Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the Magician ( don't ask me what those two are doing in the same movie ) fighting Satan ( some joker in a silly devil costume complete with horns ! ) . The images had me cringing in my seat . I always found Santa spooky to begin with so that didn't help . The guy in the Satan suit didn't help . But what REALLY horrified me were the wooden rein deers that pulled Santa 's sled . When he wound them up and the creepy sound they made and the movements-I remember having nightmares about those things ! All these years later I still remember walking out of that theatre more than a little disturbed by what I saw . My friends were sort of frightened by it too . I just saw an ad for it on TV and ALL those nightmares came roaring back . This is a creepy , disturbing little Christmas film that will probably scare the pants off any little kid who sees it . Avoid this one-unless you really want to punish your kids . This gets a 1 .  
  I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting . I never had to read this book ( thankfully ) , or it would have been a painful experience . I got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasn't worth my time , or my friend 's . I think this story is not worth telling . It 's like saying that old people have a past before they got old ( no kidding ) . The lives of the main characters were painful to watch , one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes . However , I think the actors did the best they could with a lame story . I 've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn . I 'm writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given , which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try .  
  Description : Corny , utterly stupid and worthless . It 's so cheap and lame , it 'll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget ( I 'm guessing this .. ) probably no more than 700 dollars to make this movie . It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater . I am giving you the best advice in the world : Spare yourself , spare your time , life , and money , by NOT-I repeat , NOT even ponder about whether you should see this movie . This movie is so corny , it 'll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom . If you have a one-digit IQ , then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie . You might actually admire it . ( Like I said before , IF you have a one-digit IQ ) With about 12 actors of your own , a few puppets you bought at a garage sale , and of course cameras and music , I gaurentee you 'll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap .  
  This rip off of the 1984 hit " Gremlins " is quite possibly the biggest train wreck of a movie ever made . Even for a ' B ' grade movie , all other cheap horror movies on the same platform completely dwarf this movie in terms of plot , acting , and goodness . It begins with a random old security guard and the younger punky security guard whose name is of no importance . Why ? Because a few minutes into the film he walks into the ' forbidden ' safe , and is killed whilst living out his fantasy of being a rock star in a cheap pub . This is just an appetizer for the scat-filled main course . The main character , KEVIN , struggles various times to prove himself as more than a total pussy . Perhaps he succeeds within the film , but to the audience he proves himself as nothing more than a bad actor . Kevin gets himself a job with the old security guard , and is guided through his security shift in the ( wait for it ) abandoned studio lot . Yes why bother making a set when you can just use the studio itself . Back to the film . Kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the Hobgoblins . The Hobgoblins force people to live out their wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason . They must be returned before sunrise or else .. or else what ? Exactly . Other characters include Kevin 's ' macho ' army friend NICK , Nick 's ' woman ' DAPHNE whose character has no more substance than a bitch-slut attitude and prostitute worthy outfits . There is Kevin 's manipulative and ' reserved ' girlfriend AMY , whose deepest desire is apparently to be a badly portrayed Cher look-alike with fishnet stockings with a pair of blue grandma underpants on top .. Don't ask me how that works . Quite possibly the most entertaining character of all is KYLE . How such groups of friends are made is up for question . Kyle is a perverted creep who can't go an hour without self-stimulating . His hobbies include calling up sex-chat lines from other people 's houses and most likely sniffing underwear . The story unfolds as the heroes search for the Hobgoblins : knee-high creatures ( aka . hand puppets ) which , for some reason , attempt to travel no further than the borders of the local neighborhood . Each of the characters eventually lives out their wildest fantasy which never has anything to do with having millions of dollars .. or the film having a big budget . WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD : The twist at the end of this movie will leave the watcher wondering " What ? " . The Hobgoblins are returned to the safe by .. their own free will . Perhaps they lost patience waiting for sunrise to wreak havoc , or perhaps the story-writers got writer 's cramp and decided not to worry about the ending . Upon returning to the safe , the old security guard reveals " What he learned in the military " and detonates explosives which destroys the safe , signaling the end of the evil Hobgoblins and the end of this roller coaster ride ; better fitted to a ride on an escalator . The sheer badness of this film is enough to send someone to tears . If you plan to watch it , I recommend a few alcoholic drinks beforehand to take any serious consideration of the film out of mind .  
  I usually come on this website prior to going to the movies , as I like to see what other people think of the movie . I read many reviews which said ' thriller not a horror movie ' . This prompted me to give this film a try . I really must take issue with these ' thriller / horror ' statements , as it was neither ! I almost went and asked for my money back , and if you lot of reviewers enjoyed this rubbish .. well you must be easily pleased ! At the end of the movie , the people behind me said out loud " what a waste of time " and I turned to them and replied " I couldn't have summed it up better " . I kept waiting for something to happen .. but it didn't . There was the potential for a lot of good scares ( or thrills if you like ) but none happened . Williams acted the part quite well but I felt he was short changed by a poor script which dithered around and went nowhere . Save your money folks , this is a turkey which will be featuring at a DVD store ' bargain box ' near you in the very foreseeable future !  
  i didn't even bother finishing the movie because i was so bored i thought i was going to pass out i was watching it in the movie theaters and me and my friends just got tired so we got up and left to another movie if i ever have to sit through 2 min . of that movie again i think I 'm going to shoot myself .. and i do know the whole entire movie because my friend told me what happened at the end and i wasn't surprised at all i mean who didn't know she was going to do the right thing and let him be happy i mean for real you would have to be a complete idiot not to know that . i know i didn't miss anything and if somebody ask 's me to see that movie i would say " over my dead body " .  
  I absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end , after you 've already invested an hour into it . and that 's what happened with this film . i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote its source story . I haven't gone to read that story but I cannot imagine that it ends like this film ends . Fortunately i didn't pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it . ohh such a waste of excellent acting ( the wife in particular was so perfect ) . but milo o'shea as a Jew ? ! now THAT was funny . I haven't researched into its making but it played like the director lost his marbles or died 3/4 of the way through the film . Before that point , a story and characters were developing , there were a number of neat plot points and there wasn't too much time wasted . but ooh that last 1/2 hour - if that wasn't the screwiest , most worthless denouement I 've ever witnessed , I don't know what is . I just hate it when one 's faith is so destroyed like that ; it feels like an act of violence .  
  I watched this on the tube last night . The actor 's involved first caught my attention . The first scenes were attention getters . Some funny some sad . Good character development . I felt that the latter third of the film diverged . If it was not for the early part of the movie I would have stopped watching . I kept watching wanting to how how it tied together . Unfortunately I feel that it never happened . I especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish ( ? ) . Was that the other shoe ? Would I recommend ? No , I think not . As other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated ( 60 's jive ) but it was not too distracting . The ending totally turned me off .  
  After having seen the movie the first question arising in my mind was : Is this supposed to be irony or not ? After reading a few comments about the character Doc Savage and the comic series , I knew this film was not meant to be ironic . So , the story tells us about an US-American Super-Doc saving a south American republic from evil . Sounds like a typical story . But this one comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous . The mandatory end-fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts I have ever seen . The film might be interesting for low budget movie designers as a bad example .  
  This movie sucked ! They took something from my childhood , and raped it in an outhouse ! This movie was so bad I wanted to go home and hold my " Dukes " dvds and cry in a corner . The cast was terrible ! It wasn't " The Dukes " , it was Stiffler and Jackass driving a car . When was Boss Hogg evil ? When was Rosco a tough guy ? They never were ! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot . When did Jesse smoke pot ? He never did ! Now don't get me wrong , I 'm very liberal and there 's nothing wrong with a little chiba , but it had no place in this movie ! The only thing good about this movie was the trailers before the movie and the end credits . It was a waste of money time and air . Avoid at all costs !  
  I 've been watching a lot of cartoon or animated movies because I have a baby girl who likes to watch TV . I began to watch this movie to see if I would like my little one to watch it .. and no . At the beginning I thought it was such a cute movie like the Bambi movie , but all the way it was like insinuating the ducky was a homosexual . The info said that they were making fun of him because he wasn't good at sports , but that was not the case . It just seems like a movie made for kids to learn to be okay being gay . It was also very sad , as far as the ducky 's dad and all . I don't know , I guess if you 're gay you 'd like it , but I don't think I 'm going to watch it again with my little one .  
  I remember when THE GOLDEN CHILD was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics , and I ` m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of Eddie Murphy so I guess this movie has something going for it It gets off to a bad start where Buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face . Bad guys enter the temple Child sits with blank expression Bad guys chop up the monks Child sits with blank expression Bad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with .. Go on guess ? You do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at Michael Jackson ` s wonderland ranch he ` d still give the same blank expression , this movie would be better titled THE WOODEN CHILD The title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily . Obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated . Not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening . In fact that ` s the main problem ( And boy it ` s a serious one ) with this movie - The whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it ` s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together . I blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too . Did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be ? It ` s part fantasy , part martial arts , part buddy movie , part comedy and it ` s all crap  
  This is the kind of movie that wants to be good but sucks . First thing , what the hell are those punk trying to do with the school ? I think the kids doesn't seem to realize the gravity of the situation . Deker guy say to the girl that they under his responsibility when she ask why he wants to go back for them but right after this he gives a gun to the wheel chair dude and wants him to go alone repair the phone line . Where is the responsibility there ? I understand poor actors must pay their food but why not just give them the money that takes to make a stupid movie like that or give that money to a charity . Oh yea and none of them knows how to aim . The stupid punk guy shoots in the cafeteria nowhere like a crazy . They all want to look professional but they all suck . One more thing I don't believe that there 's no emergency exit in the school the kids are trying several doors but they all locked . What happens if there 's a fire and the dumass security guard is dead ? It is illegal to not have an emergency exit in school . Anyway there 's a lot more to say but it would be too long . I spent some time of my life to watch a crap .  
  Somewhere in his non-fiction book DANSE MACABRE , Stephen King suggests that one secret of writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers exactly what horrible thing is waiting behind the door to get them . If at last the door bursts open and a bug ten feet tall lurches through , the reader may be a little scared , but he 'll also think , " Well , I can deal with that . At least it wasn't a HUNDRED feet tall . " There 's nothing more frightening than what lurks , unseen and unknown , just on the other side of that tightly closed door , waiting to get you . THE HAUNTING is so completely misconceived that director Jan De Bont more or less starts off his movie by metaphorically throwing open that door himself and yelling : " Look , everybody , look ! It 's a ten-foot-tall bug ! Isn't that SCARY ? ! " The law of diminishing returns immediately kicks in . By the end of the movie , the director is , so to speak , jumping up and down , banging his CGI pots and pans madly , and hoarsely screaming : " Look , everyone , look ! Here come ten HUNDRED-foot-tall bugs ! .. And now , here come a hundred THOUSAND-foot-tall bugs ! " The filmmakers apparently believed that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings in this endeavor ( and there are many ) . They can't and don't . In fact , impressive as they are , the special effects are so insistent and obtrusive that the distracted viewer winds up staring at them - whether in admiration or annoyance - instead of being immersed in a story . For me , the nadir of this film 's sheer stupidity comes when a statue , with " blood " gushing from its mouth , tries to drown Liam Neeson ( as Dr . Marrow ) in a fountain . The filmmakers clearly didn't know what to do with this alleged idea once they had it , so they just have Neeson thrash around in the water a bit , flailing his arms and going glug-glug . By the next scene , the good doctor has apparently dried himself off and , ho hum , forgotten all about the annoying incident . Shirley Jackson 's novel seems to have been dumbed-down into this ridiculous screenplay by a committee of low-IQ teenage stoners who thought the way to frighten people was to make every effect bigger and louder : " Okay , next , let 's , uh , make the ceiling , you know , look like a creepy face , and , uh , come down on her .. and all these spiky things , like , trap her in the bed . " The sole saving grace of THE HAUNTING is that it at last becomes so awful that it 's actually funny . By the time Owen Wilson ( as Luke Sanderson ) fell on the floor and then went on his Magic-Carpet Ride O ' Death , I just about fell on the floor myself , laughing . Badly constructed , witless , grotesquely heavy-handed , utterly unbelievable , and filled with clunky dialogue and pointless scenes , this vacuous HAUNTING is a textbook example of how NOT to make a horror movie .  
  By the time this film was released I had seen Chorus Line on stage 4 times , and had been anticipating most eagerly the long-rumored production of a film of the story . My wife and I were in line hours before the box office opened on the day the film was released . It was not just a disappointment , it was a kick in the abdomen . First , the story was " moved outside , " so to speak , by including scenes not in the confines of the theater . Those confines are a large portion of the meaning and impact of the story . Second & Third together ( assign your own order ) : one of the original songs , with very dynamic dance number , was removed ; a song which was NOT in the stage production was added . Say what ? I 'm confused ! The only reason I gave this film 2 stars instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the performers . I 've now seen Chorus Line on stage 6 times , and wouldn't mind seeing it 6 more times before I die . It is superbly written , with wonderful music , and heart - wrenchingly true stories . If you want to see a musical which includes a great " cattle call " audition , I recommend All That Jazz . If you want to see the story of A Chorus Line , see it on stage .  
  I admit to having been a fan of the original stage production . I never saw the movie version until very lately on cable , and watched it with anticipation , to see my memories brought alive again , because I adored the original show . Imagine my dismay . This has to be the worst translation of a Broadway show to film ever made . They changed the story , they changed the songs , they lost the soul . I was expecting a trip down memory lane , singing to the extraordinarily touching Music and the Mirror , At the Ballet , and Hello Twelve , Hello Thirteen . Not ! Not only did they adulterate the music to an almost unrecognizable point , but they messed up the storyline , adding songs and exterior plotlines ( hello Cassie and Michael Douglas ) not present in the original , and injecting " drama " where it wasn't necessary . The original had enough pathos on its own . If you were a fan of the original Broadway show , don't bother . I 'm sorry I wasted my time , and diluted my memories , watching this tripe .  
  If you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood , let it be boy . But prepare yourself by bringing your hp if it comes with a radio . After having watched such a good movie as Arisan ( 2003 ) , it is terrible to see what they come up with again in Indonesia . It seems that the only idea is to make money , but no one seems seriously to work on the image of Indonesia in the world of entertainment . That it is a ' global ' world doesn't seem to come up in the minds of those who make movies in Indonesia . And since the Indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as ' Made in Indonesia ' with a flavor of the west , they get away with it . OK , the story is nice to begin with . And it could have developed into a nice flick . But did the director never think about the fact that a musical needs first of all live music OR at least good playback , and secondly good choreography ? In this movie , the playback is SO BAD that it makes you wanna cry right there in the cinema . Every single word you hear is followed seconds LATER by the actor or whoever sing playback , and it is extremely annoying while watching the movie . The choreography is as if they planned to make a movie about morning gymnastics , but in the end thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical .. They only forgot to change the choreography . It is hardly dancing you see , they jump here and there , throw their legs up in the air , and that is about it . Well , at least there 's a happy ending .. But if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic , DO SO !  
  I 'm not going to bag this film for all the myriad technical f|u|c|k|u|p|s , it would take two days to outline how the whole thing isn't even remotely possible . Others have pointed out all the relevant stupidities already . Given all that , I still could have sort of enjoyed it , if only they hadn't included all the maudlin , nauseating , infuriating , Disneyesque sentimental crap , which is so out of place anywhere , but nowhere more than out in space , where the tiniest mistake can mean instant death . The " crew " , as well as the " real " astronaut were equally guilty of putting all their fatuous nonsense ahead of everything else . It completely ruined any value the production may have had left . I 'm surprised NASA let this garbage out so that so many people would get so much misinformation about something so important to them . If you haven't seen this yet , save yourself the irritation . Watch Apollo 13 again . At least that tried to be sort of real .  
  Rumor has it that when the NASA Technical Advisors to this film were asked to keep the picture believable , they laughed for several hours . After all , unless you are a politician or work / crew the shuttle , you are not going to get in the shuttle . Furthermore , Space ( Cadet ) Camp is in Alabama , not Florida . The truth is everyone on Earth will win multi-billion dollar lottery prizes before the events depicted in this film ever become possible . This film was meant for kids , and had to have been written by one , because they are not aware of the myriad restrictions and requirements regarding access to KSC / CCAFS . This is the most useless film of all time , and it was a well deserved flop .  
  I saw this movie the first time at about twelve o'clock on a Saturday evening . It really is the perfect time for this one . I have never , EVER seen a movie that was actually more predictable and drenched with stereotypes . If you want to see a thrilling action movie , don't watch it because you might lose the will to live halfway through . However , if you want a good laugh , please watch it ! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my enjoyable Saturday night . What especially struck me is that évery scene that would be expensive to make was copy-pasted from a Discovery documentary or an old TV-special on the US Army . Furthermore I was amazed by the fact that they didn't put the slightest effort in making the production look real . Afghanistan is , as far as I can remember , nowhere near any sea and yet with a single click Deke escapes from the terrorists sand-castle with his jet-pack and is taken away by a submarine ( probably Discovery ) . Later on in the movie , Deke throws an Islam terrorist against the wall . In the slow motion scene you can beautifully see the long hairs of the Korean stuntman flap in the air when smashed against the wall . Gotta love it . I recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer though , only then you 'll understand why I 've been mad enough to spend 6,99 euro 's on the box .  
  A killer , cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder . At his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave . This of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look . The two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem , are back on the case . Two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing . Thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection . Sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish . The acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays Dr Vincent van Gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film . The other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out . Now I 'm all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible . If it wasn't for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness I would probably have fallen asleep . There is a bit of gore but it 's never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims . The zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times . There is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll . The doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a film . It is just a plastic toy on a fishing line . The ending is extremely bad . You would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does . God knows how they made enough money to make a sequel . 4/10  
  What the heck was this . Somebody obviously read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester . We get existential angst mixed in with cheap horror . There were moments that were disturbing but each one was canceled out by horrible music , CGI , or acting . The problem with weird narratives like this is that it feels lazy . Even David Lynch 's work feels like that at times , and just like his interesting shows and movies it runs far far too long . And sadly this is only 98 minutes . The cast was attractive , and that is about the limit to this . I suppose it touches on feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness we all have , but just doesn't make the characters likable enough for us to care about their fates .. whatever they were . The final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous .  
  this movie had more holes than a piece of swiss cheese . Ben Affleck was seriously NOT trying to act in any way , shape , or form . He outright sucked . Nothing about the movie was believable . The first problems were in the intro - where the man gives everything of value to the Salvation Army Santa Claus but it doesn't show why . And then the granny sticks her head in the oven - really beautiful , and has absolutely nothing to do with the movie - it 's not even in the same tone as the movie . There was no explanation of the motivation for Ben Affleck to choose the house he chose ; there was not any believable reactions by the family he chose ; and people are swayed here and there without any cause to be swayed ( Example : Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck 's characters go tobogganing down a steep slope - this is the incident that makes her suddenly fall in love with him . Riight .. ) Anyway , there was a funny moment or two - but they were a rarity in the movie . It seriously needed another rewrite ( or 4 ) . Hope you enjoy !  
  Philip . K . Dickian movie . And a decent one for that matter . Better than the Paycheck ( Woo ) and that abomination called Minority Report ( Spielberg ) . But lets face it , the twisting and cheesing ending was a bit too much for me . Half way through the movie I already started to fear about such kind of ending , and I was regrettably right . But that does not mean that the film is not worth its time . No , not at all . First half ( as already many here have commented ) is awesome . There are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is highly important thing in the future ( we will do such kind on corny sf things because we CAN ) or is it simply over combining . But the paranoia is there and feeling " out of joint " also . Good one .  
  There is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film : Major Chick Davis ( Pat O'Brien ) . O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets-the bombardier . But he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly . In fact , he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military . He 's tough when he has to be , yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor , roles he perfected in other films . His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves . O'Brien seems natural in the role , and plays it in fine fashion . Two things help this movie : O'Brien 's performance and the spectacular special effects ending .  
  Seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie . And so I sat down for 102 minutes of unbelief . Beside Ed Harris no-one seems to own the skills of acting . Even Sean Connery , who I normally worship , must have had an off-day during the entire filming of Just Case . Not once in during the whole movie one actor could convince me . This made this movie look cheap and unreal . The story makes up a little . It is thrilling , and the plot is unexpected . Conclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do .  
  I would rather of had my eyes gouged out with rusty ice picks than have had to sit through this abortion . There is no plot . There is no acting ability . Ray Liota has shamed himself and should be blacklisted from any more work . I am so sorry that the industry allows crap like this to be shown on any type of medium . Rumor has it that Maddona threw herself to the floor to break her other arm so she could be taken away on a stretcher . Actully , she deserves to be married to this loser and wanna be actor director . I hope she stays in London and never returns to the USA . Please do not waste your money on this so called film . I beg of you .  
  Was convincing the world that he didn't exist .. This is a line that is probably remembered by a lot of people . It 's from The Usual Suspects of course in relation to Kaiser Gold .. I mean Sose .. I got another one like that : - The dumbest trick a director ever pulled was trying to convince an audience he actually had a storyline - This movie is one of the saddest pieces of film-making I have seen in a long time . It starts out so well , with really fantastic cinematography , great acting and a very smart premise . But alas , the only way this movie is heading is on a course of self-destruction . And it does so , not by a single blow but with nagging little wrist-cuts . Pay no attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this donut . With enough booze in my brain I would probably be capable of explaining the very existence of mankind to a very plausible degree . I have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways people explained the story . And they vary from a story set totally in someones head , playing chess with himself , to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess gaming . And that 's all jolly swell . But at the same time it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story . And apart from that , it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like " Fight Club , Kill Bill , Casino , The Usual Suspects , Snatch , Magnolia and Shachnovelle . And we are not dealing with kind borrowing here , it 's a blatant robbery . What ultimately goes wrong here in this movie is that the storyline swirls like a drunk bum on speed . If this movie was a roller-coaster ride , you 'd have crashed into the attraction next to it shorty after take off . There are so many twists in this movie which will never be resolved , that if it was a cocktail , you 'd be needing a life supply of hurl-buckets to work of the nausea after drinking it . Nothing is ever explained and when you finally get some grasp of the direction you think it 's going , you get pulled in yet another one . I guess this story wasn't going anywhere on paper and Ritchy must have thought that is was awesome to make a movie out of it anyway , being the next David Lynch or something . 1/10 for totally violating one 's own work ( Ritchy : seek professional help ) . What could have easily been a gem instead becomes a contrived art-piece , food for pseudo intellectuals to debate on at sundayafternoon debating-clubs . Spare your soul and stomach , avoid at all cost !  
  David Chase 's " The Sopranos " is perhaps the most over-praised television show in recent memory . Not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion , it 's devoid of a soul . As anyone reading likely knows already , James Gandolfini * IS * Tony Soprano , a big , fat a * hole of a mob boss with a spoiled b * tch of a wife , and two bratty , sh * t-brained kids living in - you guessed it - the armpit of America ( that 's New Jersey , by the way ) . Not only is Tony a womanizing adulterer , he 's also an unrepentant murdering scumbag , with a crew of " Saturday Night Live " skit-worthy caricatures for subordinates . It 's not the fact that Tony is a piece of sh * t mobster that offends me ( and apparently only me ) . Allowing characters to be who and what they are , without judgment , is something American TV hardly allows . But Chase - and his entourage of money-gorged , Emmy-gored writers - have not simply allowed us to observe Tony and his crew as they behave , nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action / reaction reality of ( even obviously fictionalized ) organized crime ( a la " The Godfather " ) . Instead , Chase glorifies and endorses his characters ' greedy , violent , and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that Tony , his wife , and even his hair-brained psychologist do week after week ( or should I say month after month . Or is it year after year ? It seems like the show 's paltry 13-episode seasons come out with the same regularity as a lunar eclipse ) . Much has been made of the series ' refusal to adhere to " network " structure , with plot lines that go nowhere , and characters that pop-up and disappear like backyard vermin . But if the show is so brilliant in its lack of structure , why does it always feel like I 'm watching a soap-opera ? Tired mob clichés , bored housewives , self-serving , irredeemable characters AND plots that go nowhere . More than ever , I can see why so many Americans of Italian heritage are p * ssed at this show . It 's enough to make you want to curl up with a good book ( Danté 's " Inferno " springs to mind ) . People on IMDb love to claim that there 's nothing good on television , and therefore " The Sopranos " is a breath of fresh air . Are these same people too busy paying their cable bills to watch " The Shield " ? ( It 's included in Basic , ya know ) . How about the ( still good ) " The West Wing " ? Or the brilliantly acted ( if erratically written ) " Boston Legal " ? What about possibly the best comedy of the last few decades , " Arrested Development " ? And lest we forget that we live in an age of DVDs - nobody * has * to watch * anything * new . I 'd much rather shell out $ 40 for an over-priced boxed set of , well , pretty much * anything * , than give HBO $ 10 a month ( or $ 80 a DVD set ! ) to continue to prove how much of a hack-factory it can be . You want good television ? Watch " Homicide : Life on the Street . " Or " Murder One " . Or " Picket Fences " . Or even Chase 's prior show , " Northern Exposure . " If you 're already among " The Sopranos " ' s legion of brain-washed fans and critics , it 's too late for you . But if not , leave Tony and his worthless kin where they all belong - rotting with the fishes . ( " Sleeping " would be way too kind )  
  This movie is just plain terrible ! Slow acting , slow at getting to the point and wooden characters that just shouldn't have been on there . The best part was the showing of Iron Maiden singing in some video at a theater and thats it . the ending was worth watching and waiting up for but that was it ! The characters in this movie put me to sleep almost . Avoid it !  
  Even when I saw this movie at a teenager , I wondered just how ironic it was that Pia Zadora starred in a movie about an artist who slept her way to the top . As beautiful and sexy as Ms . Zadora is , even she couldn't keep this sorry-ass excuse of a movie from tanking . Not even her photoshoot for Penthouse , in which " The Lonely Lady " was promoted " back in the day , " could keep this movie from tanking . The only thing that could have saved this movie ? A completely different script . Give this one a miss .  
  Immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago , a friend and I decided that it defined the absolute zero on the movie scale . There was nothing about the movie that could have been done worse than it was . To this day we still rate movies , even very bad ones , by how much better than " The Lonely Lady " they are . A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry , who wrote the screenplays for , among other things , " Last Summer " and " Diary of a Mad Housewife , " and she related that she had been asked to write a screenplay for the Harold Robbins ' book " The Lonely Lady . " She said that she sent in a treatment and it was rejected because they didn't think she understood the difficulties of a female screenwriter in Hollywood . She then said " I think they got someone else to write it . " The interview was filmed before the movie was released . She died in 1981 , and I bet the first thing she did on arrival in heaven was personally thank God for saving her from involvement in the result .  
  Curiously , it is Rene Russo 's eyes and mouth-not Buddy the Gorilla's - that emerge as the focal point of " Buddy " , a Jim Henson Pictures production through Francis Ford Coppola 's Zoetrope . Somehow , countless close-ups of Russo 's face slipped passed in the post-production stages , and she literally fills the screen so many times the poor apes are upstaged . Unintentionally funny true story adapted from Gertrude " Trudy " Davies Lint 's memoirs about a wealthy doctor 's wife who turns their mansion into a menagerie for pets and wild-life . The movie goes beyond good intentions .. it positively drips with earnest sincerity . The movie never sparkles with the kind of " family film " magic that it needed , and before too long both the people and the animals seem distinctly programmed ( nothing here feels real ) . About ten minutes in , two chimpanzees are goofing around in Russo 's kitchen and start throwing a butcher 's knife back and forth ( it misses Alan Cumming 's head by inches ) ; yet , no eyebrows are raised because it 's all in a day 's fun . Still , when full-grown gorilla Buddy gets crazy during a thunderstorm , the cops are called-and everyone stares at Buddy through the window while he busts up the living room furniture . The furniture should be the least of anyone 's worries in this flabbergasting , do-gooder failure . But , at least we know Russo was in good hands : whenever director Caroline Thompson needs a good pick-up shot , she gives unstartled Rene another extreme close-up . I wonder what the lipstick budget was on this picture ? * from *  
  I purchased the BLOOD CASTLE DVD on eBay for a few bucks not knowing what it was and all I can say is that I wasn't disappointed with this purchase . BLOOD CASTLE is one of those trashy European horror films that has almost no redeeming quality except for being thoroughly entertaining , for all the bad reasons . The opening alone was worth the price of the DVD : our heroine , Dr . Ivanna , arrives at the castle where she 's supposed to help a scientist , Baron Dalmar , who does experiments on dead tissue . On her way to the castle 1 ) a man tries to rape Ivanna . 2 ) the castle 's housekeeper fights with her . 3 ) the maid wants her dead . 4 ) and finally , Baron Dalmar nearly spits on her and wants her out the next day . Hmm .. something tells me she 's not welcome . With such a miserable arrival , you 'd think Ivanna would leave the place in a NY minute but no , like so many great trashy films , our " headstrong " heroine decides to stay put and even enjoys a candlelight dinner with the grumpy Baron on that same eventful day . The intro is so over-the-top trashy ( it 's even greater than the memorable first few minutes of that Canadian film , JUNIOR ) that I knew I was going to enjoy this . But the fun doesn't end there . Ivanna is repeatedly drugged whenever she goes to bed at night , only to wake up from unconsciousness , naked , bound and tortured in mild sessions of S & M by an unseen man . Even after experiencing these nightly S & M sessions , Ivanna stays at the castle , dully convinced by the angry Baron that what she 's experiencing are nothing more than dreams . To be expected , even after being treated so badly from the get-go , Ivanna , falls in love with the Baron . Ivanna completely disregards anything negative about him , including the obvious fact that the dour Baron is popular with the young ladies . Every women at the castle ( it seems only women work there ) is in love with the miserable chump , who doesn't mind taking advantage of the pretty young things . Things get even sillier as someone lurks around the estate and kills ( and has been killing ) women . Basically , the Baron 's physically disfigured brother , Igor is responsible for everything . In a very long winded scene , the brother warns the Baron he should not get too involved with Ivanna or he 'll suffer the consequences . So what do the Baron and Ivanna do about this ? Well , they get married of course ! During the very brief marriage ceremony , the Baron is shot by one of the angry locals ( father of one of the dead girls ) . But all of this doesn't deter Ivanna , who , amidst all the dead young ladies and torture surrounding them , cheerfully comforts the hurt Baron that " it 's just a flesh wound " and the two can go on and enjoy their honeymoon at the castle , where the killer / rapist / torturer brother is . The whole thing quickly devolves into a nightmarish love triangle of sorts , between Ivana , the Baron and Igor . Blame it all on love ! Anyway , you get the idea : subtle it 's not . Almost everything is over-the-top ridiculous in this film and when it 's not OTT , such as the predictable climax , things get a tad boring . But for most of the film , the director or writer revel in one illogically trashy moment after another . I really love these kind of films , everything as subtle as being hit over the head with a sledgehammer , and populated by characters behaving illogically . Even those who made the Retromedia DVD realize this and when you go to the scene selection section , we hear one of the funniest bits of dialogue from the dubbed movie looped endlessly . The production values are beautifully risible . The opening and closing credits , with those candles and red curtains .. ah , a soupçon of class . The music sounds sometimes like something from a Tim Burton film , which only adds to the oddness of it all . And customary to these kind of films , when the young ladies take off their clothes , they just beg to be killed . As a standard film , I rate this a 2 , but as a " it 's so bad it 's good " film , I rate it a solid 8 stars . If you enjoy trashy films , please watch this one . It 's a must see . The only thing left for me to ponder about it : what would it have taken for that woman to get out of that freaking castle ?  
  Some good movies keep you in front of the TV , and you are dying to see the result . This movie does not have highs and lows . It simply describes a young girl 's family life in Africa . People come and go , the weather and the background are all the same .  
  Unfortunately the movie is more concerned with making lame social commentary on a real event , but doesnt have the balls to legitimately document what happened . The constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame ( I get the impression Ben Coccio is an avid gamer ) , or how media and music is completely devoid of influence is the obvious message ( we even get a laughable scene of the two boys burning ALL their cd 's , talk about subtlety ! ) , but the movie only gets away with it because its ' fiction ' . Nice try . Yes its a great idea to relieve media of influence , but how do we know the kids that have actually planned and executed a school shooting werent influenced by media ? or video games ? We dont , and we wont with this movie because once again these kids are smart enough to completely relinquish the media , yet dumb enough to scorch a nazi symbol on the ground ? haha I somehow dont think so . The movie bats you over the head with its portrayal of the normalcy of the families , its almost doing a disservice to think that there wasn't a serious flaw in the family dynamic of kids that have actually gone out and shot their fellow schoolmates . Why is everyone so concerned with making killers seem " normal " , when they are so obviously not ? A completely false and phony depiction .  
  A childless couple ( Brooke Adams , Jeff Hayenga ) go to a doctor ( James Karen ) to try to conceive . It works but Adams slowly becomes aware that there 's something seriously wrong with the baby .. Pretty interesting idea is thoroughly done in by a lousy script-the basic idea is OK but becomes screamingly predictable towards the end . I saw every " twist " coming . The direction is poor-he seems to have no idea how to shoot a basic scene . The production values are-to be nice-lousy . Very shabby . And , the gore scenes are too unpleasant ( I almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach ) with lousy special effects . The film completely derails at the end when it becomes quite clear they had no idea HOW to end this film . Some good acting makes it somewhat bearable . Adams , Hayenga and Karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching but that was about it . This film barely got released in 1991 and still remains unknown-it 's easy to see why . I give it a 4 .  
  Waldemar Daninsky ( Paul Naschy ) travels to Tibet and is bitten by a yeti , which causes him to become a werewolf . He is accidentally killed after he attacks his cheating wife and her lover , and is later revived by a female scientist , Dr . Ilona Ermann , who uses him in mind control experiments . Daninsky later discovers an underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor 's failed experiments . Upon hearing of Naschy 's death from colleague Jon Kitley , I rummaged through my collection for a suitable film to watch . In my scramble , I found I own not one but three ( ! ) copies of " Fury of the Wolfman " . The film is of questionable video quality , the sound is dubbed in a mediocre fashion , the cinematography is sort of slapstick style at times . And the American versions have two love scenes removed . Quite frankly , without a remastered , uncut copy , I wasn't really getting the proper movie in all its glory . This film claims to be the fourth in a long series about the werewolf Count Waldemar Daninsky . I suspect this is true , but you wouldn't know this from the film itself . The plot is confusing at times , and there 's really no indication that this is a sequel . If you read the plot summaries on Wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box , you 'll see that I 'm not alone in my confusion . Perhaps the film 's shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through . While floating around for years , it was only released in 1973 , due to problems involved in finding a distributor . And Naschy said in his autobiography that the director , Zabalza , was an incompetent alcoholic , and that he hated working with him . Those really aren't light accusations , and I have no idea what Zabalza had to say on his own behalf . Chances are , sooner or later you 'll come across a low-grade version of " Fury of the Wolfman " . It appears in a variety of three-packs and box sets , so you might accidentally acquire it and not even know . What really needs to happen is an American uncut version , with a decent sound and video mix , and the love scenes thrown back in . As far as I know , this does not exist . Let us honor Paul Naschy 's legacy and get his films to a wider audience in a level of quality he deserves .  
  I almost called HBO and demanded my money back for the month just because they 've been airing this movie . I can just see the movie execs sitting around going , " Okay , we need to come up with something that 's just like Home Alone , only we 'll add a bunch of cash for the kid , hire cut-rate actors , and oh yeah , we 'll make it a lot less funny ! " Okay , maybe not the last part , but that 's basically what you 've got here . Not even worth seeing if someone else rents it . And as a movie for kids ? Forget it . I wouldn't let my kids see this , not necessarily because of bad-taste jokes , but because I wouldn't want them to say , " What were you thinking showing us that lame piece of garbage , Dad ? ! ? ! "  
  The worst movie I have seen in a while . Yeah its fun to fantasize , but if that is what you are looking for , I suggest you see Brewsters Millions . This was just terrible and corny and terrible at being corny . Unless you are five or like terrible movies , don't see this one .  
  Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but Europeans did , and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines . But then in the third episode he says that when the Europeans in South Africa got too far north they ran into Zulu people and other tribes that * herded cattle and planted crops * . So what explains their lack of technological , economic , and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for success ? Diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox ( brought to North America by black slaves ) were our biggest weapon . Well , if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zulus * without a single casualty * in either case , then I think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant . With or without germs , we were going to succeed . He says Malaria stopped Europeans from colonizing further North , killing " thousands " of Europeans while not affecting Africans . ( I 'd like to know real numbers but he doesn't say . ) Then at the end he says today Malaria is killing thousands of Africans and that is why they can't catch up with us . So which is it , Jared ? Did Malaria help the Africans by halting Eurpeans or hurt them ? And how come Europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history ? He also seems far too eager to say that the reasons Europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck . At times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories he 's reluctant to admit that maybe Europeans were successful because they worked for it . It 's sad watch this obvious neo-Marxist contort reality to try to prove his point .  
  I finally got to have a look at this experimental Lynch short after waiting for so long .. and unfortunately , it wasn't worth it ! Even for a die hard Lynch fan , I found this to be really tedious .. nothing happens , there are long , long , long painful pauses where nothing happens , long , monotonous speeches where nothing is said and the whole thing finishes with the viewer not knowing , or caring , what the hell it was all about , what happened before and what happened afterward . There was a Mulholland Drive allusion - the blonde girl and the brunette girl were very Diane and Rita - esque , and a Lost Highway moment with allusions to some significant event that happened but cannot be talked about clearly . Unfortunately , It 's all very uninteresting and very dull , nothing happens , it 's very forgettable and I think i will delete it from my computer and forget I ever watched it . Sorry David !  
  i went into watching this movie knowing it wasn't going to be great . but what i witnessed was to awful for words . i don't mean to be harsh , its just the movie was terrible . overall it had bad , i mean AWFUL special effects , the acting wasn't too bad , but wasn't good either , and sasquatch himself was like .. well , not sasquatch . in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is Harry and the Hendersons . its not violent or horror , but it has the best depiction of sasquatch . at least its a suit and not some half-ass cgi rip-off . only see this movie if you are desperate , or really appreciate anyone in the film . or go watch boondock saints , it is MUCH better .  
  The recent boom of dating show on U . S . television screens has reached a fevered pitch since the first episode of " The Bachelor . " Unsuspecting audiences have since been subjected to countless clones and variations , including " The Bachelorette " , " Joe Millionaire " , " For Love Or Money " , and the execrable " Married By America . " Hoping to cash in on this trend , and simultaneously tap and exploit a new demographic , Bravo has unleashed the disastrous " Boy Meets Boy " upon the world . And may they have mercy on us all . The premise is simple and is designed to be light-hearted : an eligible gay man is courted by a number of suitors , eliminated show by show until one is left , but there 's a twist . Half of the men are actually straight . This is not much of a big deal , but the inherent viciousness of the scenario kicks in after hearing the pay-off : if , at the end of the show , the gay man picks a straight man in disguise , the straight man wins a cash prize . The gay man gets nothing , or at least nothing more than a few parting gifts , a pat on the back , and a hearty round of " Aren't you embarrassed ? Well , thanks for playing ! " Just the like the equally painful " Queer Eye For The Straight Guy " ( another Bravo program ) , this show is another example of stereotypes run amok . What makes it even worse , though , is the fact that straight men are playing UP these stereotypes for cash . The producers of this show believe that all you have to do is put enough hair gel in a man 's hair , dress up in Abercrombie & Fitch with a pair of designer sandals , strip him of all body hair and fat and voila ! It 's the gay equivalent to putting a white performer in blackface , and just as offensive to those of us - like myself - who are genuinely gay and don't dress / act like that . It implies that gays have no variance or chance for individuality , that they can't behave like real people , only like stereotypes . Never mind the fact that the bank of suitors is sorely lacking in any kind of diversity . All are gym-toned , most are white , and all look far too scrubbed and cleaned . This is another example of how , instead of fostering acceptance of gays as dynamic individuals capable of variance and change , Hollywood has again taken a stereotype and run with it all the way to the bank . I feel genuinely dirty watching this show , as show any gay man who sees this unabashed parade of soft-core pornography masquerading as legitimate television . 1 out of 10 .  
  This show is just annoying ! I feel sorry for the actors for having to attempt to be funny ( especially Bob Saget ) , the laugh track tries to cover up the sad jokes and the " Aww " track comes up at the most unnecessary times . The over-dramatic kids are no exception , especially the Olsen twins . Also , this show is cliché city . If you were to look up the word cliché , it would read " Full House " Every story line has a " life lesson " to be learned at the end . A sappy speech makes everything better and even has the ability to make the most bratty child have a sudden realization of goodness GASP too bad this couldn't be possible in real life . I don't know how someone could watch this show without bad mouthing the behavior of the characters or the laugh track . i find myself yelling at the TV saying , " THAT Isn't FUNNY / SAD / CUTE " If life were really like this , the world would fall apart .  
  By 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it . Still , instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it , they went ahead and made it anyway . Apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film , they decided to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible . Hell , it worked for The Wild Bunch so why shouldn't it work here ? Of course , The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of The Last Hard Men is plain old-fashioned rubbish . It 's hard to figure out what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles . Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw ( Coburn ) . The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston 's daughter ( Barbara Hershey ) is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation . This is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over-the-top detail . It 's tremendously disappointing really , because the star pairing sounds like a mouth-watering prospect . There 's no sense of pace or urgency in the film either . It takes an eternity to get going , but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on nastiness . All in all , this might be the very worst film that Heston ever made . I 'm sure it 's one of the productions he is loathe to include on his illustrious CV .  
  I don't know why I 'm taking the time to review this waste-of-time movie . If you stick with it long enough in hopes of a satisfying conclusion  good , bad , or surprising  don't . It finally fizzles out after stiff , formulaic , predictable dialogue and acting . Indoor scenes are so harshly lit you think if the camera were zoomed out one millimeter further you 'd see the klieg lights . Costumes , hair-do 's , and sets are starched , pressed , and immaculate . Are we supposed to imagine common people really lived like that in early 20th-century Arizona ? Other reviews ' comparisons to Sam Peckinpah are an insult to Peckinpah : at least that director wove his violence into the context of chaos and mayhem . HARD MEN 's gore is gratuitous exploding squibs from wooden impersonations of bad guys with manicured fingernails . Huh ? ! ? I can believe Heston thought he might have been making something of worth with this film . ( He does get to clutch his gun in his cold fingers . ) But Coburn ? I 'll never guess why he signed up for this travesty . Want to see a movie about the end of the West as we knew it , the end of Westerns as we knew them ? Watch THE SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN again . THE LAST HARD MEN is a mockery of an obituary to the Western .  
  I think Jason Lee has huge potential , but this was the WRONG vehicle in which to attempt to break out as a star . The plot is awful , the comedy is awful . I laughed twice , I think for relief , because in retrospect , they were fairly lame jokes . I found myself scared for the future of Fletch , and had to console myself that it was the film that was flawed , not Lee . Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot , but I recommend looking at the still photos on this website to figure that out , instead of this film . Save your time . 1 star .  
  " A Guy Thing " tries to capture the feeling of " There 's Something About Mary " or " Meet the Parents " but comes off more like it was edited up out of cutting-room rejects of those two films . Thankfully I rented it on a 5-day rental because I couldn't sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time . The premise is decent and I liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up for Paul 's missteps ( the checker at the Save-mart was great ) but the script-writing is absolutely horrible . The dialog falls flat most of the time and just when you think that things are finally going to get on track some needless sight-gag is stuck in for no good reason . Plus how many toilet jokes does one movie really need ? Don't get me wrong , slapstick humor is great when it 's smartly done as in the other films I mentioned , but this movie simply misses the mark . Too bad as I love Julia Stiles ( Ten Things I Hate About You was great ) but even that couldn't help me sit through this terrible movie . Save your dollars and go rent " There 's Something About Mary " one more time .  
  I 'm not a big fan of rom / coms at the best of times . A few have been quite good ( check of Dream for an Insomniac ) , but this one is just more of the same but less . With a running time of 100min , I expect more than 1 laugh every 30mins . The only real belly laugh are when male strangers and friends instinctivly help out Lee 's character . All I can say is AVOID . I gaurentee there is at least 10 other movies on the shelf that deserve you $ 3 of out 10 ( And only cos I 'm a big Lee fan )  
  Jochen Hick wrote and directed this little thriller of a suspense film based on the concept that the AIDS virus was a sheep virus mutated by the government to rid the world of gays and was apparently tested on convicts in the years before the outbreak of the hideous disease . Were it not for the poignancy of the concept of the film , this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant non-prejudicial infective organism . Stefan ( Tom Wlaschiha ) journeys from Berlin to San Francisco to investigate his father 's scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused . He meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory , but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation . Simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place , each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from Puccini 's opera ' Turandot ' which just happens to be opening at the San Francisco Opera . A police investigator Louise Tolliver ( Irit Levi ) and her companion cop ( Kalene Parker ) follow the murders while Stefan makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in San Francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father 's theory . He encounters a strange lad Jeffrey ( Jim Thalman ) with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent Doctor Burroughs ( Richard Conti ) who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects . How this all come to an end is the play of the film , a story as much about the search for self identity between Stefan and Jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murders . While Tom Wlaschiha , Jim Thalman and Richard Conti do well with their roles ( they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film ! ) , the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented Irit Levy and Kaylene Parker : when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero . There are some small cameos by other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit , but in all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of ' Nessun dorma ' as sung by Mario del Monaco from a recording o the opera - and that seems to be the reason for making the film ! Good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors , but there is no resolution of the initial premise that started the whole thing . Grady Harp , February 06  
  Isabel Allende 's magical , lyrical novel about three generations of an aristocratic South American family was vandalized . The lumbering oaf of a movie that resulted-largely due to a magnificent cast of Anglo actors completely unable to carry off the evasive Latin mellifluousness of Allende 's characters , and a plodding Scandinavian directorial hand-was so uncomfortable in its own skin that I returned to the theater a second time to make certain I had not missed something vital that might change my opinion . To my disappointment , I had not missed a thing . None among Meryl Streep , Jeremy Irons , Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave could wiggle free of the trap set for them by director Bille August . All of them looked perfectly stiff and resigned , as if , by putting forth as little effort as possible , they expected to fade unnoticed into lovely period sets . ( Yes , the film was art directed within an inch of its life . ) Curious that the production designer was permitted the gaffe of placing KFC products prominently in a scene that occurs circa 1970-years before KFC came into being . Back then , it was known by its original name : Kentucky Fried Chicken . Even pardoning that , what on earth is Kentucky Fried Chicken doing in a military dictatorship in South America in 1970 ? American fast food chains did not hit South America until the early 1980s . " The House of the Spirits " should have been the motion picture event of 1993 . Because it was so club-footed and slavishly faithful to its vague idea of what the novel represented , Miramax had to market it as an art film . As a result , it was neither event nor art . And for that , Isabel Allende should have pressed charges for rape .  
  OK , this has got 2 be one of the worst excuses 4 a movie that i have ever had the misfortune of watching . Like all other Olsen twins movies with the possible exception of new york minute , this film had no story , gaping plot holes , disgustingly putrid acting and bad filming even ! in case you haven't guessed yet I HATE MARY KATE AND ASHLEY ! The only reason i watched this was because i was really bored and nothing else was on . I wonder if the twins will EVER stop making the same stereotypical movies where they have an unbelievably stupid adventure in an exotic location and save the day meanwhile getting the help of two cute guys who drool over them immediately . The least they could would be to have a guy 4 1 of them or have them both falling 4 the same guy . The plot in this story was so imbecilic and just plain dumb . even a toddler could see the flaws in it . Maybe they should split up and start making films individually or maybe films with a different kind of story . Anyone who liked this movie was no offense-either really stupid , really artificial or has not seen any really good movie . or maybe they are really smart and just have bad cinematic choices . either way i would not recommend this movie to my worst nemesis for a good movie experience .. the only thing it is good 4 is some rib splitting laughter at the pathetic attempts to be cool . if you watch for laughs it 's hilarious . basically i give it 0 or less .  
  For those of you who 've never heard of it ( or seen it on A & E ) , Cracker is a brilliant British TV show about an overweight , chain-smoking , foulmouthed psychologist named Fitz who helps the Manchester police department get into the heads of violent criminals . It 's considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of England ( and that 's saying something ) , and was tremendously successful in England and around the world back in 1993 . Now , the original stars have re-teamed with the original writer to knock out one more 2-hour episode . I 've loved this show ever since I 'd first seen it , over a decade ago . The DVD box set holds a place of honor in my collection , and I can quote a good deal of Fitz 's interrogation scenes practically word for word . The idea of Robbie Coltrane reteaming with Jimmy McGovern for another TV movie about Fitz filled me with absolute glee . I 'll start with the good . One of the many things that impressed me about the original Cracker series was how quickly Fitz was defined as a character . Five minutes into the first episode  with his lecture ( throwing the books into the air ) , his drinking , and his cussing of the guy after him on the gambling machine queue  and you knew , simply knew , who this character was . You could feel him " clicking " in your mind , the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writer . Coltrane , of course , remained great throughout the show , but I always felt that some of the later episodes  those not written by McGovern  mistreated the character . So the good news is this : Fitz is back . As soon as you see him in this show  making incredibly inappropriate comments at his daughter 's wedding  you 'll feel that " click " once again . It 's him : petulant one moment and truly sorry the next , always insightful , sincere to the point of tactlessness but brilliantly funny in the process . If you love this character as much as I do , you 'll be delighted with how he is portrayed in the movie . And this extends to Judith and Mark : in fact , everything having to do with the Fitzs is handled perfectly . The problem I do have with this movie revolves around the crime Fitz is trying to solve . In standard Cracker fashion , we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes  the suspense lies in seeing Fitz figure it out . In this case , we have a serial killer who is out for American blood . And the reason for this , unfortunately , is not due to any believable psychological trauma  rather , it seems that the murders are here simply to allow the writer to display his personal political beliefs . It 's difficult for me to write this , as I truly believe that Jimmy McGovern is one of the greatest writers in the world . Nor do I have a problem with movies that are about current issues , or movies that take a political stand . But in the Cracker universe , we expect to see the characters behaving like human beings , not like caricatures . Instead , the Americans in this movie are all depicted in an entirely stereotypical fashion . They 're know-nothing loudmouths who complain about everything , treat the locals like crap and cheat on their wives  one of them even manages to do all of the above within less than 5 minutes . I honestly thought I 'd mistakenly switched channels or something . But it doesn't stop there . We get constant reminders of just how badly the war in Iraq is going  reminders that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story and appear practically out of nowhere . The killer is so busy ranting about how Bush is worse than Hitler that he almost forgets to get on with the killing ; but more to the point , he is such a mouthpiece for the writer 's political views that he forgets to act like a believable human being , and thus we  as an audience  don't buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man to a tortured serial-killing soul . I can't say that this ruined the show for me  it 's was still good TV , better than almost everything else in the genre ( mainly due to , once again , Coltrane ) . But its constant politicizing made it impossible for it to be as good as the real Cracker classics like " To Be A Somebody "  an episode that was just as " issuey " , but one that was handled with far more subtlety and psychological depth . Two other small points : Panhandle not being around is a disappointment , but what 's worse are her replacements . The entire police department  which for so long filled with such great characters - is now full of vanilla . Completely interchangeable cops who lack any and all personality ( how you could drain Coupling 's Richard Coyle of personality is beyond me , but it is indeed missing here ) . Also , there are couple of moments where the show lost its believability for me . One such instance revolves around Fitz having to narrow down the entire population of Manchester from 1 million to a hundred based on some very strange criteria ( French windows ? How does the computer know if I have French windows ? )  he not only succeeds in doing this , but he succeeds in less than an hour . I don't think so . So , all in all , I was a little disappointed . It 's recommended viewing , but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door . Still , if there 's new series to come after this , it would all have been for the good : I 'm convinced that McGovern can still write great stuff , and maybe now that he 's got his politics out of his system he can go back to writing about people .  
  I rarely make these comments but I felt compelled to spare others the pain I endured in watching this movie . It 's so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply can't suspend disbelief . The problem starts early , when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new Porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle , overlooking the Capitol Building in Washington , D.C. That kind of life on a government salary ? Hah ! It only gets worse . Toward the end , when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys , the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die , in order to cleanse the gene pool . The special effects are pretty good - any producer 's money can buy that - and the lead actors have been great in other films , but the screenplay and direction here are moronic . Many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind Paul Verhoeven 's previous , facially stupid movies ( Showgirls , Starship Troopers ) , but this movie should stop the wondering . He 's just plain bad .  
  This show had a lot of hype but I didn't know about it until the midseason ( season 1 ) . Someone even recommended the show to me . But I decided that if I was going to watch it , I was going to wait until the end of the season so I could watch it in bulk . Due to the show 's format , I 'm happy I waited . I imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story . Somehow , this show has managed to throw in too much sex . Jason will have sex with pretty much anything that moves . Right after he finds out that one woman he had sex with was killed , he 's in bed with another woman the next night ! Then Tara and Sam get it on , despite each of them knowing that Sam is in love with Sookie . And for some reason , Sookie gets mad when she later finds out about it-even though she 's sleeping with a vampire . One of the problems with the show , is that it doesn't do a good job of making you care about the characters . I really didn't care for Jason at all . Along with his endless pursuit of tale , he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him . After a few episodes , I wouldn't have minded if he got killed somehow . For that reason , I was for the most part uninterested in the murders until Sookie 's Grandmother became a victim ( since the first two were more closely involved with Jason ) . Then once Sookie and Bill have sex , the story gets a few more subplots . Tara 's mother wants an exorcism , then the exorcist lady tries to convince Tara that she should have one to remove her own demon . I wasn't so much bothered by the whole exorcism thing as I know there are some people who really believe in that stuff . However , they waste little time in showing that is it a farce right after Tara spends about $ 1300 on exorcisms for her and her mother . At other points , some of the developments happen too fast . Jason continues being a jerk , trying to sell his Grandmother 's stuff to buy vampire blood , which apparently is the new crack or something . In his search he finds this girl who will do V ( vampire blood ) with him . They get high , and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of V . Another example is when Bill has to go to a vampire tribunal . He 's only gone for two days before Sookie starts to feel abandoned and start to wonder if he thinks " vampire politics " are more important than her . Subtlety is not this show 's strong suit . It doesn't take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog . Although my assumption wasn't dead on , it wasn't that much of a surprise . But the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you couldn't possibly figure the out for yourself . When Tara gets into the car accident , the naked lady 's face with the pig is clearly shown , and was easily recognizable when she shows up at the jail for the bailout . As if that wasn't enough , they later show the lady again with the pig at her house . Then it 's time to wrap up the murder story . At the end of the penultimate episode , it 's revealed that Renee is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer . In the final episode , they shove Renee being the killer in your face . Sookie remarks that it 's odd that Renee 's thoughts don't have an accent . I thought that was fine , as it adds to Renee being a fraud . But the next scene is full of incriminating evidence against Renee . They show that Renee has the tape of Maudette with the vampire and his fiancée finds a tape in one of Renee 's boxes about how to fake a Cajun accent . At this point it was just ridiculous . I mean WE GET IT ! So blah blah blah stuff happens . Bill almost kills himself while failing to save Sookie , who still manages to kill Renee . They start to set up season 2 by leaving unfinished issues . The naked pig lady and Sam have a history , Lafayette has gone missing and might have been killed . Jason is in the process of being brainwashed into being a religious nut by some anti-vampire church-which makes me care about him even less . It 's almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show . I think I just expected this show to be better . I 'm interested in seeing what happens in season 2 , but if I watch it , I 'll most likely wait for the season completion .  
  Feature of early 21 century cinema of lets pit different evil creatures and bad guys against each other . We haven't seen stuff like this since Godzilla v King Kong and the like . Always sounds great on paper when you 're splicing up and in a haze of the good stuff you have an inspired idea and see the whole playing out before you like Beethoven 's symphonies . Then you come to writing it . Great ideas like all vampires are female . Ergo hot , seductive deadly but in a way I want to perish sort of way . And all zombies are men . well thats what men are like to a woman just after shes been dumped or cheated on right ? So it all looks good up to actually making it . Then the rot starts to set in . Mosters have fight . Nothing much happens . Another fight . Philosophical noodling and cods wallop . Eureka we 've found how to win . Big fight again and the End . Sounds great doesn't it ? If it was made an indie company it would be great . But this is Hollywood with the eye on the bucks : gloss instead of what the fans want . It all could have been gore soaked beautiful .  
  I watched this movie with some friends a couple months ago , I still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity . The first few scenes alone were hilarious . I won't spoil anything for those who wish to see it , I wouldn't want to ruin the laughs . Needless to say the entire time I watched this movie I was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing . Towards the end we all got bored however , as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random wore off . There is no plot and not a trace of decent acting . The characters are about as well developed as those in a kindergarten " Learn to Read " book . They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting .  
  After watching this thing , then reading the summary on the back of the DVD , then thinking back to actual movie .. I became a bit dizzy . I thought , maybe I fell asleep and dreamed I was a down syndrome baby waltzing through a never ending forest where people drive 11 miles an hour and stop for no purpose other then occasional tasteless lesbianism . Where ( zombies ? ) come out of nowhere and ( vampires ? ) who ( seduce ? ) pure hearted citizens on their way to save the world . Neither zombie nor vampire notably encounter each other . The only fighting i remember was getting that walrus Bonny Giroux 's panties off . Coo Coo ca FAT ! All of them ! Maybe that was because we were watching it widescreen stretched and were too lazy to change it to its native resolution , but that actually made it more entertaining .. In conclusion my trailing thought thesis had more continuity , plot , character development , antagonism , subject matter , and acting then the entirety of this film . It made Bloodrayne look like Citizen F * ING KANE  
  Ghost Town starts as Kate Barrett ( Catherine Hickland ) drives along an isolated desert road , her car suddenly breaks down & she hears horses hoofs approaching .. Deputy Sheriff Langley ( Frank Luz ) of Riverton County is called in to investigate Kate 's disappearance after her father reports her missing . He finds her broken down car & drives off looking for her , unfortunately his car breaks down too & he has to walk . Langley ends up at at a deserted rundown ghost town , much to his shock Langley soon discovers that it is quite literally a ghost town as it 's populated by the ghosts of it 's former residents & is run by the evil Devlin ( Jimmie F . Skaggs ) who has kidnapped Kate for reasons never explained & it 's up to Langley to rescue her & end the towns curse .. The one & only directorial effort of Richard Governor this odd film didn't really do much for me & I didn't like it all that much . The script by Duke Sandefur tries to mix the horror & western genres which it doesn't do to any great effect . Have you ever wondered why there aren't more horror western hybrid films out there ? Well , neither have I but if I were to ask myself such a question I would find all the answers in Ghost Town because it 's not very good . The two genres just don't mix that well . There are plenty of clichés , on the western side of things there 's the innocent townsfolk who are to scared to stand up to a gang of thugs who are terrorising them , the shoot-outs in the main street , saloon bars with swing doors & prostitutes upstairs & horror wise there 's plenty of cobwebs , some ghosts , an ancient curse , talking corpses & a few violent kills . I was just very underwhelmed by it , I suppose there 's nothing terribly wrong with it other than it 's just dull & the two genres don't sit together that well . There are a few holes in the plot too , why did Devlin kidnap Kate ? I know she resembled his previous girlfriend but how did he know that & what was he going to do with her anyway ? We never know why this ghost town is full of ghosts either , I mean what 's keeping them there & what caused them to come back as ghosts ? Then there 's the bit at the end where Devlin after being shot says he can't be killed only for Langley to kill him a few seconds later , I mean why didn't the bullets work in the first place ? Director Governor does alright , there 's a nice horror film atmosphere with some well lit cobweb strewn sets & the standard Hollywood western town is represented here with a central street with wooden buildings lining either side of it . I wouldn't say it 's scary because it isn't , there 's not much tension either & the film drags in places despite being only just over 80 odd minutes in length . Forget about any gore , there a few bloody gunshot wounds , an after the fact shot of two people with their throats slit & someone is impaled with a metal pole & that 's it . I 'd have imagined the budget was pretty small here , it 's reasonably well made & is competent if nothing else . Credit where credit 's due the period costumes & sets are pretty good actually . The acting is alright but no-ones going to win any awards . Ghost Town is a strange film , I 'm not really sure who it 's meant to appeal to & it certainly didn't appeal to me . Anyone looking for a western will be annoyed with the dumb horror elements while anyone looking for a horror film will be bored by the western elements . It 's something a bit different but that doesn't mean it 's any good , worth a watch if your desperate but don't bust a gut to see it .  
  I just finished watching this movie . I was very excited since I 'm a big fan of Punk Rock , Horror films and Spoofs . I was very surprised at what I saw . I knew it was low budget , but I wasn't expecting it to be taped with a video camera . It opens with a good song and a great , very underrated band , The Horrorpops , reforming their song , Where They Wander , and promptly getting killed in various gruesome ways . It 's a great opening . But the problem is the fact that , up until the end , this was really all that the movie was . A live performance , A death . Another live performance , A death . It gets old . And there is a gross ( literally ) overuse of intestines in the death scenes . Why doesn't the killer use other body parts , like legs , or eyeballs , or brains ? Don't get me wrong , this movie has some parts that are awesome . Like the hardcore French band , known simply as BERET , the prospect of a band named Atticus , the scene containing a performance by members of the The Used and Simple Plan playing together , since neither bands had enough members to play their show , and Bowling For Soup 's Overweight and proud of it guitarist getting killed in a truly hilarious manner , that I will save for the future watchers of this movie . But the big problem I have with this movie is the at first comical , but after a while , terrible lack of acting talent in a lot of the " actors " . Especially Warped Tour creator , Kevin Lyman . He tries very hard , but I suspect that he didn't want to make the film , but was contractually obligated or something . In addition to that , the sound quality is terrible and there are no subtitles on the DVD . The Movie 's resolving plot is very hazy and very random . something about a magic sword and Lloyd Kaufman as the devil . Bottom line , this movie has a lot of good qualities , but not enough to be anywhere near a decent Horror , Music , or Comedy film . Although I have to credit it with turning me onto a few bands that I would never have listened to , otherwise . Such as Tsunami Bomb , and the Phenomonauts ( an insane , Psychobilly band ) . I recommend that you rent this movie , watch the first 10 or 20 minutes , if you like it , watch the next 20 or 30 , if you still like it , then watch on . If not , just go to the special features and watch all the music videos and live performances . They rock ! Long live Punk Rock and Horror !  
  Pathetic . This is what happens when director comes to work just because someone is paying him to . The intentions were good , great locations and settings for a film of epic proportions . But the performance , damn ! I swear , in some shots you can see extras on the background staring in the camera , or looking at the actors because no one told them what they should do when they hear " Action ! " . The battle scenes are so bad you wonder - are these people for real ? They could 've done more damage just by hugging each other . In the slow-mo scenes you can see people on battle field walking around or just standing , waving their hands . Only action in the foreground is somehow emphasized . But for what ? The story is so illogical and discontinuous , it seems like random situations in chronological order , sometimes not even that . The dialogs are dumb , the love plot is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in Hong Kong action movies . With a budget of 40 million , and you can see every dollar invested on the screen , in best case scenario , the final result of all this enormous effort is a shiny round laser disk in the thin cover placed on the shelf in video store .  
  since this is part 2 , then compering it to part one .. man that was on many places wierd .. too many time jumps etc . I have to say that I was really disapointed .. only someplaces little lame action .. and thats it .. they could have done that better ..  
  Already his first claim , that desires are always artificial , is totally fallacious . When a Jehovah Witness reject gets his own documentary on movies  or anything for that matter - it 's time for anyone to get their own . Although far , far more intelligent than , say , Paris Hilton ( I know , not too difficult ) Zizek 's mouth spews just as much baloney as hers , just a different kind . He combines the worst from both his professional worlds : psychoanalysis and philosophy . Both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b * lls * osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories , to rant without a beginning or end , and to connect concepts almost randomly , in the process misusing the English language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love . Example : there are three main Marx brothers hence what a " great " idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness , the id , the ego and the super-ego . I 'm kind of surprised he didn't play a clip from " Snowhite " and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of Gahannah ( Moslem hell ) . It 's like the premise of Schumacher 's " The Number 23 " : play with numbers long enough , and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want , even linking Ancient Greeks with Princess Di 's death . However , there is an entertainment element to TPGTC : watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun . Why watch " Cuckoo 's Nest " or any other madhouse drama when you can have Zizek for more than 2 hours ? It 's like watching an amusing train wreck . Admittedly , he is almost funny on one or two occasions . I have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie-making into an exalted intellectual social science . Giving idiotic movies like " Birds " this much thought , hence this much credit , probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave . The raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value , and the few ones that do have some intelligence don't require a shrink-turned-philosopher to draw one a map to understand them  unless one is a complete idiot . Zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies . Hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in Slovenia these days .. When Zizek showed the bathtub hole in the " Psycho " shower scene , I thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes ; how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in Janet Leigh 's blood . Or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents Leigh 's vagina , with the blood flowing into it instead of out ( as in menstruation ) , this representing some kind of " clever ( Zizekian ) irony " . Speaking of which , the real irony is that if Hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene ( and the script ) , his movies wouldn't have been the illogical , far-fetched crap that they often are . The point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about " hidden , deep meanings " . And when you add Zizek 's fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology , layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations , you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated - i . e . the easily impressionable and the gullible . Zizek utters a number of ( unintentionally ) funny things here , one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates Anthony Perkins 's cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with " the satisfaction of work , of a job well done " . Don't laugh .. Neither Hitchcock nor the writer of " Psycho " could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that Perkins might be enjoying a job well done - the cleaning of a blood-stained toilet - while they were conceiving / directing that scene . Talk about putting words into one 's ( dead ) mouth , but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to " say " . I like Zizek 's initial thoughts on Tarkovsky 's terrific " Solaris " , but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in " anti-feminism " and other nonsense into his theory . Zizek 's attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone . " I just want to play with it all day ! " Logic has its rules , and is not supposed to be raped - at least not publicly - by the likes of him . He seems to regard logic , proof , common-sense , and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys ; concepts to be either avoided , twisted to fit the end-goal , or simply annihilated . Zizek is the LSD-tripped hippie , and all his favorite movies are his own personal " 2001 " s . The fact that Zizek over-focuses on two of the most overrated directors - and ones whose films often LACK intelligence , if anything - such as Hitchcock and Lynch , only further diminishes his already low credibility . I was surprised De Palma didn't feature more prominently ; that 's another lame director who writes inept scripts . Zizek has a field day with Lynch 's incomprehensible " Lost Highway " . There are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it . Zizek 's comment that the viewer readily accepts von Trier 's laughable , " ground-breaking " physical set-up in " Dogville " made me snicker . However , Zizek doesn't only make up stuff as he goes along , he also indulges heavily in the " bleedin ' obvious " . Like all " social scientists " ( an oxymoron ) , he wraps his very trite " observations " into articulate ( if full of spitting ) and sometimes complex blankets of language . After all , sociology functions in precisely the same way : it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it 's what we already all know , but told in an eloquent way - which fools the more unobservant listener . I was half-expecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a loonie-suit ..

  Well I just gave away 95 minutes and 47 seconds that I 'll never get back on this piece of trash . I heard someone online describe this movie 's villains as " subhuman cannibals " , and I thought it was promising because I thought it would be like the Descent . WRONG ! The Descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline . These villains are totally unrealistic and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch . This movie isn't so controversial , I 've seen this level of gore in many films . This movie plain sucks . SYNOPSIS : A blonde who thinks she 's real hot ( but she isn't ) , her admirer , and her admirer 's friend ( no , I don't remember their names ) go into the woods . Their car breaks down . They are warned to leave by a man named Mark . The blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they can't find the admirer 's friend . Admirer impales his foot ( whoops ! ) . Don't worry , he is much more upset when his car won't start than when he gets impaled by nails . After a nanosecond of coaxing , the blond leaves to find help . Events ensue that I cannot remember . During this and throughout the movie , we are shown grotesque torture scenes with no substance including one that made me gag . Blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals ( even though all they are seen eating is intestines , which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual food ) . Blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard ( unsuccessfully ) to work up tears . Then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and announces she can " out think them " . Mark ( the man who warned them to leave ) has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his family . Then there is some shooting , they leave the house , the shooting continues , then a random guy shows up and says he 's been watching them . Before he is shot , we are shown an acid-trip inspired scene of more killing . The blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not help them . There 's more killing , the admirer professes his love for the blonde . Then a mysterious hand covers the camera . What does that imply ? I don't know , hopefully not a sequel .  
  I guess I only have myself to blame for the gigantic disillusion that is " Entrails of a Virgin " . You already know not to expect a cinematic masterpiece when you see a juicy and proudly promoted title like this and the first impression only gets extra confirmed when noticing the film is a mid-80 's production from Japan . Now , there are quite a lot of demented and sick filmmakers active in Japan , but Kazuo Komizu surpasses them all with his thoroughly depraved and sickening trilogy revolving on nothing but aggressive sex and the sadistic abuse of young girls . Not even attempting to tell a story , " Entrails of a Virgin " simply presents a hodgepodge of UN-arousing semi-pornographic sex and truly poor gore-effects that wouldn't even please the most undemanding fan of cheesy 80 's horror . Images of a bunch of photographers and their fashion models are inexplicably intercut with scenes of a filthy pervert having crude sex with a seemly under-aged girl . He dumps her not even a minute after climaxing ( typical ) and she begs him to stay , even if she has to share him with other women . I don't get it . Is this supposed to represent a general male fantasy ? Because it 's really clichéd and wrongful . Anyways , back to the bunch of horny photographers and docile models . Surprised by upcoming fog on their way home , the group entrenches themselves in an abandoned country house where they have more appalling sex and eventually fall victim to a ridiculous sex-demon who kills them all . The acting performances are amateurish , the dialogs inane and primitive and Komizu 's direction is weak and uninspired . I can tolerate all that , including the woman-unfriendly portrayal of sex , but I came too close to turning the film off during the indescribably mean-spirited wrestling sequence . One of the males brutally hits , kicks and throws around one of the girls and calls her a filthy whore until she literally pees her panties and cries with agony . This sequence is , in my humble opinion , the absolute low-point of Asian exploitation cinema . One to avoid and maybe even boycott .  
  The movie 's storyline is pat and quaint . Two women travel through the middle east and discover themselves . Unfortunately , if you are looking for a movie about the middle east and central Asia this is absolutely terrible . The producers of the film either did no research or were unbelievably lazy when filming it . To begin with , and most glaringly incorrect , the Nuristanis , as they were known in the thirties , and indeed since the 1890s and their forceful conversion by Abdul-Rahman Shah of Aghnaistan , were not nomads . In fact they have not been nomads since the Aryan invasions of central Asia over three milenia ago . Second , the city that is filmed as Tehran is not Tehran , which is understandable , however the geography of the area around the city could not be more strikingly DIFFERENT than the city of Tehran , which is surrounded on all side by a large mountain range , which predominates all of the cities views . Third , Persian , despite the fact it is spoken in Iran and Afghanistan , is never heard in movie . When there are native speakers who do not speak in German they speak in Arabic . The ' Persian ' guards at the border , in fact , say to each other ' Ma hadha rujal ' ( This is not a man ) and not ' in mard nist ' as it would be in Persian . Also , the love song between the Indian princess and one of the main characters is obviously in Spanish . While talking in the garden one of the main characters says that the Quran uses the words ' Ferdos ' and ' jehaan ' and makes some reference to drugs afterwords . These words certainly never appear in the Quran as they are Persian for Paradise ( indeed , Ferdos and Paradise are very distant cognates between our languages ) and ' World ' respectively , though Jehaan is admittedly close to ' Jehennan ' which is hell in Arabic . When they encounter the nomads in the desert the language spoken is also Arabic , this despite the fact that there are NO native speakers of Arabic in Iran and Afghanistan and its use is primarily religious , with some use in education at that time . When they are stopped in Iran before they reach the Afghan border the people they encounter are wholly unlike any Iranian group . Their tents are typically bedouin with carpets decorating the walls and a high profile . In Iran it is also extremely uncommon for people to wear Turbans unless they are a cleric . The language spoken is clearly Arabic from the initial greeting of ' Ahlan wa Sahlan . ' When they do reach Kabul the desert they find themselves in is sandy , totally unlike the rock dirt that is found in the arid parts of the Hindu Kush mountain range . There is an absence of the light green scrub that covers the ground in the summer and spring . The area is also not wholly consumed by the extreme mountains of the mountain range that won its name , The Indian Killers , because of its difficult and limiting ground . In short , the story line is the only thing in this movie that holds any water and it is still weak and common place . It lacks any real draw to it , being merely the tale of two women trying to learning about themselves as they get to Nuristan , however , even that is still-born and no real development is felt , leaving the characters in the end just where they were in the beginning and nothing has changed except that world war two has broken loose . In short , this is a really bad movie that I would have rated at one star except for the good footage of Bedouin and the deserts of the Levant , even if they are misnamed .  
  This budget-starved Italian action / sci-fi hybrid features David Warbeck as a Miami reporter who is chosen by the ghosts of the people of Atlantis ( ! ) to stop an evil businessman ( Academy Award nominee John Ireland ) from using a telepathic fetus grown using spores from an asteroid to rule the world . You got all that ? Despite such a loopy plot , this is actually quite a bore and the RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS sneers at it with contempt . Honestly , the most ( intentionally ) creative thing about this flick is the slight reworking of Herbie Hancock 's BEVERLY HILLS COP theme for the opening titles . The most unintentionally creative bit involves a scene in a lab that is inexplicably shown twice back-to-back . Perhaps director Alberto De Martino wanted to get all avant garde on us in the twilight of his career ? I was going to declare this Ireland 's worst film on his resume but then I saw SATAN 'S CHEERLEADERS was listed on there . I would also like to safely declare that I am probably the only person in the history of the world to do a double feature of this and Hitchcock 's VERTIGO .  
  Let 's just say I had to suspend my disbelief less for Spiderman than I did for Hooligans . That is , to say , I have less of a problem believing Toby McGuire can stick to buildings than I do Elija Wood throwing down with toughs in Manchester . I won't get into specifics , as I don't want to write a spoiler , but the idea of grown , professional , British men getting into near death scraps every weekend is , well .. funny . And this film is not . The fighting , the idea of fighting , is taken far too seriously . The gravity of the pugilism , the reverence with which the subject matter is treated becomes irritating , as it neither establishes or resolves the conflict . It seems as though the plot , with holes big enough to drive a Guiness truck through , has been slapped together with a contrived " fish out of water " theme so that viewers can gaze into Woods teary eyes as he learns how to become a man ie . hitting other young men of opposing football tastes with blunt objects and then running away as fast as he can . The characters are cartoonish , especially the Americans at Harvard . The character development and story line are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the picture . Unfortunately , the absurdity of the film doesn't reach its height until nearly the end , which by then you 'll have spent nearly two hours of your life you are never getting back . Pick up " The Football Factory " or " Fight Club " instead of this corny , and disappointing dud . It doesn't waste time with empty melodrama , the tired old " Yankee in King Aurthur 's Court , " or weepy , parables of coming of age bullsh * t . They 're just pure , dark , and clever fun ; the way violence is supposed to be .  
  I just saw this movie premiere on MTV . I must say this was extremely mediocre ( at its best ) . The dialogue doesn't explain the story very well , and I was left feeling like there were a lot of plot holes . There isn't one likable character in this adaptation due to poor acting . I just find that all of the characters are way too possessive when it comes to someone they love . Also , Cate and Heath 's love seems very incestuous . They seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers . I don't understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof . I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films , but like I said , it 's extremely hard to like any of the characters . Katherine Heigl 's performance was horrid which was a complete shocker . She was terrible at being the bitchy older sister of Edward , and there just wasn't enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me even to critique her performance . Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky , he was the only person I sympathized with . As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel , they were supposed to be our heroines , but came off as whiny and overdramatic . I just didn't enjoy this movie very much or the music in it . There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band , MxPx , but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again . MTV did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not . I just pictured something so completely different .  
  What the hell was all that about ? I saw The Matrix and was amazed . It was the most spectacular movie ever made . What ever possesed the Wachowski brothers to do this film is beyond me . There is no plot , you can't argue with that . Basically all this film was was a load of talking , and don't get me wrong , I have no problem with talky films , but all the talking in The Matrix Reloaded was a pointless load of drivvle . Then there would be a fight sequence which lasted WAY too long , then more pointless drivvle , then another fight scene that lasts too long and it all builds up to the biggest anti-climax ever . A little bearded bloke talking a load of uncomprehensible bull for 20 minutes . Also , Keanu Reeves gives his worst performance yet . I knew he wasn't a good actor but this was beyond a joke . If you watch his films in the order he was in them it would seem he got gradually worse as they went along . God knows what his performance is like in Something 's Gotta Give ! Keanu Reeves : The only plank of wood ever to become an actor . After the splendor of the first film this came as a massive dissapointment . If you haven't already seen the first film I suggest you watch it , but don't waste your time with this utter pile of turd .  
  * SPOILERS * * SPOILERS * Continued .. From here on in the whole movie collapses in on itself . First we meet a rogue program with the indication we 're gonna get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and the like . We get a guy with a retarded accent talking endless garbage , two ' ghosts ' that serve no real purpose and have no character what-so-ever and a bunch of henchmen . Someone 's told me they 're vampires ( straight out of Blade 2 ) , but they 're so undefined I didn't realise . The funny accented guy with a ridiculous name suffers the same problem as the Oracle , only for far longer and far far worse . He has a simple point about cause and effect , makes it , then continues to make it and make it until it becomes convoluted and stupid . His final line before walking off is comparable to Storm 's " do you know what happens to a toad .. " line in X-men in levels of utter bland baddness . The chocolate cake is such a lazy , pathetic cliche and Monica Bellucci as the wife does nothing other than exactly what we expect the moment we see her . And then we get another kung fu fight ! WHY ? Neo is , allegedly , The One . He can do anything . He has the ultimate power and what does he use it for . Kung bloody fu all the time . And while he can stop 1000 bullets , he still gets cut by a sword and still makes a meal of 5 undecipherable henchmen ( vampires ? ) . I wanted to see mind blowing powers . I wanted to see him do the wildest , craziest most insane s * to people because he can do anything . I got the same as before without the ' wow ' . The fabled car chase . That can't be bad . Well .. no , it 's not . It 's just not what we 've been tyold it was going to be . ALL the cool shots from this scene are in the trailer . Every one . So all possibly Wow has been taken from us so all we now get is a good chase sequence with , guess what , a kung fu fight ! OK , it 's not Neo , but you 'd have thought he 'd have explained to his closest friends about the reality of the Matrix . At least taught them something . It 's not hard . " Hey , Morpheus , don't worry about what happens to you in the matrix . It 's not real . As long as you understand that nothing 's real then nothing can really harm you . " There you go . Simple . OK , so the chase is not bad . It 's never boring and it doesn't seem like 16 minutes . It 's just so underwhelming . And still , it gets worse . The final climax to the movie is quite probably the worst imaginable . They have this whole elaborate plan that involves three crews . They then only show it sporadically between Morpheus 's over long , super preachy , monologue . To make it worse , they never clearly define what this plan that needs 3 teams is . You know basically , but you don't know who 's doing what , when , so when one crew goes down you just don't care and you don't know how this is going to affect what goes on . I 'll sum it up though , it happens so Trinity can get back into the Matrix to setup the end . That 's the only reason it happens . Which raises the question , why did they need to send 6 people originally ? Trinity gets in in five minutes by herself ! Neo 's journey to the centre of the Matrix ( so to speak ) is handled equally lazily . Ooohh ! He runs into another 100 Agent Smiths ! Woo ! That must 've taken a lot of thought . Only now they 're in a corridor so the fight has no scale and is over in a moment . Man , what a grand finale ! And then the Architect ! Remember everything I said was bad about the Oracle and the foreign guy ? Add them together and double it , that 's how truly appalling the Architect is . The only reasonable potential of him is he 's about to set up the cliffhanging climax . And then he blows it ! Let 's look at the options he gives Neo . Choose one door and all humanity dies ( except 27 ! ) . Choose the other and all humanity dies ! Considering choice is something this film tries to explore it doesn't really give it 's hero one . If he had a choice of Save humanity and the missus dies or Save the missus and kill humanity there 's the potnetial for inner torment and tension . Also , with Trinity being mid fall , the potential of a real cliffhanger that would 've made seeing the third more essential . But no . He has save no-one or save the missus . Now , the very worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo dying and then coming back to life right at the end . The year it came out everyone was so annoyed by how stupid Jar Jar was they didn't notice that the very end of The Matrix made him look him Steven Hawking . " The Oracle told me I 'd fall in love with the One , and I love you " .. Come On ! How can the whole world have missed how utterly terrible that was ? So , what do the Wachowski 's do in the sequel ? Well , they make the ending of the original look better . How ? Well , by doing almost exactly the same thing again ( only swapping characters ) only so much worse I think my f a and r keys would be worn out if I kept writing far before I got to worse . And the cliffhanger is just not really a cliffhanger . It 's a reminder . Basically , this film is just bad . I really didn't want it to be bad , but it is . Bad in just so many ways . And to make matters worse , this isn't a film with not enough budget . It 's not a film with too short a schedule . It 's not a film that 's been rushed out . It 's not a film where too much influence has come from the outside . This is exactly the film the Wachowski 's set out to make with Warner 's fortune fully behind them . And that 's what makes this so awful . At least Rancid Aluminium can say that it didn't haev enough time or money . Matrix Reloaded . The worst film ever made ? Maybe not quite . The most disappointing and defalting film ever made . Undeniably .  
  Rather then long dance sequences and close ups of the characters which made the film drag on - the movie would have been better served explaining the story and motivations of the characters . The marginalisation of Nubo , the minister , auntie , mother - and the dumbing down of the dynamic and IMPORTANT rivalry between hatsumo and mameha and hatsumo and sayuri made the movie lack any real depth . If you hadn't read the book you would not really understand why Sayuri loved the Chairman and why Mameha became her mentor at all . Visually the film was stunning - and the actors all did the best with the C rate script they were given , but that was all that was good about this movie .  
  I actually didn't enjoy this movie . I saw it at a camp , and we didn't rave about it , we laughed at it . Sure , some parts are touching , but the acting is terrible , the effects are terrible , and the whole overall movie idea is terrible ( now , I know it was based on a book which I haven't read , but I hope that the book was better than this , because frankly , I thought that this movie was very bad and boring ) . Like I said , I went to it with a bunch of people from a camp , and we were excited to be there , plus I got a caffeinated drink , but nonetheless , I struggled to stay awake . The only thing that kept me up ( other than my fear of being embarrassed once I woke up ) was the gunshots , that were quite pointless as well . I just really didn't like it .  
  I read the book and the book was fascinating . This movie , it 's direction , the screenplay , and the acting were totally insufferable . I cringed at the lack of a screenplay that could not follow the novel , a novel that has all the action , simplicity , and courage to illustrate a temerity of a great possibly fact based story . I can see why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities . Would not ever recommend this film to anyone I know . Simply , one of he worst adaptations I have seen transformed into a plot less exploration of heaven on earth . The cinematography was indeed the only highlight . But , how could that fail when filmed in an beautiful country such as Peru . To prospective viewers , do not waste your time or energy on this flop .  
  My dear Lord , what a movie ! Let 's talk about the " special effects " first . Don't get me wrong here , I am not one of those effect fanatics but I was truly thinking that superimposition was a practice of the long gone past , mainly the 60 's . So for some time I thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it . But as far as I know they did not have cell phones in the 60 's .. What I am looking for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message . Acting is secondary , effects are secondary , I do not even mind a few little inconsistencies . However , in a movies like this bad acting , incredibility , etc . add up to make a bad movie even worse - that 's what happened for me with the Celestine Prophecy . My wife said the book was actually really good and even though I am not into all that spiritual stuff I can somehow see that it can be brought across in a believable way - the movie failed to do so . There could be one single reason to watch this one though . If you really love cheesy movies it 'll be the right one for you . If the IMDb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality I MUST have rated this movie ten stars . By the way , three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies out there , like " Critical Mass " ( look up the comments on that one - hilarious ) . The Celestine Prophecy is at least entertaining to a certain degree .  
  I didn't feel as if I 'd been raped like I did with THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS , but BELLE 'S MAGICAL WORLD is still the antithesis of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST . Like CHRISTMAS , BMW hates its audience , although not to such an extreme degree . It 's ugly , uncanonical , idiotic , and the writing is horrifically bad . None of the stories work . These are not the characters we loved from BATB at all , they 're a bunch of pod people . I wanted to dissect it , but after a few minutes , I gave up , because no one in their right mind would take this claptrap seriously . What we have here are three stories . " The Perfect Word " is an overbearing , ponderous study of forgiveness . " Fifi 's Folly " only works if you can accept that Babette 's name is actually Fifi and that she 's a closet James Bond villainess and that Lumiere is an idiot concerning women . " Broken Wing " ( or " Broken Wind " as I like to call it ) is probably the most heinous of the bunch . Beast hates birds ? Since WHEN ? Don't watch this crap - every copy of this video deserves to be cremated . BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a cinematic classic , a transcendent celebration of love , art , intelligence and the human soul .  
  Eight academy nominations ? It 's beyond belief . I can only think it was a very bad year - even by Hollywood standards . With Huston as director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as leads I probably would have swallowed the bait and watched this anyway , but the Oscar nominations really sold it to me , and I feel distinctly cheated as a result . So it 's a black comedy is it ? Can anyone tell me where the humour is in Prizzi 's Honor ? It 's certainly tasteless ( the shooting in the head of a policeman 's wife is but another supposedly comic interlude in this intended farce about mafia life ) but with the exception of a joke about ' your favourite Mexican cigars ' ( which I imagine is an old joke for Americans who have been officially forbidden from buying anything Cuban for the last 50 years ) I failed to spot anything of a comic nature - and I did try . There is a lot of Mafia cliché but cliché doesn't constitute humour in my book . Is it a romantic comedy of sorts ? Never . The characters and their relationships are so completely incredible and shallow that they are on a par with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli . Is it a cleverly devised parody about the Mafia ? Not in a million years . The plot is just pointlessly absurd rather than comically absurd , and it usually just has the feel of a really bad ( and cheap ) Mafia movie . It feels more like a homage than a parody . With one-dimensional characters and little in the way of humour written for them , the actors are left doing dodgy accents and pulling faces . Well it isn't enough ; even when the face is being pulled by that master of the comic facial expression , Jack Nicholson ( repleat with puffed up top lip .. now is that meant to be a parody of Brando 's padded jowls in The Godfather ? .. Oh ! Who cares ? .. all I know is , it isn't funny ) . Throw in some slow , plodding direction ( this film drags on for 2 hours ) , some hopelessly daft and clichéd dialogue such as ; " You remember the Camora ? Well we 're far bigger , we 'll track you down wherever you go " , and clichéd mannerisms and you 'll be reaching for that fast forward button before you can say " capiche ? " . Prizzi 's Honor is far from being Huston 's " masterpiece " and is rather a very poor last work . It 's definitely one work in the great director 's canon that should be given a concrete overcoat and tossed into the Hudson River .  
  Maria Bello doesn't seem to care what people think of her choices in movie roles . Again she chooses a very difficult and not popular movie to star in . Maybe she needs those movies , to get off the sugar coated ( aka " Hollywood " ) ones she does here and then ( Coyote Ugly and of course Mummy 3 ) . While I think fails to achieve what it sets out to do ( I won't spoil that ) , Maria Bello is as great as in her other independent / small movies she stars in . It 's her performance that elevates this movie . This combined with the strange subject matter almost did the trick for me . But in the end ( and even if I try to overlook some flaws , like bad pacing and dramaturgy ) , the movie is still too long  
  When I was at the movie store the other day , I passed up Blonde and Blonder , but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie . Who knows ? I mean , I 'm sure most people bashed Romy and Michelle before they saw it , Blonde and Blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up . But when I started watching it : Executive Producer Pamela Anderson , wow , I knew I was in for something scary . Not only that , but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness : Pam Anderson and Denise Richards , not to offend them , but they were not aging well at all and they 're playing roles that I think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20 's , not their 40 's . The story was just plain bad and obnoxious . Dee and Dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde 's , they really don't have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world , it 's just really sad . But when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins , the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their " ignorance is bliss " attitudes . They are set up to make a " hit " on a guy , and they think they 're just going to " show him a good time " , but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls . Denise and Pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before . I know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy , but it was more than stupid , it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary . Would I ever recommend this ? Not in a million years , the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as " sex kittens " , it 's more a sign of desperation and Blonde and Blonder is a huge blonde BOMBshell . 1/10  
  Visually cluttered , plot less , incredibly mind-numbing rubbish . Not even close to Greenaway 's better work . Avoid at all costs ! The overlapping ' split screen ' effects do nothing more than confuse , the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the ' artistic ' composing of images is pretentious in the extreme . There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film ; even the nudity is incredibly unerotic , which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very boring . Plus , how anyone can say that the acting of Ewen MacGregor is brilliant is beyond me . He showed more ability in the Star Wars series , and that 's saying something . I 've not been so unimpressed with a film since I saw ' Darby O'Gill and the Little People ' !  
  This is easily the worst Presley vehicle ever , which would bring us pretty close to the worst film ever made . It is measurably worse than even the revolting " Happy Ending " song at the end of " It Happened At The World 's Fair " , and here I thought that moment when Elvis buys all of the vendor 's balloons for his girl , and then the balloon vendor gets jiggy to the marching band was the epitome of bad cinema and could not be topped . I usually enjoy the random Elvis flick if for no other reason but the memories of a time when we were innocent enough to sit through it . This one , however , ought to be called " Live a Little , Wish You Were Dead a Little " , and makes " Stay Away Joe " look like Olivier playing Othello . Here , Elvis plays Greg , who is essentially a hippie free-lance photographer except for the Establishment haircut . After a fun morning of reckless driving , he ends up at the beach where he is abducted by a woman who 's name changes depending on the scene and who is speaking to her . Clearly Michele Carey was selected for her resemblance to and ability to mimic Elizabeth Taylor ( if I watched this without my glasses , I would have thought it was late 1960 's Liz playing the female lead ) . She sics her dog on Elvis until he runs into the water and catches convenient movie pneumonia , then she keeps him doped up out of consciousness in her beach pad so long he loses his job and his apartment so she moves his stuff into her house before he awakens without even telling him ( the audience does not know about it either , until Elvis tries to go back to work and his boss has him beaten up for no reason except he deserved it for making this movie , and tries to go home and finds some hateful woman in a slip living in his house ) . Rather than having her arrested for kidnapping , larceny and assault , he goes out and gets two jobs to repay the back rent Miss Crazy Pants had to spring for when stealing all of his belongings . Job one is working for Don Porter at a Playboy type magazine , job two is upstairs working for Rudy Vallee at a snobby fashion magazine . I think the two-job shuffling is supposed to be the comedy , too bad it isn't the least bit funny , unless you 'd laugh the 100th time you saw someone run up and down stairs in fast-motion to silly music . The predominate obstacle that keeps Greg from falling for his abductor is her other love interest , the dreadfully miscast Dick Sargent ( let 's face it , either Porter or Vallee , even given their advanced ages in 1968 , would have made far more believable competitors for Miss Crazy 's affections ) . There are a variety of uninteresting and unfunny twists and turns , I kept waiting for something , anything to happen that would make all of this make sense . It never did . Entertainment totals approximately three minutes and is comprised of Elvis ' rendition of " A Little Less Talk " ( which I can listen to on CD without this painful movie inflicted upon me ) and a funny five second bit where Elvis flops on the couch and Crazy Pants has apparently disassembled it so it flies all to pieces when he lands on it . That 's it , folks , busted furniture , the only laugh in this entire film . No amount of mod sixties clothing , music , or décor can salvage this high-heaven stinker and it should be avoided at all costs . Viewing this can create an unnatural desire on the part of the audience toward the self-infliction of grave bodily harm .  
  Ok , I 've seen plenty of movies dealing with witches and the occult but this one was just plain weird . This movie starts out as this cult of witches led by a really bad Orson Wells playing the staring role ( couldn't they have gotten somebody that looked and acted more like a Satanist ) he just did not belong in this movie at all . But anyhow , the coven takes a new member and stabs a doll that resembles somebody and makes her have a miscarrage . The lady that had the miscarrage and her husband go off to a place called Lillith on busness and the lady meanwhile is seeing an image of her sister or whoever it is calling to her and warning her to stay away from there and to never use her powers there or she will die . The couple after they get settled down in the strange town discover that all the inhabitants are all witches and she becomes nosey and afraid of all of her neighbors and friends . Then strange things start to happen as the lady discovers a funeral taking place on a hill that suddenly disapears ( that was creepy ) as well as seeing the little boy belonging to Orson Wells at the playgroud that he later asks the lady to help him bring back to life . The lady soon tries to escape the town but only to find herself traped by it 's inhabitants and powers and finds herself ignoring all of what the spirit tries to warn her about . This movie is ok , it 's has it 's moments of suspense but it really could have done much better than to have Orson in there .  
  As usual , I am making a mad dash to see the movies I haven't watched yet in anticipation of the Oscars . I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley . I can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has . There is no story ! A group of guys meander around Iraq . One day they are here diffusing a bomb . Tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside , by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire . No wait here they are back in Bagdad . There is no cohesive story at all . The three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures . By that I mean , we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying . We have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe . And then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn't follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers DVDs . What do you think is going to happen ? Well , do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn't follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways ? Why yes ! Do you think the Iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy ? Why yes ! There is no story here . The script is juvenile and predictable ! The camera is shaken around a lot to make it look " artsy " . And for all of you who think this is such a great war picture , go rent " Full Metal Jacket " , " Deerhunter " or " Platoon " . Don't waste time or money on this boring movie !  
  Is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor ? The answer is Yes ; one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture . The premise is not too bad - a naive front man for an illegal business - but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay and just does not work . Was this considered a good ' B ' in 1942 ? Hard to imagine . The only positive aspect of the picture is the cast , which contains several well-known faces from the ' 30 's and ' 40 's , such as Warren Hymer , Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong ( I always dismiss Richard Cromwell as the weakling who got Gary Cooper killed in " Lives of a Bengal Lancer " , so I wasn't counting him ) . Can't recommend this one and gave it a rating of 3 - if you have a choice , get a root canal .  
  This movie wasn't that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original . It 's directed by Martin Kitrosser of Friday the 13th fame . The acting is very bad indeed , but the gore and special effects help make it interesting . Thats one thing I like about Screaming Mad George ( make up effects artist for the film ) , his effects are so off-the-wall and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy they 're gonna get . The movie isn't really all that gory , but there is an EXTREMELY nasty eyeball-munching scene in the middle involving a toy maggot ( what ! ? ! ) Mickey Rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably wasn't too enthusiastic about but needed the money at the time , possibly ? If you liked the weirdo 4th installment ( my favorite of all 5 ) , you 'll probably like this one . I liked it better than the Matrix ! Enjoy .  
  Warped take on the Pinocchio theme , and set during the Christmas season ( .. after the previous entry abandoned ties to Christmas ) has booby-trapped toys sent to murder a child ( .. yet through this , other victims are accidentally harmed in the process ) perhaps by a toy maker 's " son " . Screaming Mad George was responsible for the killer toys ( .. including a larvae which enters a victim 's mouth and out his eye , another where soldier toys actually shoot real bullets at a babysitter after her boyfriend was practically strangled by a severed hand toy , operating from a remote control ) . The little target is a mute child named Derek ( William Thorne ) whose stepdad was murdered by a red ball with extending arms that ensnare his face , causing him to land on a fireplace poker . Mother Sarah ( Jane Higginson ) worries about her son 's mental state , figuring his reluctance towards opening presents or , more importantly , talking , derives from watching her husband 's horrific murder . Derek 's real father , Noah ( Tracy Fraim ) fears for his son't safety , and informs , reluctantly , his ex-girlfriend Sarah that the local toymaker , Joe Petto ( Mickey Rooney ) once was arrested for setting traps in toys to harm kids due to the loss of an unborn child when his wife was killed in a car crash .. kind of a retaliation in saying that if he couldn't have a son , then others shouldn't either . Still quite a heavy drinker ( .. often seen swigging Jack ) , Petto seems to have set aside his feelings towards kids , but his creepy son Pino ( Brian Bremer ) hasn't and Derek he harbors angst towards . Why ? You 'll soon understand . Pretty disappointing special effects and rather goofy premise . Rooney 's name adds an allure to the film , gaining it a notoriety , but his histrionics can only help so much . Attractive lead actress Higginson ( Slaughterhouse ) and Fraim as the man who re-enters her life aren't so bad , but the lame plot that develops is hard to take seriously . I 'm guessing that 's the point , but Rooney has no reason to be in such a film as this .. he has no room to bring any personality to his toymaker other than rage and desperation , quite volatile , barely holding himself together as he explodes in anger towards Pino , when not downing liquor . Bremer is appropriately weird and " robotic " as Pino , longing to have Sarah as his mama . The practical effects used during the attacks on victims are rather unconvincing .. Screaming Mad George 's work with Savage Steve Holland was far more effective than what we see in this film . The sex everyone talks about isn't as gratuitous as many would have you believe ( .. I can't even recall any nudity ) . Probably the best of the numerous sequels greenlighted , but that 's not exactly an endorsement . I 'm pretty sure written on paper , this was an entertaining concept , the idea of spoofing Pinocchio using horror elements , but the result doesn't exactly blow you away .  
  Went to watch this movie expecting a ' nothing really much ' action flick , still got very disappointed . The opening scene promised a little action with a tinge of comedy . It keeps you hooked for the first half coz till then you are expecting that now its time for the action to kick in . Well , nothing of that sort happens . The movie drags and the ending just thumps you down to a point that you get annoyed . Wonder what was the director thinking . Made no sense watsoever . The movie lacked in all aspects , had no real storyline and it seemed very hollow , even if " Rambo " was in it , I don't think he could have helped the rating at all . There is simply no logic to the movie . A perfect way to waste your time and money . By far the most irritating movie i have ever seen and i am sure there will b others who 'll have the same viewpoint after enduring it . Definitely not for people who have a little movie sense left in them .  
  The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance - what a laughable title , it 's so utterly misleading . It 's not surprising that the film-makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie . The story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island . Very little happens in this film . And when something does wake the viewer from his stupor , it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by a hopeless group of voice-artists . These guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of remedial-level morons . It really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal . But the voice-artists cannot be blamed for the script . It 's a travesty . Unintentionally funny at best , pathetic at worst . The story in general is , to say the least , uneven . The women characters are particularly idiotic ; the men are either creepy or tedious . The whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience . It doesn't remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders ( finally ) start happening , they all occur off screen . All we get is a few half-hearted severed head shots . A few people have said that this movie is a giallo . I cannot agree less with this opinion . Anyone who enjoys Italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it . It 's basically a soft-core porn film with a horror angle . But it 's not very erotic either . I can't recommend this to anyone .  
  I read comments about this being the best Chinese movie ever . Perhaps if the only Chinese movies you 've seen contained no dialogue , long drawn-out far-away stares and silences , and hack editing , then you 're spot on . Complicated story-line ? Hardly . Try juvenile and amateurish . Exquisite moods and haunting memories ? Hardly . Try flat-out boring and trite . This was awful . I could not wait for it to be over . Particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of " How are you ? I 'm fine . Are you sure ? Yes . " Wow ! What depth of character . I guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for them . As a huge fan of many Chinese , Japanese and Korean films , I was totally disappointed in this . Even Zhang 's sentimentally sappy " The Road Home " was better than this .  
  Wow-this one sucks . I 'm gonna sum it up as quickly as possible .   A count invites 4 naive sluts back to his castle . A bunch of nothing happens for a long time . Some lame and un-erotic soft-core sex scenes happen . Some girls get their heads cut off ( off-screen ) - The End . The only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes , some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue , and a few brief nudie shots . And believe me-those things are not enough to redeem the 90-minutes of tedium that this film is . In fact-the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits-and again-this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage . As everyone else has noted - the title of the film is completely nonsensical-as there 's absolutely no bloodsucking , nor dancing of any sort in the film at all . It may as well have been called ' The Goat-Raper Leads the Circle-Jerk'-and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film . An accurate title would have been ' 90 Minutes of Torture'-another alluring title that would have at least been truthful .. for the viewer . Honestly-the trailer that 's on the disc shows all the best parts ( and i use the term ' best ' extremely loosely .. ) so I highly suggest watching that instead if you 're still curious .  I can't imagine anyone liking this wreck of a film-please take my advice and leave this one on the shelf . 2/10   
  What a great actor to have in such an awful story .. The film and its production , however , is quite good , even though set in London but with exteriors in Bristol . No matter  see one cathedral , you 've seen ' em all , sort of . The story however .. is about a man born with the power to wreak death and destruction upon anybody and anything , should he so wish . With just a passing reference to true life instances of telekinesis , the narrative builds a picture of a man misused and misjudged as a boy , a teenager and finally as a man ; so much so , in fact , that he exacts vengeance at will , literally . Over time , he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the lot  just by thinking about it ! The trouble with the narrative , however , is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data about strange mental powers and merge it all with quasi-religious claptrap to produce a hodge-podge theory about it all . Mixing fact and fantasy in this fashion rarely works  and I 'm afraid Richard Burton had to overact awfully on some occasions when trying to sound convincing . His very best scene , however , is when he gave his wife and her lover a verbal pasting as they left his home : sharp , witty and deadly dialog , delivered as only Burton could . A good supporting cast helps to make things look and sound a lot better , though , beginning with Lino Ventura , whom I last saw in Garde A Vu ( 1981 ) , as Inspector Brunel ; Harry Andrews as Assistant Commissioner ; the much under-rated Lee Remick as Dr Zonfeld ; Derek Jacobi as a publisher , Towney , and a few other well known character actors . I liked the way the story was presented , as flashback within flashback to fill in the back story and thus solve the immediate mystery of the attempted murder of Morlar ( Richard Burton ) , the writer with the killer disposition . Up till that point , it was a good piece of visual detective work by Brunel and his English sidekick . Still , it was very predictable as it became quickly very obvious to me about the identity of the would-be murderer . Then , they went and spoilt it all in the last fifteen minutes . If you want a clue about what that is , think Samson and Delilah ( 1949 ) , from the illustrious Cecil B . de Mille , and how Samson got the bad guys in the end . And , the very last scene is just plain stupid . Why ? Because there are at least a hundred ways that Morlar 's rampaging could have been stopped , absolutely . Shame , actually , because this could have been a lot better story and movie . I guess Burton really needed the money . If you 're Burton fan , then spend the time to see that scene I mentioned above . Otherwise , don't bother .  
  Was there a single positive to this film ? Critics who knew nothing of video games could spot the gaming errors made . No damage taken with damage clearly visible towards the beginning being a primary example . And I may have missed something , but wasn't Super Mario Bros . 3 suppose to be a game that had never played before ? Well if that IS the case , and I did not miss anything .. how did Fred Savage 's character , and even the girl , know so much about the game already ? We 're talking things that some people don't know about by their second or third play-through . Beyond the factual and gaming errors there is the general low quality of the film itself . Nothing here is honestly very memorable . The kid wasn't even that good at playing video games in the footage they showed . A lot of kids I knew way back in those days were significantly more experienced . On top of all this the acting and storyline are just mediocre at their strongest points . The characters are bland and completely uninteresting , the ' Wizard ' ( the youngest child ) is a very silent , completely dry child cliché of a little kid who almost never talks because of a trauma . It isn't that this is unrealistic , it 's the fact that it had to be thrown into the movie to actually even begin to form a plot that would exceed even 30 minutes . Honestly , the only value that is to be found here is that of a nostalgic nature . If you grew up with this movie you 're going to like it whether it was good or not . It was about kids playing video games , and at the time you saw it you likely had an obsession with the NES as well . But unless you loved it as a kid there just isn't anything that 's going to keep you interested , and very little that will prevent you from turning it off . No sir , I didn't like it .  
  If you are planning to rent or buy this movie don't . It 's the worst thing I have ever seen . I would comment on it more but It has been 10 years since I saw it and have blanked all of it from my mind . Save yourself some time money and well being and stay far far away .  
  This was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting ( mainly from the supporting characters ) . The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the film itself .. Hugh Laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the Samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool . The movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainment . If you have never seen Rio , or the inside of a British bank , this film is for you . 2 out of 10 .  
  One of , if not the worst film to come out of Britain in the 80s . This tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who ' seduces ' two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem it . In turns gratuitous , puerile , uncouth and unrealistic , this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny , provocative , intellectual and controversial . Perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of George Costigan , Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script . It 's no surprise that this was the late Andrea Dunbar 's only work to make it onto the screen . Complete and utter rubbish on every level .  
  " Die Sieger " was highly recommended to be one of the few good action movies made in Germany . I watched it last night and I must admit , that I am deeply disappointed . If that is supposed to be " the last best hope " for entertaining and challenging German action cinema , well then there is not much left . " Die Sieger " tries to be sexy , daring and furious but it is nothing of that kind . The characters are wooden and stereotype and whenever they do something unexpected ( which doesn't happen too much ) the act against their nature . That makes it hard - for me almost impossible - to follow them or even identify with them . Most of all I think the film is very bad cast . There is not one character in whom I believe . Maybe the superior officer at the SWAT unit - but that 's about it . Those people that try to look like or act like special units , like elite cops - I don't believe them . Not for a second . The story is not so bad after all . But I think it 's badly told . You don't get to know the bad guy at all - for example . And when after a " very dark " show down Karl Simon ( the good guy ) asks his already dead opponent " why ? .. what for ? " I did ask myself that very same question , knowing , that Dominik Graf wouldn't have the answer . I sincerely hope - no - I believe that Germany can do better , even with action films .  
  What starts out as an interesting story quickly disintegrates into nothing . Don't bother watching to the end hoping for an explanation of what is stalking the visitors , there is no ending . No explanation , no resolution , zip . This could have been a good movie it they had purchased an entire script .  
  Keanu Reeves stars as a friend of a popular high school student who suddenly commits suicide .. he and his friends go through emotional turmoil and share their reactions to this horrible incident .. Good acting by Reeves and a young Jennifer Rubin .. but on the whole is a little too much .. 4 of 10  
  I saw the movie late one night on cable and could not believe how bad it was . I usually enjoy bad movies , but this one was so revolting that it wasn't even entertaining . Some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music which is constantly playing throughout the movie , the hideous special effects ( when someone is shot with a laser gun they turn neon green and promptly disintegrate ) , and the disgusting acting . The acting , in fact , is what I feel steals the show . I didn't recognize any of the actors in the movie , and I hope that I never have to see any of them again . Overall , I recommend renting this movie ( if you can find it ; I can't imagine a video store carrying this garbage ) just so that you can learn to appreciate quality films after seeing this trash .  
  This self-indulgent mess may have put the kibosh on Mr . Branagh 's career as an adapter of Shakespeare for the cinema . ( Released 4 years ago ; not a peep of an adaptation since . ) I just finished watching this on cable - holy God , it 's terrible . I agree with the sentiment of a reviewer below who said that reviewing something so obviously and sadly awful is an ungenerous act that comes across as shrill . That being said , I 'll take the risk , if only because * Love 's Labour 's Lost * is the perfect reward for those who overrated Mr . Branagh 's directorial abilities in the past . Branagh has always been a pretty lousy director : grindingly literal-minded ; star-struck ; unforgivably ungenerous to his fellow actors ( he loves his American stars , but loves himself more , making damn sure that he gets all the good lines ) . Along those lines , the sad fact remains that * Love 's Labour 's Lost * is scarcely worse than the interminable , ghastly , bloated * Hamlet * from 1996 . In fact , this film may be preferable , if only because it 's about 1/3 the length . Branagh decided it would be a good idea to update this bad early work of Shakespeare 's to the milieu of Cole Porter , George Gershwin , Fred Astaire , yada yada . So he sets the thing in 1939 , leaves about an eighth of the text intact in favor of egregious interpretations of Thirties ' standards ( wait till you see the actors heaved up on wires toward the ceiling during " I 'm In Heaven " ) , and casts actors not known for their dancing or singing ( himself included ) . The result is a disaster so surreal that one is left dumbfounded that they just didn't call a horrified stop to the whole thing after looking at the first dailies . I don't even blame the cast . To paraphrase Hamlet , " The screenplay 's the thing ! " NO ONE could possibly come off well in this hodge-podge : the illustrious RSC alumni fare no better than Alicia Silverstone . Who could possibly act in this thing ? Branagh 's first mistake was in thinking that * Love 's Labour 's Lost * was a play worth filming . Trust me , it isn't . It 's an anomaly in the Bard 's canon , written expressly for an educated coterie of courtiers - NOT the usual audience for which he wrote . Hence , there 's a lot of precious ( and TEDIOUS ! ) word-play , references to contemporary scholastic nonsense , parodies of Lyly 's * Euphues * . . . in other words , hardly the sort of material to appeal to a broad audience . Hell , it doesn't appeal to an audience already predisposed to Shakespearean comedy . The play cannot be staged without drastically cutting the text and desperately " updating " it with any gimmick that comes to hand . Which begs the question , Why bother ? Branagh 's second mistake was in thinking that Shakespeare 's cream-pie of a play could be served with a side-order of Gershwin 's marmalade . Clearly the idea , or hope , was to make an unintelligible Elizabethan exercise palatable for modern audiences by administering nostalgic American pop culture down their throats at the same time . But again , this begs the question , Why bother ?  
  I 'm a big fan of movies that make you think . I 'm still thinking long and hard about this one , fully seven minutes after the credits have rolled . What 's really confounding my neurons is the attempt to fathom the relevance to the plot of the naked girlie fondling her slick oily body , made extra-tacky by being filmed on cheap video . This happens three times and I was certain it would be explained in the end . I put my trust in the film-makers that this lurid attempt to lure viewers would be justified . It was not . The movie has to be the most apathetic I 've come across in the genre . The sets look like a cross between a 1970s Dr Who set and someone 's ill-formed idea of a sponge-painted living room . The lighting is unimaginative ( if your sets are going to be that bad , at least film them in semi-darkness to hide the plasterboard and create some ambiance ) . Of the abducted quartet , the girl stands out as being particularly lame , but none of them is given a personality . The aliens ' plans for world domination are just plain silly - all they need is a birth control pill and their problems are solved . Most of the movie consists of people running down corridors . Yes , it really is that exciting . The " ray gun " special effect is .. curious , to say the least ( what use is a weapon that takes a 15-second concentrated blast to kill , and even then the guy comes back for more ? ) . The script is like a bad episode of The A-Team , and the ladies ' hairstyles come from the same era , so they look like school teachers instead of an advance team of murderous alien invaders . When we finally get to see what the aliens really look like , they 're in suspended animation and never even get out of their boxes . The resolution of the story - traitor alien simply has a few words with invading fleet commander and without a second thought he heads home - is truly the sign of a writer who 's never had an idea more complex than a Saturday morning cartoon ( I mean the bad ones with no plot , action , or characterization ) in his or her life . But seriously , what is with the naked chick ? ! Was it really just so they could justify putting flesh on the DVD cover to boost sales ?  
  Priyadarshan - whenever a person heard his name , his first thought would be ' comedy ' . That is what this man is known for , or rather , was known for . After giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like Hungama , Hera Pheri and Hunchul , his train derailed slowly with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I can't recollect for now . Now with hideous films like Dhol , the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be - ' torture ' . Dhol is a mixture of bad , unfunny toilet jokes , somewhat of drama , poor suspense and idiocracy . The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny , though not witty , and secondly , except for Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandma , the acting was decent . Speaking of the acting , I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top ( if you compare them with the others in the movie ) , then came Tusshar Kapoor , then Tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above . The flaw in Kunal Khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting . The grandma , firstly resembled a ghost , plus she was not funny at all but rather silly . The plot was the same , seen before one . Four boys behind girls and in need of money , but with a few twists . There is a ' bad ' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb . And at last , the good wins over the bad and everything is fine . The idea of having a Dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty . The worst thing about the movie is its length . After an hour or so , you get exhausted and want to leave the theater . But being a critic , it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie . THe movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are perennial just at a different place . If your mother-in-law has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything , then send her for this movie and have fun . 3 out of 10 .  
  Saw this piece of work at a film fest in CA . My god , what was the director thinking ? Film professors should use this film as a case study on what NOT to do when making a short film . First off , this project makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . The film takes place partially in " The Waystation " , some stupid vapid bar in the middle of nowhere , where nothing really takes place . THe acting is beyond bad . So bad in fact that I almost thought it was a comedy . The lead actress Julia Reading is a step below the acting in most amateur porn films . There is one or two decent performances , including the guys who played Jacob and Fenner but it 's like the director had no clue on how to work or use his thespians . The only thing worse than the acting was the dialogue , which bordered on absurd . The writer ( whom I assume is also the director ) writes each character like they are auditioning for a comic book villain . The overall production value is pretty good , but to be honest , with a film this bad it 's easy to overlook it . The production design is pretty good , although the Waystation looks like any ordinary bar . The costumes and make-up are okay , and I understand the production was working with a low budget . It 's just when the characters speak , or they try and push the plot forward , the film unravels into a muck of crap . As I 've said , this film is god awful . It 's like the director / writer watched a lot of sci-fi films and threw all the parts he liked into a blender and came up with this . My only hope is that he used other people 's money on this , because if he used his own , he 's a total sucker .  
  I just blew four dollars renting this movie ! Why Alliance Atlantis would promote such a poor excuse for a film is beyond me . But even more surprising was the reasonably good reviews that a couple of Canadian newspaper critics gave this film . I 'm tired of our media justifying a film simply because it 's Canadian and low budget . It 's like they expect Canadian films to be lousy , so they give it a good review regardless . Now about the movie : The acting was below average ( with the exception of the lead male character , who was actually pretty good ) . The film quality was poor , which I guess could be expected from the extremely low budget . The script was absolutely horrendous . An example is the story , which revolves around one of the lead characters , a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients so that she can recruit him to fix and steal bicycles for her gang , whose only purpose is to randomly destroy SUV 's . Supposedly many of her gang members ' bicycles are destroyed in these activities ( I don't know how she can't afford to just buy new ones , since she is supposed to be this big drug dealing connection from Vancouver to Toronto ) . Anyway , the point of the story ( which isn't revealed until well over halfway through the movie ) is that the drug dealer plans to firebomb buildings in the Toronto area to attempt to make houses more affordable - as no one will want to live in the area . - Need I say more . Shame on the Toronto Film Festival for accepting such a film , Telefilm for supporting it , and the Globe and Mail and Georgia Straight newspapers for giving such biased reviews . A film shouldn't get special treatment just because it 's Canadian !  
  Without reiterating what was said above about this movie , I would like to add that I was looking forward to watching this film .. the cast / location and the work of the excellent director Michael Winterbottom etc .. It had a vague shadow of ' Don't look Now ' about the storyline from the beginning . A stay in different surroundings ( Italy again ) to dim the heartbreak of loss .. or perhaps that 's how I saw it ? So consequently I sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign European country .. and I sat there and sat there .. and guess what ? nothing actually happens ! and I mean nothing ! You are not even given the chance to get into the characters as they are so 1 dimensional and vacuous .. You are led to believe from the pace of the movie that something was going to happen to turn the whole film on it 's head .. The eldest daughters flirtation with the local vespa boys , had great scope to take the movie in another direction , the youngest daughters visions of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and pointless exercise , the fathers attempts at being seduced by one of his female students felt ridiculous given his age . It felt as if the script had a last recall made where they decided at the last minute to eradicated any guts to the story and went for paring it down to a bare minimum to no effect . When the credits started to roll ( unexpectedly ) you can't help but feel robbed of your time spent sat watching this pile of rubbish .  
  So so special effects get in the way of recapturing the interesting relationship between Uncle Martin and Tim O'Hara that we remember from the TV series . And what was with the suit ? Annoying !  
  After watching Revolt Of The Zombies starring future Academy Award winner Dean Jagger I was left with one burning question . How was a society that created these ultimate warrior fighting machines ever defeated in the first place ? That 's the question you 'll be pondering if you take time to watch Revolt Of The Zombies . Towards the end of World War I , the French discover a cult from occupied Cambodia where these undead creatures who cannot be stopped with bullets form a brigade of monks who go over the top and dislodge the Hun . This scares the living fecal matter out of everyone concerned so an international expedition is formed to find out destroy the secret of these zombies so no nation can get their hands on it and rule the world . But we 've got some dissent in those ranks . First is Snidely Whiplash villain Roy D'Arcy who murders the Buddhist monk who has the secret and second is Dean Jagger . Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac as we all know and he 's determined to woo Dorothy Stone away from rival Robert Noland . I think you 've got some idea how this comes out , especially since a race of zombies didn't conquer the world for one country . Dean Jagger as he got the Oscar for Twelve O'Clock High must have shuddered every time he thought about this film and the awful dialog he tried to give a spark of sincerity to . Moral of the story , you might make an ultimate warrior with the zombie potion and the zombie chant , but you can't make an ultimate love slave .  
  As a spiritualist and non Christian . I thought i really was going to be holding onto my faith , but what a load of i seers . I thought the film would have great arguments , but only got one sided views from Atheists and Jews ? And who are all these street people he 's interviewing who don't know the back of their arm from their head . Where are the proper theologians and priests and stuff he could have got arguments from . Not retired nuts who wrote books and finished their studies in 1970 . Personally this DVD was a waste of time and not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or if i should or should not believe because an anti-Christ told me so . Please to think he came up with the conclusion of not finding God because his own ego and demons got the better of him . No im not going to say the movie was stunning to help atheists reading this feel better about themselves . But if you really want to show the world you care about us poor souls who believe in Jesus then entice us with your worth , not your beating off the drums .  
  The photography on the DVD is so dark I thought the screen had died . I think I missed seeing half of the movie . Still , it was poorly crafted and not interesting . I did not find the story related to the title " The Black Widow " . I was hoping for a mystery or a thriller but did not get involved enough to care after the first few frames . I rented the movie especially for Willem Dafoe and was sad it wasted his talent . I do not believe Giada Colagrande has studied movie making long enough to develop a major motion picture . She is attractive and might develop into an actor but she took on too many tasks in this movie . Although they are married in real life , they lack chemistry on the screen . Their relationships did not seem believable . I do not understand why the other characters were even introduced into the plot .  
  This wilfully bizarre adaptation of Borges short story is typical Cox . His strong visual sense is , as usual , undone by the appalling half baked acting of most of the cast . The film is definitely in the surreal tradition of Bunuel 's Mexican period , and looks at times like a poor man 's take on Lars Von Trier 's Elements of Crime . Cox 's apparent preference for single takes , jump cuts , and ambient sound recording all work against the film 's effectiveness . Worth a look but ultimately disappointing .  
  From the beginning of the movie I had a feeling like its a movie about another Jason 's from Friday the 13th . And It is .. Dispute that the movie starts interesting . But as the times goes by its just a pointless movie about muted , supernatural , silent serial killer . I mean he goes under the guy 's bed without making any sound , not seen by anyone . He was supposed to be blind after failed execution but he walks and kills people like he used to . I 'm tired of it . For me it 's all over the same thing . In another words - unreal . Too many mistakes and confusing information . Well scene with tide up woman looked impressive but just at first time : } For that and for intriguing intro 2 stars .  
  This film is not deserved of the next few minutes I will spend criticizing it , but I know many people , like myself , rely on IMDb . com to assist in deciding on films . For that reason alone , I am writing this . " Live Feed " is like an Asian version of 1976 's " The Incredible Torture Show " ( aka " Blood Sucking Freaks " ) http : / ww . imdb . com / title / tt0077247 / . Torture , dismemberment , murder , cannibalism .. sure , it 's all here along with a third-grade script , pathetic acting , and a perverted failure of an attempt at black comedy . The film takes place in China , yet everyone speaks English . There is an abundance of girls in the film who are horrified by the butchering of dogs in a marketplace , yet are sexually excited about entering a porno parlor . One gal who is disgusted by the filth in a restroom stall moments later is still there having at it with her friends boyfriend ( how he even got in there might be the only engaging thing about this whole film . ) The film is absolutely awful , even for a B-movie . Even if you were to download it for free , it would be an insult to your hard drive .  
  Some gorehound-friends recommended " Live Feed " to me , and basically I can't really complain as the film certainly does deliver copious amounts of gross smut and buckets full of sleaze , but it is of course not a very good film . More than obviously cashing in on the latest trend in horror cinema , the so-called Torture Porn , Ryan Nicholson tries to surpass every other film in this sub genre ( and that includes the role models " Hostel " and " Saw " ) with its sick & twisted make-up effects and thoroughly depraved shots of naked co-eds tried up , suffering and begging for their lives . There 's no actual plot to describe . Five utterly brainless twenty-something friends take a trip to Asia . One of them has Asian roots , but other than that I don't really know why they opted to travel there instead of to Cancun . They 're clearly not interested in the continents culture and even cause a hectic scene when they witness a local butchering a cute puppy dog on the market . The quintet subsequently dives into the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan . A simply apology clearly doesn't suffice , as the gangster follow them into an adult theater and gradually subject all of them to vicious torture . One girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake shoved down her throat ; yikes . " Live Feed " is surprisingly boring despite of all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values are quite difficult to overlook , even if you 're used to watching independent fan-boy trash cinema like this . The fat bloke depicted on the cover , an oriental S & M executioner , is admittedly quite cool and he 's also the most talented of the whole bunch , because he at least keeps his mouth shut the entire time . I wouldn't exactly recommend this pile of filth , but hey , if you like loud & hideous metal music , nauseating torture footage and dim-witted losers , go right ahead and watch !  
  Elephants Dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community . And while it was a very interesting idea in concept , in reality it has failed miserably . The film is beautifully rendered , which is probably the only redeeming factor . A huge problem with them , however , is the vast overruse of light bloom . It 's horrible , although I guess it helps give the film a dreamlike quality . One thing to note is the terrible voice acting . While Proog 's voice actor is at least semi-competent , Emo 's voice actor is HORRIBLE . I guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero , you can't afford to hire real voice actors . To me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voice . As a whole , the movie doesn't really go anywhere . To me it seems like it 's more of a " look what we can do " kind of movie instead of a real film . The plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point . The whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to make interesting looking areas . Overall , it may be worth a quick download from the official site , but don't expect anything except pretty graphics .  
  They 're showing this on some off-network . It 's well crap . While it is not as bad as the B-movies they show on the Sci-fi network on Saturdays but still a fairly large pile of crap . The acting is passable . The plot and writing are fairly sub-standard and the pacing is entirely too slow . Every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where they 're wrapping things up before the credits - not the peak of the movie , the denouement . Also , large portions of the cast look way to old for the age range they 're playing . The whole thing is predictable , boring and not worthy of being watched . Save your time . It 's not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free .  
  " Lies " tells about an affair between an 18 year old bucktoothed female student and a scrawny 38 year old married man with the pair of protags spending about half the screen time engaged in naked sex and hokey whipping and the other half meandering through the pathetically naive storyline which seems little more than an excuse for the sex scenes . With very poor production value including obvious sanitary appliances and phony softcore sex to a story which is a messy mix of comedy and drama , " Lies " quickly becomes redundant ad nauseam . With an almost 2 hour run , subtitles , and so little substance , " Lies " is simply not recommendable . ( C- )  
  This film is massively boring and pretentious . There is only one good moment when a sailor shaves Mr Barney 's ( think the purple dinosaur-less pretense ) eyebrow . The music is relentlessly cloying-it is sad that Bjork , someone with so much inner beauty , has been brought down to pretentious falsity in her art . The pomp of the tea service makes a beautiful ritual seem vapid . the mythology and culture are not respected in this film they are lifted . Not just from Japanese culture but from another filmmaker .. ( stay tuned ) In a perfect " art imitates life " moment-the crew of the ship finds a giant piece of sh * t . Which is what the audience found in the theatre . There are some set pieces which are very composed and arty without heart-thenprepare for spoilers-I 'm talking to you MR BARNEY . The Emperor has no clothes ! Mr . Barney you have been outted ! I have seen Jodorowsky 's HOLY MOUNTAIN . And your thin , fake veil of BS has been lifted . You have stolen your images your style and your ENTIRE ART CATALOGUE from this man . Now that HOLY MOUNTAIN has been released FINALLY let 's hope the powers that be at the Art Councils of the world STOP FINANCING YOU ! Poor Jodorowsky-lost in a financial battle with the Beatles Lawyer when he is the Lennon / McCartney of film-making . And BTW while Jodorowsky is the Beatle-YOU ARE THE MONKEES ! A cheap thin soulless rip off only liked by facile kitschy college freshmen . And BTW I am a filmmaker . If you are interested in making a reality film-I will legally fight you in a ring defending Jodorowsky-you , defending outright thievery .  
  I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne Brontë 's novel when I read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy BBC dramas . But I 'm very disappointed , I never thought it would be as bad as that : the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had . First of all , the music ( and songs ) seems totally out of place in a period drama ( sounds as if it 's been written for a contemporary horror film ) and like another commentator , I was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors . I 've seen some scenes filmed that way in " North and South " and it seemed all right there but in The Tenant , it 's definitely overdone and simply annoying . Camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively . Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity . None of the characters were properly introduced at first . The little boy gave a very good performance , he 's very cute and the best feature of the film . SPOILERS Tara Fitzgerald 's characterisation of Helen Graham made her appear cold and harsh , letting no emotion pass through . She doesn't seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way . I just couldn't believe Markham could have fell for her and I 'm not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given . I could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband ! Fancy being married to such a virago .. Besides , he was the only main actor that sounded right to me . Toby Stephens I found just OK , Helen Graham 's brother not very good . Maybe it 's difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty . Besides , what is only hinted at and left to the reader 's imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the TV adaptation : making some scenes both gross and comic , ( like when Huntingdon 's eye starts bleeding ) and others far too sexed up for a period drama ! I mean , don't we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas ?  
  What a terrible film . It starts well , with the title sequence , but that 's about as good as it gets . The movie is something about rats turning into monsters and going on a killing spree . The acting isn't so much poor , but the script is pointless and the film isn't even scary despite the atmospheric music . It really is amazing that some group cobbled together this bag of rubbish and thought it would make a good film . It isn't a good film . It 's trash , and I urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it ! One out of ten .  
  Altered Species starts one Friday night in Los Angeles where Dr . Irwin ( Guy Vieg ) & his laboratory assistant Walter ( Allen Lee Haff ) are burning the midnight oil as they continue to try & perfect a revolutionary new drug called ' Rejenacyn ' . As Walter tips the latest failed attempt down the sink the pipes leak the florescent green liquid into the basement where escaped lab rats begin to drink it .. Five of Walter 's friends , Alicia ( Leah Rown in a very fetching outfit including some cool boots that she gets to stomp on a rat with ) , Gary ( Richard Peterson ) , Burke ( Derek Hofman ) , Frank ( David Bradley ) & Chelsea ( Alexandra Townsend ) decide that he has been working too hard & needs to get out so they plan to pick him up & party the night away . Back at the lab & the cleaner Douglas ( Robert Broughton ) has been attacked & killed by the now homicidal rats in the basement as Walter injects the latest batch of serum in a lab rat which breaks out of it 's cage as it grows at an amazing rate . Walter 's friends turn up but he can't leave while the rat is still missing so everyone helps him look for it . All six become potential rat food .. Also known as Rodentz Altered Species was co-edited & directed by Miles Feldman & has very little to recommend it . The script by producer Serge Rodnunsky is poor & coupled together with the general shoddiness of the production as a whole Altered Species really is lame . For a start the character 's are dumb , annoying & clichéd . Then there 's the unoriginal plot with the mad scientist , the monster he has created , the isolated location , the stranded human cast & the obligatory final showdown between hero & monster . It 's all here somewhere . Altered Species moves along at a fair pace which is just about the best thing I can say about it & thankfully doesn't last that long . It 's basically your average run of the mill killer mutant rat film & not a particularly good one at that either . Director Feldman films like a TV film & the whole thing is throughly bland & forgettable while some of the special effects & attack scenes leave a lot to be desired . For a start the CGI rats are awful , the attack sequences feature hand-held jerky camera movement & really quick edits to try & hide the fact that all the rats are just passively sitting there . At various points in Altered Species the rat cages need to shake because of the rats movement but you can clearly see all the rats just sitting there as someone shakes the cages off screen . The giant rat monster at the end looks pretty poor as it 's just a guy in a dodgy suit . There are no scares , no tension or atmosphere & since when did basements contain bright neon lighting ? There are one or two nice bits of gore here , someone has a nice big messy hole where their face used to be , there 's a severed arm & decapitation , lots of rat bites , someone having their eyeball yanked out & a dead mutilated cat . Technically Altered Species is sub standard throughout . It takes place within the confines of one building , has cheap looking CGI effects & low production values . The acting isn't up to much but it isn't too bad & a special mention to Leah Rowan as Alicia as she 's a bit of a babe & makes Altered Species just that little bit nicer & easier to watch .. Altered Species isn't a particularly good film , in fact it 's a pretty bad one but I suppose you could do worse . Not great but it might be worth a watch if your not too demanding & have nothing else to do .  
  It 's difficult to precisely put into words the sheer awfulness of this film . An entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as ' humor ' or even ' entertainment ' in " Rabbit Test . " So , as a small contribution to this future effort , I 'd like to suggest this word : " Hubiriffic " ( adj . ) A combination of ' hubristic ' and ' terrific ' ; used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film " Rabbit Test . " Joan Rivers and " Hollywood Squares " producer Jay Redack have severely over-reached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82-minute festival of wretchedness . Trying to put together an Airplane ! style comedy with a moldy collection of gags , ( Note to Joan : German doctors haven't been funny since Vaudeville ) disinterred from their graves in the Catskills - that 's is bad enough . But compounding this cinematic crime is River 's directorial style , which can best be described as ' ugly ' , and a cast of once-and-future has-beens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gags . Adrift in this Sargasso Sea of sap is a hapless Billy Crystal in his film debut role as the film 's hapless protagonist Lionel . Watching Crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield ; eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face . I can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like Rabbit Test . Cabbages , mollusks and mildly retarded lizards are all likely candidates . But for self-aware , thinking humans - I 'd enthusiastically recommend pouring bleach in your eyes before I 'd recommend " Rabbit Test . "  
  This movie is truly boring . It was banned in Chinese cinema and i can see why . It 's not because it 's critical of the communist regime but simply because the movie is of such low quality . I would never want to pay money to watch this . I love movies from Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou and i am disappointed such a poor movie could come out of China . It totally seems to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the movie for himself . The shots of a person standing there doing nothing for up to a minute are hilarious and there 's plenty of them . The cinematography and video quality are unbelievably bad . I looked this film up on the Net and it seems like people actually like this film . The only explanation i have for this is that some film buffs think that if a film is not in English it is automatically good . I can't see any reason why people would like this . this is not an art film it 's of waste of celluloid . ( That 's if they actually shot it on film , which they didn't )  
  Hey , If your going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen try making it about Leonard Cohen ! This is filled with only enough Leonard to anger the viewer who will be left wondering why they are listening to all these other singers ( some of them questionable ) talk about themselves . Puleeze .. sounds like them reliving their diary entries in junior high - who cares about you , what about Leonard ? Guess what people , if you " do something " worthy maybe someone will make a documentary about you . I found particularly insulting the parading of U2 's members as if that would add credibility to this movie - NOT . Leonard doesn't need Bono or the Edge talking about his spirituality . What would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to embody some piece of his spirituality through the film . Gee , what a concept ! I will give props to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker for their covers of Cohen tunes - the rest of the performances were a bore and some were unbearable . Cohen fans , don't say I didn't warn you !  
  This film was a disaster from start to finish . Interspersed with performances from " the next generation of beautiful losers " are interviews with Bono and The Edge as well as the performers themselves . This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself , who towers over everyone else in the film with his commanding yet gentle presence , wisdom and humor . The rest are too busy trying to canonize him as St . Leonard or as some Old Testament prophet . Many of the performances are forgettable over-interpretations ( especially Rufus & Martha Wainright 's ) or bland under-achievements . Only Beth Orton and Anthony got within striking distance of Leonard 's own versions by using a little restraint . Annoying little pseudo-avant-garde gestures are sprinkled throughout the film - like out of focus superimpositions of red spheres over many of the concert and interview shots , shaky blurred camera work , use of digital delay on some of Leonard Cohen 's comments ( making it harder to hear what 's being said ) and a spooky , pretentious low drone under a lot of the interview segments ( an attempt at added gravitas ? ) . For the real thing , see the Songs From The Life Of documentary produced by the BBC in 1988 .  
  if you didn't live in the 90 's or didn't listen to rapper EVER ! this movie might be OK for you , but any for any fan or any single person who ever listened to rap this movie was boring and there was no point in the movie where i said thats interesting or i didn't know that . another thing that bugged me was it made it look like anything in his life he did was very easy there was no struggle he made jail look easy , selling drugs , and even rapping it wasn't realistic . i think if the movie where released in about 15 years from now it might have more of an impact maybe ! good rap movies hustle and flow , get rich or die trying not notorious  
  I thought the movie was OK but very disappointed that they didn't capture the true image of his life . I was so anticipating to see his mother being an actual Jamaican , that it 's driving me crazy . Just watching the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not accurate . Which I completely lost interest just a matter of seconds from the beginning of the movie . I 'm very disappointed , that 's like watching a biography story on Mark Anthony and having Arnold play the part . I don't know what the writer was thinking missing a valuable piece of the movie which I 'm sure his mother played a huge role in his life . I will say the movie was OK besides the major Fla !  
  It was all over with the slashers around 88 so it was time for the cheesy rip offs of those older movies . The Brain is well done , the script reminded me of Videodrome but then in a more cheesy way as said before . The acting can go through with it . But it 's the effects that makes you laugh , the so called Brain is really a turkey and the blood is never shown . The opening sequence is what makes this movie worth watching , the hallucinations are really nicely done and reminded me of Nightmare on Elm Street , remember the telephone coming alive .. Some how you keep watching this flick , waiting what is happening next . It 's viewable for all freaks out there cause there isn't any gore in it and as said the blood isn't there neither but there is nudity for the perverts . I have seen worser movies than this one , only wished they had made it bloodier ..  
  Coyote Ugly might have been much more effective if the film-makers had made it an R-rated guilty pleasure / exploitation film ( with plenty of nudity . ) But since the PG-13 rating is what all the studios are wanting these days , we end up with a movie like this : a PG-13 " tease " flick that isn't allowed to go nowhere near as far as the movie should have gone . The script is go generic that it is easy to guess what plot point is going to occur 15 minutes before it actually happens . The acting is adequate , but the characters are so paper-thin that nothing could be done with them . There were also a lot of points where it seemed like I was watching a music-video rather than a movie . The film 's only assets are the amazingly beautiful female leads . We get to see them in some extremely tight and pretty revealing outfits .. but only so much could be shown due to the PG-13 constraints . There 's plenty of cleavage and toned , heaving bodies doing some well-choreographed dance numbers , but there 's no nudity or sex to speak of . Tyra Banks ( she keeps getting even more insanely beautiful with age ) is also in the movie for a very small amount of time . Sexy newcomer Piper Perabo is also very easy on the eyes ( and she has a killer smile ) and shows some genuine acting potential . The only people I could see this movie appealing to is pre-pubescent boys who aren't allowed to watch R-rated movies yet . That audience might get a lot out of it from a titillation aspect , but adult audiences will feel annoyed and cheated . Rating : the movie-1 the women-10  
  This film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized . There are two routes to take in horror films : either you don't really explain what 's going on ( or who the killer is , like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre ) or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained ( Halloween could potentially be an example of this ) . Unfortunately , Creep fails in this area . I see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for Craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation . No character is fully realized , although the circular nature of Kate 's character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story . In the end , this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film-making that drag down the film . This film will go down as another example of a film ( as most are ) that could be so much better even though it would never be great . The only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting : the characters , story , direction , and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift . Creep does serve a purpose as a mindless , silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment , but sadly , that 's about it ..  
  I like end-of-days movies . I like B-movies . I was hoping I would like this movie . I could ignore the poor effects , the often atrocious music , the cringe-inducing lines . I could ignore the unexplained events , and the fact that the movie constantly relies on deus ex machina is excusable , given the subject matter . I could ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the bad guys . None of these things kill the movie . What kills this movie is that it 's just plain and simple boring . Nothing actually happens ; almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the movie creators ' morals on the viewers , at the cost of actually having a coherent story , or any kind of suspense . If you 're looking for an entertaining B-movie , look elsewhere . This movie is just boring .  
  I grew up Baptist and I know the story this movie is trying to tell , although I no longer believe the story . I 'll give the movie kudos for being as good as the average Lifetime Movie of the Week . Mildly interesting , mediocre acting , a bit slow , the script is predictable , the music is sappy , and it is a bit melodramatic . And all the people left behind have got to be the squeakiest clean non-Christians , ever . Not a single curse word from any of them . But I laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the United Nations pronounced " nuclear " as " nu-cu-ler , " just like Bush . Is there some Christian code of honor that mandates that since Bush claims he , too , is called by God , that all Christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does ? LOL ! I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that . After the " nu-cu-ler " incident , the movie began to feel like packaged , manipulative propaganda . I was looking for something bold . Actually , I was looking for something that might make me think , but I didn't find it here . If you 're looking for mindless entertainment , stop here - it 's good for killing a rainy afternoon . But if you 're looking for intelligence , look elsewhere .  
  Okay , now , I know there are millions of Americans who believe in The Rapture : that moment when all people born again in Christ will be raptured up to meet God and all the rest of humanity will be left on earth to perish in plagues and fire and the heartbreak of psoriasis as the Antichrist battles it out with Jesus ( in an uncharacteristically warlike mode ) . And I know the books were best sellers . . . among believers , anyway . And I mean no disrespect to all that . But I have to say , they stuffed this movie into a sack and beat it with the Suck Stick . I 'm sure the books are much better . Really . The plot needs no reprising . If you 've watched this movie , chances are you read the book . I may be one of the only people on earth who actually watched this just for the sheer bad-moving-making experience , and I wasn't disappointed . Especially not by Kirk Cameron , the creepy little " Growing Pains " gremlin , who came of age on that show , found Christ , and decided that the SHOW should reflect his Christian values . Well , Kirk , your career has gone to the dogs , but now you can be happy that you 're spreading the word of God in movies so bad , they never even make it to theatrical release . Well , that 's not strictly true : I guess this was the only movie ever made that went to DVD FIRST , with a voucher for a free viewing of the movie when it was briefly released in theaters ! I still have the voucher ! How many people do you suppose showed up ? I don't know about you , but it never came to my town . Of course , I live in NYC , where we Godless liberals sit around tearing pages out of the bible and use them to roll joints . So there you go . In fact , I 'll bet out of three million people on Manhattan Island , not one would be raptured . Check out the supplementary materials on the DVD , where you 'll learn the creepy behind the scenes details of these movies . . . the CAST and CREW all must be of the same religious mindset . They don't come right out and say this , but listen closely to what the filmmakers say . It 's like a bunch of Pod People got together to make a Pod movie . How creepazoid is that ? Honestly , this stuff just preaches to the converted , doesn't it ? Can you imagine anyone who DOESN'T subscribe to the whole apocalypse thing watching this , slapping his forehead and saying , " HOLY HOOVER DAM ! I better get saved PRONTO ! " Anyhow , I 'm hooked . I gotta see the rest of these Christian fiasco movies , especially the one with Gary Busey , which I think is TRIBULATIONS . At least Busey has an excuse for taking the part .. . . he cracked his head on some pavement when he crashed his motorcycle . Oy . Oh , and one more thing . What 's with all the shots of poor , innocent dogs whimpering , their leashes dragging uselessly along the ground , because their owners have been called to heaven ? What 's up with that ? Are we supposed to feel badly for the dogs , and if we do , what are we to make of God ? Doesn't it IRK people that there 's no room in heaven for man 's best friend ? Foo . This is one more reason I 'm agnostic . Good night and good luck .  
  absolutely trash . i liked Halloween and from then on johnny 's been in a downward spiral . this is about the pits . we get it john . pro-lifers are scary ! you don't have to make a shitty film that bores the hell out of me to ' tell ' me . The pacing is way off here . It feels like john didn't have much to work with here . to his credit it looks like he did not write this junk . There are countless times where the camera just sits and waits for the actors to look dumb or say something dumb . i love the long cut . too bad carpenter doesn't know how to employ it . he needs to bunk up with Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago . Please John , stop making a fool of yourself and boring me to death !  
  There is this girl and she 's running in the woods but she ends up at this woman 's clinic and she wants an abortion . Her daddy is outside in a van and he is all angry about it . The whole episode takes place in and outside of this abortion clinic . I 'm not really pro-choice but I wanted the choice to kill this episode . I was laughing when I saw the baby come out and it went into the corner . The part where they were doing the ultra sound was pretty funny too . I was really feeling sorry for the poor dad in this episode . He just wanted to protect his daughter and I couldn't really blame him for what he did . I don't know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room . I was just laughing too hard and I would suggest watching " Pick me up " instead of this episode . It wasn't the worst episode but it wasn't that great .  
  This film was not nearly as much of a chore as I expected it to be . There are a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore UFO conspiracy paranoia-fest . Most of the acting is mediocre , but fairly typical for 1970s-style stuff replete with pregnant pauses . A photographer and a model witness some strange goings-on in the woods and soon fall victim to these same goings-on . Flying saucers are spotted , more people disappear - but is it the aliens or our own government 's ultra-secret group of cover-up guys ? Soon enough , a reporter and a " UFOlogist " ( apparently modeled on the character of the writer-director ) are drawn into this unraveling fiasco and become the target of the ultra-secret agents who are as menacing as they are improbable and witless . Then the fun really begins . The movie , predictably , makes about as much sense as the average UFO conspiracy theory , but should be commended for taking itself so seriously . The camera work is OK for a low-budget film , the pacing is pretty good , the script is silly and absurd , and there are continuity issues which are fun to look out for . What are the few seconds of brilliance I mentioned ? Honestly , I can't say much you without writing a spoiler . Suffice to say that the end of the film is , at least , worth fast-forwarding to if you can't take the middle .  
  This has to be THE WORST film I have ever seen . I bought the DVD and it didn't work , well the DVD worked fine , its just the film didn't , in fact its so bad that I think non of the actors have worked since ( or before judging from the acting ) . There is no real plot to speak of and no real horror . The production values are rubbish even for a low budget film with some outside scenes being hard to hear due to wind on the microphone . All in all it was so bad a film that a viewer could think it was going to turn into a porno if they didn't know any better ( which have been an improvement ) . There are only two lines in the film that are funny , both of which revolve around the transvestite prostitute . ( Although they hardly merit watching all 76 minutes for ) As for the marketing of the DVD I feel thoroughly cheated . I mean reading the back I expected it to be bad : He chose his weapons . He selected his victims . He picked his nose . He turned into a GIRL ! But I thought it might be funny . Also the case claims it is digitally re mastered , I would love to have seen it beforehand , the print is so grainy you could use it as sand paper . The case also says it is an absolute disgusting movie , IN WHAT WAY ? , disgusting production , acting . This film out stays it welcome in the first five minutes , ( if you are considering buying this I would say buy ` bad taste ' instead it is a much better film and is funny , also it has Peter Jackson the director of the LOTR in it . ) Incidentally if anyone knows anything about any of the actors ( or director Patrick J Mathews ) and what they have done since , please post here as I would love to know , purely to find out if there is a worse movie out there , or if anyone in this film ever bothered to learn to act  
  This movie features Charlie Spradling dancing in a strip club . Beyond that , it features a truly bad script with dull , unrealistic dialogue . That it got as many positive votes suggests some people may be joking .  
  9 , the film I 've been looking forward to for months .. was little more then a disappointment . I was deeply surprised by 9 's lack of story and strange character development . All the awesome action sequences in the world don't make up for a single unsympathetic character . The strange , almost thrown in occult sequences were not only out of place , they were infuriating . The story is about robots and scientists .. why does it suddenly turn into a necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could have been excellently scary story devices ? How , what , when , why .. questions that bode asking only if you care and it becomes less and less likely that you will as you get away from the theater . A film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth .. I would watch this film drawn in crayon if the story was good . But the filmmakers have relied on CGI wizardry and Tim Burtons name to draw in the crowd . Which .. is what drew me in but failed to gain my respect . 9 could have been awesome .. with a few more rewrites and a little more respect from its own creators .  
  Holy @ # % & this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with . I tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of Lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen . I rank this well below anything I have ever watched on film or TV , and thats saying something . I once witnessed a cow crap in a field . I watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half , who knows .. it might have moved or something . Well that was time better spent than watching this tripe . The acting was non-existent , the plot was somewhere other than on this film . I think I saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to Portland in hopes of becoming a Steven King shi77er . Please tell me director is getting medication he so desperately needs . It 's pretty clear he needs heavy medication and I 'd willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal . Bah .. I can't give this review the full punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in typed word alone . Let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this Chilton on the rack , walk to your car , start the engine , then shove both of your fists straight into the fan until it you can't feel your bones vibrate anymore . Be sure to have your wallet in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway . You might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself . By the way , I watched this after a " buddy " of mine sent his girlfriend over so I could see it . HE dint come over , SHE had too . Whats worse is that she had to watch this $ % & @ thing TWICE ! I heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month . I hope it was because of this film .  
  Don't drink the cool-aid . This is an opinion piece disguised as a documentary . And to title it as a " truth " is just plain crap . The debate over global warming is far from over , and will only be over when the eco-zombies start acknowledging the mountain of evidence contrary to their beloved theory . Just Google " Global Warming " and " Hoax " or " Junk Science " and you will find a river of information refuting nearly every link in the chain of logic that Gore sites . The reason it is so important for people to educate themselves is the disastrous economic impact that global warming prevention measures would have . Wake up people . Anyone with a computer , a little time , and some common sense can find many many reasons why this theory is not even close to credible . Don't just read articles that support your present opinions , read everything you can find . There is no in-depth analysis to make , really . There is simply too many alternate possibilities and counter-evidence for the theory to have even the most basic level of scientific credibility . It is so uncredible , in fact , that it may be the single biggest hoax in the course of human existence . It 's time for people to start speaking out against this kind of propaganda , and it 's time for people to admit to themselves and others that you can be a both a conservationist AND recognize the glaring conclusion that global warming hysteria is a big lie .  
  Very unnecessary movie with characters that are acting so unsympathetically that I really didn't care who would fare the best ( or was that the purpose of the film , to portray some smooth talking cold-hearted New York city folks ? ) No romance here , no comedy either . Acting is very flat and a very predictable plot . What annoyed me the most was this constant joking with quotes from classic movies . Man , can't you see that the more you quote , the less significant your own movie becomes ? Try to be original yourself ! A small budget is no excuse at all , first-time director neither . Crappy , crappy , crappy . No wonder it only cost me one buck ..  
  THE BROKEN is part of the After Dark Horrorfest II . Not a slasher or filled with gore . Plenty of broken glass and mirrors in this edgy thriller from France and writer / director Sean Ellis . A successful radiologist Gina McVay ( Lena Headly ) inters a strange world as her life seems to spiral out of control . While attending her father 's ( Richard Jenkins ) birthday party , the guests are stunned when a mirror crashes to the floor for no obvious reason . Things get really strange when she witnesses a woman that is the spitting image of herself driving down a London street in a car identical to her own . Gina sneaks to her doppelganger 's apartment and finds a photo of herself with her father . She drives away and is involved in a head on collision . Then mysteriously her boyfriend is not the same ; to be exact family and friends are not easy for her to trust . Is Gina beside herself ? Is she in a parallel world ? Her nightmares become more horrific .. is she broken ? Kudos if you can figure this one out .. it won't be easy . Editing couldn't be any tighter . Lighting is questionable . Other players : Melvil Poupard , William Armstrong , Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen .  
  I wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the 1984 movie " Bachelor Party " , starring Tom Hanks . Is this movie even an official sequel ? This movie is lacking in every department and you 're obviously better off not watching it . For a comedy this movie simply isn't good or funny enough . It relies mostly on the character 's their stereotypical assessments , rather then the movie actually features some good , original and funny moments . Of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages . You just keep waiting for things to finally start off . There is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if it 's something non-existent . I guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out . It 's basically a typical teenage comedy , with lots of sex jokes and nudity , only without the teenage main characters , which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless . The movie makes some really wrong jokes , that are misplaced for any type of movie . I regret ever watching this . 3/10  
  This film has the look and feel of a Student film project . Yeah , there are some interesting ( albeit gimmicky ) edits and shots , but the end result was juvenile . The director didn't seem to be saying " Look at this film . " It seemed as if he were saying , " Look at ME ! I 'm a DIRECTOR ! " Thumbs down .  
  Gayniggers from Outer Space is pretty much summed up by its name . Running only 27 minutes long , it describes a spaceship of gay blacks that come to Earth to free the men from women . While I see a little significance to the plot , it also is really illogical . Granted , its meant to be a comedy / spoof on society and science fiction . I found myself laughing several times , so it succeeds there . The special effects are horrible . When the spaceship is floating above the Earth , you can see stars zoom by for no apparent reason . The asteroids shown in the beginning look fake , the equipment on the ship is illogical , there are several misspellings in the text , the actors are unconvincing , the characters are messed up ; in general , the whole thing doesn't take itself seriously . If you get past all the aspects that make it a bad movie , its very accessible and easy to see through to the end . Some parts are hilarious . But overall , the only thing that you are left remembering is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts ever . Seeing that its a short film and has some funny aspects , its not the worst thing to see . But its illogical and holds little long-term value . I can't really recommend it ; if you do watch it , do so for the unique concept , not the quality .  
  When I first picked this film up I was intrigued at the basic idea and eager to see what would happen . I 'm a fan of animation and love it when it 's successfully merged with live action footage . However , the animation in this film was about all I enjoyed . Although it must be said that the actors ' performances were excellent . The visual look - including the animation - gave a wonderfully unnerving air to the piece . However this was quality of unease was lost amongst the overblown imagery , both visual and in the script , that you were practically hammered over the head with . Most annoying about this was the relative lack of importance to the plot . It seemed that the plot was shoe horned in at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that detracted massively from the flow of the piece . The voice overs from Felisberto - especially the one at the end - very much felt like a desperate attempt to fill in gaping holes in the plot which had been ignored in favour of side issues such as the whole ant thing ( and even that wasn't properly addressed ) . I 'm afraid the whole piece came across as , at best , a ' reasonable first attempt ' , by a teenager who has spent far too much time reading DH Lawrence . Not what you expect from seasoned film makers at all .  
  I have seen about a thousand horror films . ( my favorite type ) This film is among the worst . For me , an idea drives a movie . So , even a poorly acted , cheaply made movie can be good . Something Weird is definitely cheaply made . However , it has little to say . I still don't understand what the karate scene in the beginning has to do with the film . Something Weird has little to offer . Save yourself the pain !  
  This is by the far worst piece of cr4p I 've ever seen in my life . It barely made sense . It wasn't scary at all ( unless you class scary as loud noises and screaming ? ) Sarah-Michelle Gellar needs to stop with these sh1tty horror films . I think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when i shouted " SHITE " when the credits rolled up . On my list of the worst movies ever made this is how it would go : 1 . The Return 2 . Cabin Fever 3 . Silent Hill The reason i made Silent Hill 3rd is because it showed some frightening scenes , but the rest was absolute cr4p . Same with cabin fever , made no sense , but the return topped that list . Its worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever put together  
  OK i will admit , it started out very pleasing and good , but then it just dropped downhill , i cannot believe Sarah Michelle Gellar could have even finished reading the script after about 5 minutes into the movie , the only reason i actually sat through the whole movie , was i wanted to see the twist at the ned , and to my surprise , well , folks i cannot even tell you if there ven was one , because the end just leaves you confused , and then the credit role , i was like what the hell ? this did not deserve a theater run , i am sorry , but it didn't i mean it was horrible , the only reaso i gave it a 4 is because it had a few jumpy parts .. thats it ! you can watch it , im not telling you not to , hey you might even like it or even love it ! but if you hate it , don't say i didn't warn you !  
  This movie was a complete waste of time . I viewed this movie with a group of cinematic enthusiasts , who have varied taste in movies yet always a keen eye for a work of " genius " ( as one of my fellow commenters on this site had the gall to label this steaming pile ) ; not one of them found a single redeeming quality . We ended the movie with a rousing chorus of expletives I will not reprint here . I can only guess that the positive reviews provided here were written by Sir Anthony Hopkins , himself . Afterall , as one of those reviewers will tell you , he financed the film himself  because no one else in Hollywood or anywhere else in the world , for that matter , would risk a single penny or their good name in association with this film . Don't let the semi-famous actors who appear in the film lure you into its clutches  as Christian Slater admits in the special features " making of " he signed on to the film without reading the script or knowing any details ( a folly I am sure he will never repeat ) . I pity the hapless individual who stumbles into this quagmire of self-indulgence written , directed , produced , and financed by a man who is too famous to admit to himself that not everything he creates is a masterpiece ( and if you don't believe me please google " Anthony Hopkins " AND art ) .  
  PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE TO READ MY ENTIRE REVIEW . I AM NOT KNOCKING THE FILM ITSELF - ONLY THE DVD VERSIONS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE . * I really wanted to give this film even two stars . I mean how could it possibly rank a mere 1 out of 10 ! ? ! Here 's how : An epic film adaptation of Tolstoy 's novel " War and Peace " with historically accurate battle scenes , courtesy of the Red Army , and an extremely faithful , scene-for-scene adaptation of the novel would be difficult but worth sitting through for seven hours - if that 's what you were seeing . The trouble is you can't see that film - anywhere as far as I know . I am attempting to watch the RusCiCo DVD version - widely considered the best version available since it 's letter boxed and restores the scenes that were cut from other DVD releases . But , it is one of the worst film prints I 've ever seen transfered to DVD . The picture is muddy and inconsistent , often strobing . It 's almost tolerable if you crank your brightness , color and picture levels up to maximum .. but the problem doesn't end there . The sound is also way inconsistent , blaringly loud in parts , virtually inaudible in others . And as for languages , it 's a HUGE problem for English speakers - the dubbed option has some good actors , and some really terrible ones whose performance grates , and parts of the film just aren't dubbed at all , slipping back into Russian and even French randomly . The subtitled option isn't much better . The subtitles don't appear below the image , but right over it - obscuring some of the beauty ( or what 's left of it ) in the scenery . Furthermore , the subtitles are often a poor translation ( a shame given that the script took pains to hew so close to Tolstoy 's actual words ) , and the subtitles too seem to just drop out in parts . So , even if you max out the color , brightness and picture settings , and turn the volume way up , and choose subtitled * and * English dubbed , you 're still going to get a film that 's annoying to watch and listen to . Can it 's content overcome that ? It might have been able to , but at seven hours - who can stand it for that long ? Maybe someday , someone will come along and restore this - and maybe then I will see a masterpiece - but for now , I just can't give more than one star to something I 've only been able to stand watching about the first 12 % of .  
  This movie is chilling reminder of Bollywood being just a parasite of Hollywood . Bollywood also tends to feed on past blockbusters for furthering its industry . Vidhu Vinod Chopra made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of " Deewar " and " On the Waterfront " will bring home an Oscar . It turned out to be rookie mistake . Even the idea of the title is inspired from the Elia Kazan classic . In the original , Brando is shown as raising doves as symbolism of peace . Bollywood must move out of Hollywood 's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously .  
  Who was George C . Scott ? George C . Scott was a renowned actor . Practically any movie that he 's been in is the better off for it . Now ol ' George had absolutely NOTHING to do with this movie .. , but he once said something that describes said movie to a T . I don't recall his exact words , but he basically said that Great Writing can Save Bad Acting , But Great Acting CanNOT save Bad Writing . Never has this little observation been truer than in " The All New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy : For Love or Mummy " . The casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect . Bronson Pinchot ( Laurel ) and Gailard Sartain ( Hardy ) not only look the parts , but they do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal ( mannerisms and all ) . This movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents . That said , this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to ( you guessed it ) WRITING . Aside from the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain ( which was very " in character " ) and a brief gag involving a taxi , this movie is an absolute chore to sit through . PROBLEM # 1 : Too much time and effort went into the plot . I don't want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty British lady . What I WANT is to see Stan and Ollie ( or at least , their stand-ins ) . Way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not-very-funny secondary characters that said plot revolved around . However , even if this movie had been all jokes , that would still leave us with .. .. PROBLEM # 2 : Most of the jokes are what I would call " watered-down " slapstick . What do I mean by " watered down " ? In slapstick , a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect ( ala Looney Tunes , 3 Stooges .. , or how about Laurel & Hardy ? ) . In " watered-down " slapstick ( as I define it ) , a character gets mildly hurt or inconvenienced , and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effect . Maybe an illustration would help : In Looney Tunes , Daffy Duck gets shot by Elmer Fudd . His bill falls off and he puts it back on . That is classic slapstick . In this " gem " , Ollie accidentally bumps into some people . They turn around , tell him to be careful , and continue on their merry way . That 's not slapstick . That 's not even funny . That 's just .. boring .. and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes . It 's as though they 're this movie 's bread and butter . The writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they 're supposed to be funny . Granted , the example I just gave is the most extreme case , but I can only cut it so much slack . Long story short : The film just doesn't work because the script fails to capitalize on Pinchot 's and Sartain 's abilities to impersonate Stan and Ollie . Instead , the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes . Watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work with . Not a good movie , but an incredible sleeping aid . I say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal ( just so long as you steer clear of " Atoll K " and " Be Big " ) .  
  Some of the worst , least natural acting performances I 've ever seen . Which is perhaps not surprising given the clunky , lame dialog given to the one note characters . Add to that the cheap production values and you 've got a movie that doesn't look like it even belongs on television . One doesn't expect much from a Lifetime movie , especially one this old , but this is nearly unwatchably bad . Plot-wise , it 's a dreadful , clichéd romance of a type even Harlequin would consider beneath them . It 's possible to guess how the remainder of the movie will go by simply watching the opening couple of scenes . Surprise , the only female character who gets any focus and the mysterious stranger end up falling in love .  
  OK , the story - a simpleminded loony enters a life of bored to death young chick and her kid brother and wreaks havoc in their lives - is mildly interesting one . Anyway , ideas are nothing ( everyone has some .. ) - the execution is everything . This is what bothered me with this flick . And it did bother me immensely . The rhythm ( directing , editing ) was slow , the pace was uneven and the climax expected . We have seen those frigging highways five , six , seven times - why ? Norton character 's troubles were seen as a childish game , not enough deep to understand his problems / soul / blah and to root for or against him . Is he a coward , a manipulator or just a loony ? References to the " Taxi Driver " were ridiculous and unnecessary and for certain not in favor for this flick ( or to E.N. for that matter ) . And IMHO , it is cowardly executed at the end . Cheap emotional tricks for teenage lovers somewhere in Mid America . This guy should have killed the kid , blamed the father , create a real havoc . Or the kid should have killed the father at the end etc . , but no , we have gotten cheesy ending where kids miss the loony , the father is puzzled over his own life and relationship with them and the loony , of course , dies . The happy dysfunctional family stays unharmed , safe and happily bored again so we could enjoy our pop-corns , undisturbed . And that scene where the loony enters the movie , oh my God , I would have to think long and hard to find something stupider than that ! You do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew . Creators of that movie probably thought that was a good idea but it was more than annoying . Again , if you 're a 16 years old girl somewhere in Kansas nowhere or whatever-where and dream about having sex with a crazy man twice your age , OK , then you might enjoy this movie and its " message " .  
  MY EYES ! IN THE NAME OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS HOLY MAKE ME UNSEE THIS MOVIE ! what drugs are you people on ! this could very well be the worst movie ever ! i felt like i was on a bad acid trip the whole time , i need to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster . From start to finish glow ropes is an unholy masterpiece of satanic cinema . when i thought to watch this movie with my Jewish best friend and his family we thought " oh hey , this may be funny ! it will probably be bad but still a little funny " how wrong we were , we were not prepared for how awful this movie could be . All of my friends lined up for lobotomies as soon as the film was over , and during the course of the movie , one of my friends attempted to hang himself with his belt while another tried to slit his wrists with a wooden spoon . I wish I had watched the video from The Ring instead , that way the pain and suffering would be over in only seven short days . For all who wish to see this movie , YOU ARE NOT PREPARED ! you may think you are some sort of " tough guy " by renting this but this movie will break you , push you to the ground and urinate on you .  
  Not one of Keaton 's best efforts , this was perhaps a veiled attempt to revenge himself on the family he married into - the Talmadges . A Polish / English language barrier and a series of coincidences leads Buster into a marriage with a large Irish woman , who ( along with her father and brothers ) treat him shabbily until they think he may be an heir to a fortune . Mistaken identities abound here - gags are set up and but for the main fail to pay off . This Metro short does have at least two real laughs - Buster 's cleverly turning around his lack of dinner by using the calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adopted family to literally bring the meat to his plate . The other is a family photo , with the entire group slowly collapsing to the floor as the tripod of the camera loses its stability . The yeast beer overflow could have been the catalyst for a massive series of gags built upon gags , but stops short ( for all the buildup ) of development . Kino 's print is crisp and clear and the score is one for player piano , drums and sound effects . Not one of Buster 's best efforts , but worth a few laughs .  
  I finally caught up to " Starlight " last night on television and all I can say is . . . wow ! It 's hard to know where to begin - the incredibly hokey special effects ( check out the laser beams shooting out of Willie 's eyes ! ) , the atrocious acting , the ponderous dialogue , the mismatched use of stock footage , or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production . This truly is a one of a kind experience , and we should all be thankful for that . I nominate Jonathon Kay as the true heir to Ed Wood !  
  Once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent . Reuniting with some former co-stars to clean up the town . Low key , often to the point of blandness , " action " comedy mostly just doesn't work . Part of the problem is the casting Chris Klien as a former action hero . he 's not bad , but he 's really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy . As I said he 's not bad , he 's just just miscast for what his back story is . The real problem here is the combination of the script , which really isn't funny and seems artificial at times , and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness . There is no life in the way things are set up . Its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list . It makes for an un-engaging film . And yet the film occasionally springs to life , such as the in the final show down that ends the film . That sequence works , but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its power . I can't really recommend the film . Its worth a shot if you 're a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms , but otherwise this is just a disappointment .  
  I 've written at least a half dozen scathing reviews of this abysmal little flick and none get published , so I must opine that someone at imdb . com really likes this awful movie . The idea that a bunch of oilmen can resurrect a military tank that has set in the desert for over a decade , and make a fighting machine of it again is ludicrous . So is the acting and direction . Pass on it .  
  Well , it was funny in spots . This film is a 4 or maybe a 3 . Its a film that sits on the video shelf and gathers dust . Rent this one after you seen everything else . Beats boredom , but not by that much . My wife like like this film better then I do , maybe its not that bad .  
  " Paula , I may be a bitch , but I 'll never be a butch ! " A hilarious line in an otherwise rather tiresome skin flick which features a pretty honey in Stacey Walker , but that 's about all . This gal 's a real tease who lures her boyfriends , co-workers and even her lesbian roommate Paula into her bedroom , but then turns into a whack job who cries " rape " and calls for the police ! The schizophrenic personality of this certified c * t is interesting for maybe a little while , but this story ultimately turns into a real repetitive one-note affair . At least the ending is worth the wait , for those who will still care by that time .  
  This " screwy comedy " seems very forced . Indeed , the actors TRY very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script . And , as a result it doesn't really go anywhere . The idea of a woman finding out she was pregnant after getting a quickie divorce just isn't all that funny . And then , when Cooper sneaks off with the baby because he doesn't want it put up for adoption just seems terribly unfunny and it 's really pushing hard to turn this into a comedy . It 's really a shame , too , as the actors were more capable than the script and I found myself just bored by the whole mess . Considering that Cooper made so many GOOD comedies , I recommend you see them instead .  
  Avoid this crap at all costs . Bad script , bad directing , bad acting , bad editing , bad sound , and bad music . Get the idea ? This movie tries to be western flavored , it 's not . It tries to be hard core violent , it 's not . It tries to present a fresh look at an old genre , it doesn't . The actors try there best , and my heart goes out to them . But with such inane material to work with it 's hard to make something shine . To me this has all of the looks of a " fresh outta film school gonna set the world on fire " first attempt . Freshmen film makers often bite off more that they , or their budget , can chew . The best thing they can do is to take a few steps back , reassess what is possible , and work within their limited budget the next time out .  
  In this movie , the old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman , again . He meets her in his restaurant . The younger woman , Tabu , flirts with him . He does not know what to do and asks her out . Her reaction on his invitation is rather weird . Is was supposed to be funny . And that annoys me about this whole movie . It wasn't that funny . The jokes and script was terrible ! The only jokes I liked was about the teeth of a waiter , but after a several times , even that began to bore . Amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy . This was a weird relationship ! A little girl with the mind of an old woman ! It was frightening ! I know someone can be attached to a kid , but this man has adult conversations with this child . It did not make any sense . Tabu 's father is Paresh Rawal . He has to give Amitabh a hard time , but we all know Paresh , he can't do that . So even the conversation at the end , when they sit all around the table , even that was supposed to be funny . I only like movies who really are funny . I suppose I will never watch this movie again .  
  R Balki tries to tell you a story that had been earlier told by Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd in a sensuous way . This time it is mixed with mature humors . Amitabh Bachchan is a Chef and owns an Indian Cuisine in London . He is very dominating and arrogant and respects his job just like any other job . According to him , Cooking is an art . Still cannot make Hyderabadi Biryani properly . Enter Tabu who sends her the proper Hyderabadi Biryani made by her and they soon starts meeting up and finally falls in love with each other Amitabh is 65 and Tabu is 35 . No probs ! But one Hitch ! Tabu 's father Paresh Rawal ! The couples decide to meet the father for the approval of their marriage . But Amitabh realizes that Tabu 's father is much younger to him . And the complications begin Performance wise all three actors are brilliant . The script of the film is very tight and interesting . The dialogues of the film are catchy . But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled . The comedy is sometimes not properly understood . The film also tries to go lengthy at some parts . Musically nothing much to sing about except the Title Track . The camera-work is good . Director R Balki could have given much better from this script . But in the second half he himself looks confused . The " Satyagrah " scene of the father looked irritating . But the lines spoken by Amitabh Bachchan during that scene are clap worthy . On the whole , Cheeni Kum needed to have more sugar !  
  Thomas Archer ( Ron Eldard ) has his child killed and his wife viciously attacked in a home invasion . Dr . Heller ( Christopher Plummer ) tries to help him through the post traumatic stress . Then Archer finds himself confronted with a man ( Til Schweiger ) bound and gagged to a chair . He is told this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes to him . And there 's a large assortment of instruments there to help him .. Film is interesting at first ( and shows real restraint in terms of blood and gore ) but gets stupider by the minute and has some highly unlikely plot twists and turns . It all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that I was shocked anyone would actually think of using it anymore . How such talented actors like Eldard , Schweiger and Plummer got involved in crap like this is beyond me . This gets three stars for the acting but the stupid plot and truly unbelievable twists make this a chore to sit through .  
  Rating : 4 out of 10 As this mini-series approached , and we were well aware of it for the last six months as Sci-Fi Channel continued to pepper their shows with BG ads , I confess that I felt a growing unease as I learned more . As with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time , different people go to it to see different things . In this regard , when people think of Battlestar Galactica , they remember different things . For some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor . For others , it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time . Many forget the state of special effects during the late 70s , especially those on television . For some the memories resolve around the story arc . Others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they faced . Frankly , I come from the latter group . The core of Battlestar Galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire . Yes , evil . The Cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it . While base stars were swirling around , men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources , and somehow they managed to survive until the next show . They didn't survive because they had better technology , or more fire power . They survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next show . The show had its flaws , and at times was sappy , but they were people you could care about . The writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this . In some ways he took the least significant part of the original show , the character 's names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction . Since that was their goal , they can be judged on how well they accomplished it : failure . It was far from a reinvention . In fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time . It borrows liberally from ST : TNG , ST : DS9 , Babylon 5 , and even Battlefield Earth . I find that unfortunate . Ronald D . Moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade , and has made contribution to some of the most popular television Science Fiction that you could hope to see . One of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the Enterprise D & E . That was the inviolable rule of Roddenberry 's ST : TNG . Like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority , Ron Moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master : Gene Roddenberry . Here , instead of writing the best story possible , he has created a dysfuntional cast as I have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could . Besides being dysfunctional , some of it was not the least bit believable . Anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days " in hack , " they could have gotten execution , and they never would have gotten out the next day . It wouldn't have happened , period , especially in time of war . The thing that I remembered most of Ron Moore 's earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of Capt . James Kirk . He killed Capt . Kirk , and , alas for me , he has killed Battlestar Galactica .  
  This was the worst MTV Movie Awards EVER ! I barely laughed , none of the presenters were funny , the hosts really sucked , and the parodies weren't so great either . Why can't we go back to the good olden days when the show was a riot ?  
  Now , it would be some sort of cliché if i began with the bit about the title , so i 'll wait on that . First , this movie made me wonder why kids do stupid things like wander around in labs and break bottles . Then i realized it , this is a movie with a message , that message is beat kids and things like this won't happen . Things like what you ask ? Things like a giant insectish monster growing up and causing a bit of mayhem before dying in the typical " kill the monster indirectly " fashion . Now , as promised .. Blue Monkey .. has nothing Blue in it nor any Simian of any kind . Now it snot like i was cheated or anything . The picture on the cover had a giant bug / crab / idiot / thing on the front chasing some screaming nurses . That kinda happened but i wanted apes ! having just enjoyed MOST EXTREME PRIMATE a few nights before ( half drunk on Cask and Creame 's brandy mind you ) i was in the mood for more monkey hijacks 80 's style . Not so much . If you like snow boarding apes or blue things this movie is not for you . If you like bugs and good reasons to hit kids , rent this .  
  What the hell is this ? Its one of the dumbest movies I 've seen . I don't understand why people on this site love it so much . Its senseless & nudity for no reason . Its worst then Resident Evil . I strongly don't recomend it unless you want to watch chessy , bad acting crap . Watch real horor movies such as Stephen King 's It , The Shining , Jurassic Park ( kinda horor ) , JAWS , etc . Leave this crap for a rental when there is nothing else to rent . It is bad as Crudy vs Gayson . Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is better then this crap . Oh wow flesh eating zombies . How many damn zobie movies do we need . SKip this one . * outta *  
  On the face of it , Ruiz has set out to make a psychological thriller . Although it 's not as satisfying as a classic piece in that genre , there are compensations . The tensions generated between Huppert and Balibar as women calmly but calculatingly at war over a boy they both claim are compelling ; however , in a true European art-house style , Ruiz doesn't give us release of this tension as the women alternately also try to behave compassionately towards each other . The only raised voice is that of Huppert 's waking from a nightmare ( an uncontested irrational event in the film ) . In fact , if we follow the title , the film is as little about its thriller skeleton as Jane Campion 's In The Cut . Instead it is an intergender psychological study focusing on men . The boy , Camille ( Nils Hugon ) , decides on a practical joke , playing his mother off against an emotionally vulnerable other woman . Both women seem to pander to him rather than scold and this compounds the problem . In the background is an intemperate psychologist ( Charles Berling ) , swift to confront the women in his life - his sister Huppert , the nanny or his pa - and so acting as a symbolic adult counterbalance to the , calm and ( we learn ) manipulative Camille . It is particularly interesting that , like the father in Henry James ' The Turn of The Screw , Denis Podalydes ' law-enforcer Father is absent for the duration of the film . Ruiz fashions an Oedipal moment out of Huppert 's reaction to his return at the film 's close . Read either as a thriller or as a psychiatric essay , this film is ultimately rather disappointing . I 'm officially rather fed up with Mme Huppert 's screen method , which is too buried and so I 'll be looking to see her on stage before I come back to her ( European - enjoyed Heaven 's Gate ) films again . The support is good . Ruiz does the cast no favours though . Quite apart from some poor lighting and some wilfully odd shots , its as if his direction has left characterisation quite out of reach - I 'm thinking particularly of Edith Scob 's Shamanic neighbour to Isabelle , who acts knowing but communicates bafflement . The set pieces do not link up to a forward driving plot - the tension I have already referred to is not only weakly dissipated but wasted in its directional potential . Want to see a good contemporary French thriller ? Go and see L'Appartement instead . 4/10  
  I 'm not ruining anything when I inform you that you get to see a woman have sex with a goat in this movie . If that is your thing , then your movie has arrived . A woman and her husband go to see her estranged sister in the family mansion in the woods . Her sister is a creepy lady to say the least , and she seems to have interests that go beyond family love . On the side a group of unsavory characters show up and begin enacting all kinds of pagan rituals . The plotting is pretty weak and the characters are pretty dumb . The woman sticks around even after her husband starts turning into a jerk and hanging out with the pagans , even continues the have sex with him . On the exploitative side of things , there is much bared flesh and a couple of kinky couplings , but nothing that hasn't been better somewhere else . Oh , and the aforementioned goat-sex scene . Most viewers won't make it to the end . Exploitation fans will ride it out , but will be left wanting more . 4/10  
  This movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong . i really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add which was funny as hell but the movie wasn't half as good . The weird part is that the jokes are actually funny , the spoofs of the smoking ban , Jo Bole .. etc . are genuinely good jokes but i don't know whom to blame this movie flop on . The prime candidates may be : - 1 ) The hammers ( actors ) and hammeresses ( actresses ) and not even the funny kind 2 ) The director 3 ) The guy who cast the actors and / or the director Anyway if you are really really bored and i mean really see this movie , or else get a copy of each and every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your butt of because those will be far funnier than the film . p . s the only saving grace of this film is mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai  
  OK , not possibly , honestly the worst movie i 've ever seen . this made absolutely no sense , there was no plot , no characterization , no acting , just nothing . here 's what i thought when i first saw it may 28th , 2003 * caution , this is a spoiler alert . it 's also alot of me complaining about how bad the movie is : ok so the movie begins and the characters are introduced , but there is no character explanation . as far as i knew the main character was new to this school , but apparently not . also it appeared that he lived by himself .. then that he was a foster kid .. then that his mother was a raging alcoholic who lived with him still . also all his friends apparently had no parents and lived by themselves . now we come to a main plot point , this insane guy has broken out of the insane asylum and is running rampant . now our main character is obsessed with this guy and focus ' intently on him for the contingency of the movie . i think i must have missed a main plot element here , there was no REASON for the main character to get hooked . even if that 's the point , having no reason , why do all his friends , who are skeptical like 5 minutes before , suddenly follow him and do what he wants . so the movie continues on , and it gets all right . they 're running havoc on the school , blah blah blah . but wait a minute .. suddenly everyone knows that the main character is running the ' show ' here . wait a second , didn't the insane guy specifically tell the main character NOT to do that ? it was supposed to be anynomous . ah another important plot element has been skipped over .. the insane guy was supposed to not be insane .. everyone said he wasn't insane . but as the story goes on , he is VERY CLEARLY OUT OF HIS MIND . but i thought the news people said he wasn't .. hm .. now the movie comes to a close . THAT WAS THE CLOSE ? WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ? not only did the ending not answer any questions about the main character , it didn't answer any questions about the insane guy . are these people in the same situation ? if yes , then there are some very basic story lines that do not tend to this . if no then what is the point in saying " that 's you in two weeks . " ? * end of the thing .. * that 's what i thought then . that is pretty much what i still think now . it 's 6 months down the line , and if i can get it for free , i might give it another chance , but i doubt it . i highly doubt it .  
  My husband rented this from a video store thinking it was suspense . ( He never reads the synopsis ) . Well , it would be funny if the thing was watchable . It simply isn't . The same thing over and over , no intrigue , and WHERE did they find the leading man ? . The leading man , Michael Des Barres , is not even feasibly good-looking , especially for this role he is given . Also , sexual harassment at work is something , if you want to see , rent Michael Crichton 's " Disclosure " . At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early 90 's . Alexandra Paul , who is usually watchable , plays an embarrassing scene here . There are also lighting effects cheaper than your at home web cam . Don't even waste time renting this . 0/10 .  
  This movie never made it to theaters in our area , so when it became available on DVD I was one of the first to rent it . For once , I should listened to the critics and passed on this one . Despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing . I can see now why it went straight to video . I had thought that with Bloom , Ledger , and Rush it could have some value . All have done wonderful work in the past . The movie was slow moving and never pulled me in . I failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end . I do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for ' eye candy ' purposes . It won't satisfy even that .  
  Why every horror director wants to imitate " The Exorcist " is a complete riddle to me , as William Friedkin 's " classic " is a very overrated film and , in my opinion , not all that tense or shocking . And yet here 's another clean rip-off , a Spanish one this time , that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family . Paul Naschy ( who I must admit looks quite hot here ) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila 's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend . At first the priest doesn't believe it but when John 's body is discovered with its neck twisted , Leila 's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable .. " Exorcism " is not only very unoriginal , it 's also an insufferably boring film ! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore , and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that 'll nearly put you to sleep ! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments , albeit very stupid , and there 's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze . The absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since Paul Naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money . This is just an awful film , end of story . Other European " The Excorcist " rip-offs are " The Antichrist " and " Beyond the Door " and they suck as well !  
  There is a scene near the beginning after a shootout where horses are running . If something red catches your eye it is because a white van is parked behind a bush by the trail . I thought I had seen bad but this is it . A white van in a western . Did they not catch this ? Oh well , and I paid top dollar at the rental . It will make you want to grab your buddies and have them all put in 10 grand and make a better movie . The talking was so so slow , the acting was mostly OK but couldn't be taken seriously due to the poor nature of the filming . There is a door at the sheriffs that looks like a door today with the particular trimming . I say watch this movie , and move Cabin boy into # 2 on the worst of all time .  
  .. CAUSE IT 'S CRAP ! The kind of movie that makes you want to go and smack the movie maker and say " WHY ? " . Horrible camera work .. count the times the camera tries to remain steady on one person and can't . The dialog is ridiculous . The acting is comical . It looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible . I 'd bet $ 10 they used home video cameras to make this . Either that , or most of the cameramen were drunk . Truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie . If you ever want to host a " Worst Movie Party " , bring this one . Want more entertainment .. stare at a wall .  
  I thoroughly enjoyed Bilal 's graphic novel when it came out , and was amazed when I saw the trailer for this film , and even more so when I found that Bilal had directed it himself . The film , however , was a major letdown . The visuals are nowhere near the rich and gritty texture of the original artworks , and the story is poorly told . Bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel , and he doesn't do a very good job at it , either . The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the friendship-hate relationship between Nikopol and Horus . They were both out of their right time and place , forced together by circumstance . Most of all , they were funny and likable . Not so here . Nikopol has no discernible personality whatsoever , and Horus is a pompous twit who just wants to get laid . Even though the film is French , Horus doesn't have to be ! We have all seen films we enjoyed , but wouldn't recommend to everyone , for some reason or other . I wouldn't recommend Immortel to anyone , except maybe as a warning not to overreach your talent and resources . Bilal 's a master storyteller , but obviously not a master of every visual medium .  
  I wasn't particularly impressed by this movie that has lackluster music and only lasts 40 minutes . Thank God , because I was falling asleep . I makes excellent use of time lapse photography to display the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow , people , water , clouds , etc . Unfortunately , that 's all it is . My preference is for its predecessor , the excellent Koyaanisqatsi made in 1983 at 87 minutes and to prove that a sequel can be better than the original , Powaqqatsi made in 1988 running 90 minutes . Try them both .  
  This British-Spanish co-production is one of the countless films shot in Spain in the wake of the unexpected phenomenal success enjoyed by the Italian " Spaghetti " Westerns and , as is typical of such genre efforts , features an eclectic assortment of established and emerging international stars : Robert Shaw , Telly Savalas , Stella Stevens , Martin Landau , Fernando Rey , Michael Craig , Al Lettieri , Dudley Sutton , Antonio Mayans , etc . Ironically , however , this incoherent mess of a movie serves as a shining example as to why that most American of film genres became a dying breed in the 1970s and is nowadays practically ( or is that officially ? ) extinct . I really wanted to like this film , not only because the Western is one of my favorite types of movies but also because it had all the qualities , including an intriguing premise , to be a good one - not to mention the fact that my father had purchased a paperback edition of A TOWN CALLED BASTARD 's novelization following its original release ! As it is , the film 's sole virtue ( if , indeed , it can even be called that ) is its sheer eccentricity : for instance , Stevens , playing a widow out for revenge on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband , sleeps inside a coffin ( ! ) driven around in a carriage by her dumb manservant ( ? ) Sutton ; Savalas , as a blood-thirsty renegade , who at first appears to be the film 's main villain , is unceremoniously dispatched by his own henchman Lettieri very early on in the picture ; the villain of the piece , then , turns out to be Landau who , in the film 's very first scene , is seen pillaging side-by-side our legendary hero-turned-priest Shaw ! ; Fernando Rey , playing a blind peasant , is the only one who can identify rebel Shaw who , in the end turns out to have been merely a front for .. well , nevermind ! As you can see , the plot is very confusing and it gets stranger from there ! The production team responsible for this film were also behind other Western fare around the same period of time , like CUSTER OF THE WEST ( 1967 ) , BAD MAN 'S RIVER ( 1971 ) , CAPTAIN APACHE ( 1971 ) and PANCHO VILLA ( 1972 ) .  
  I chuckled a few times during this movie . I laughed out loud during the notarizing of the margarine company handover ( pun intended ) . There are three segments in this movie . The first one is supposed to be a spoof of " woman ' grows up ' and launches career " movies . The Tampax® box was the funniest thing in this segment . Most of the cast members aren't listed here on IMDb . They are the lucky ones . Few other people will be able to connect this thing to the ruin of their acting careers . The second segment is a spoof of " sharkish woman sleeps her way to the top and seizes control of huge industry " movies . Robert Culp has several funny moments , all physical humor , including the aforementioned handover . After his character dies the segment sinks lower and lower as Dominique Corsaire rises higher and higher . By the time she becomes First Lady I wanted to rip the cable out of the TV and watch " snow . " I switched to Pakistani music videos instead . I don't understand Urdu , or whatever language the videos were in . It was still better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull " story . " Then came " Municipalians " with the * big * stars , half of them on screen for less than a minute : Elisha Cook , Jr . , Christopher Lloyd , Rhea Perlman , Henny Youngman , Julie Kavner , Richard Widmark and .. * Robby Benson . * It 's supposed to be a spoof of " young cop teams with hardened , substance abusing older cop who needs retirement * badly * " movies . The horizontal flash bar on the police car is very impressive . It was interesting seeing old RTD buses , and a Shell gas station sign , and an American Savings sign - none of them are around anymore . Nagurski 's " Never stop anywhere you might have to get out the car " made me smile momentarily . Then they discuss how boring the young cop is . A lot . Back and forth about how boring he is . That was as boring as this description of how boring it is . Nagurski 's Law Number Four , " Never go into a music store that 's been cut into with an acetylene torch , " made me think that the music store is a real business at the actual location the dispatcher gave . Thinking about that was more interesting than the set-up for the gag which followed . Young Falcone ( Benson ) gets shot . A lot . He becomes a hardened cop like Nagurski . The segment keeps going . On and on . And on . It won't stop . It rolls relentlessly onward no matter how many times you wish he 'd just * die * already so this thing will end . It doesn't . It goes on and on and on .. Then a " Buffy the Vampire Slayer " episode which I 've seen four times already comes on . Thank God ! This abysmal movie ended while I went to get the mail .  
  I 've been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line wasn't good at all . The play of the actors weren't any better . Of course Shahrukh Khan was there yet he wasn't enough to make this movie " credible " and interesting . I 've read that this movie was based on the novel of Flaubert " Madame Bovary " yet for me I didn't see it matching with the Indian mentality . In general we buy movie to dream and have a good time , not to waste our time and change our mood into worse . I just can't understand how it could get such a " high " vote with an average of 6.8/10 . So it 's the kind of movie you should run away & ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it ! You will just waste your time unless if you like " dark movie " with " strange and non sense story " .  
  Twenty years ago , the five years old boy Michael Hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later . On the present days , Michael ( Gordon Currie ) invites his girlfriend Peg ( Stacy Grant ) and his best friends Chris ( Myc Agnew ) , Jennifer ( Emmanuelle Vaugier ) , Lisa Ann ( Kelly Benson ) , Ned ( Brendon Beiser ) , Mitch Maldive ( Phillip Rhys ) and Trish ( Rachel Hayward ) to spend the Halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm . He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear , and together with his Indian friend Crow ( Byron Chief Moon ) , they would perform an ancient Indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy Morty ( Jon Fedele ) that would eliminate their fears forever . The greatest fear of Michael is to become a serial killer like his father , but something goes wrong and Morty turns into his father , killing his friends . " The Fear : Resurrection " is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows , but in a messy screenplay full of clichés . There are some exaggerated performances , like for example Ms . Betsy Palmer ; others very weak , but in general the acting is good . Unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live ; further , in spite of being surrounded by close friends , the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies . The low-pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation . In the very end , Michael shows a charm that his father was interested that I have not noticed along the story . I do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the DVD released in Brazil with 87 minutes running time . The special effects are very reasonable for a B-movie . My vote is four . Title ( Brazil ) : " Fear 2 : Uma Noite de Halloween " ( " Fear 2 : One Night of Halloween " )  
  Well let me say that I have always been a Steven seagal fan and his movies are usually great but this just don't measure up to the rest . This in my opinion is very stupid I did not like it all . The biggest reason I don't like it is because it is very flawed and to me does not make much sense . The acting is very bad even Steven seagal does not do good acting , The rest of the actors I can see because they just do direct to video movies . It does not follow a straight storyline everything happens at once so that why it doesn't make much sense . Ther is barely any action in it at all and in order to make an action movie good you usually need action in it . The special effects are very bad and you can tell are fake . So all in all this has to seagals worst movie of all so if you want to see a Steven seagal movie don't rent this one just pretend it does not exist . So just avoid this movie . Overall score : * out of * * out of *  
  drss1942 really took the words right out of my mouth . I loved Segal 's early films and feel like the only one who is still faithful to him . I just saw this movie ( ok , fell asleep about 90 % through , so I didn't see the end ) . When I woke up and saw I was at the DVD menu , I was thankful I didn't subject myself to any more of that movie and didn't dare find out what happened at the end . There was something strange about the voice of Segal and others . Kinda reminded me of the original Mad Max where the voice were dubbed , but in the same language ( Australlian is English , right ? : ) Anyway , if I had 10 thumbs , they 'd all point down right now for this Segal injustice .  
  What do you call a horror story without horror and story ? This is the most irritating thing about the film : I get the feeling the writers never really decided what 's actually going on in the film ! It 's a different thing to know it , give hints for the audience and not completely reveal it , but here , you get the feeling the screenwriters don't know it , characters in the film do not know it and audience sees that no one knows ! ( Remember " Cube " ? Even that film knew more about itself . ) I 've consumed a lot of 80 's horror / gore films and this movie certainly has its roots deep in those films . But a lot of important things are missing . We really know nothing about the characters . They keep repeating empty lines over and over again . The story isn't really developing - it never goes anywhere . B-acting is OK in this type of horror films , but there 's not much to act in the script . We don't care about the characters . There 's nothing to remember about them . There 's not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex . And most importantly - no thrills , no chills . You only get some commonly used elements of the horror film genre . They show the Lordi monsters one by one but their characters don't really contribute anything for the story . I honestly believe that this amount of story , character development and atmosphere could be achieved with minimal amount of crew and equipment . Oh yeah , film makers used to do that - and more - some 20 years ago ! I felt the shared embarrassment of the audience as the film ended . Too bad really .  
  When I saw previews of this movie I thought that it may be dumb , but it will at least be funny . Well I was wrong . Even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their life , the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible . The first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny . But by the end , I could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next . Throughout the movie I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre , which is still more than I can say for the movie itself .  
  One would think ( as I did ) , that with Steve Martin , Goldie Hawn , and John Cleese , a movie should be , at the very least , decent . These stars ( especially Martin and Cleese ) have produced some of the funniest works of comedy of all time . Well , apparently I was grossly mistaken-this is single-handedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen . It boggles my mind how one joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny . It pained me to watch these talented actors execute one of the most positively lame scripts I have had the misfortune to come across . Based solely on the big names , I remained hopeful for a long time through the duration of the film , but it consistently failed to provide any entertainment whatsoever . Normally , both with movies and in life , I try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations . But with this film , it 's hard not to let loose . I can count on one hand , perhaps even two or three fingers , major Hollywood productions that left me more bitter than this . This is easily one of the worst comedies ever made . I tried to enjoy this-I really did . But The Out-of-Towners ultimately fails miserably . If you really want time-efficient entertainment , just take your money and watch it swirl as you flush it down the toilet . Just please don't watch this movie .  
  what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless . movie . A remake that did not need to be retold . Everyone coming out of the theater had the same comments . Worst movie I ever saw . Save your time and money ! Nicgolas Cage was biking down hills , swimming in murky water and rolling down hills while being attacked by bees but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last scene . Although a good cast with Ellen Bernstein and Cage the acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself . It is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies . Don't they get a copy of the script first . If you still have any interest at all in seeing the movie at the very least wait for it to come out on DVD .  
  Gorgeous bodies , gorgeous colors and camera work , pretentious dialog , banal plot . The name of the prima donna , Camilla , and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently , are enough to remind us of the plot similarities from Dumas ' novel La Dame aux Camelias , the movie Camille starring Garbo and ( I think ) Robert Taylor , and last but not least Verdi 's opera La Traviata . Beautiful , not-too-virtuous young ladies , social outcasts for one reason or another , loved , split up , reunited just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene .. One forgives banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialog in opera , but why waste Hayak , Don Sutherland , a beautiful rendition of LA in the 30s , a deus ex machina earthquake that conveniently kills the other woman , and all that beauty on this mediocre turkey where there isn't even any beautiful singing ?  
  Most definitely the worst Columbo ever dreamt up . No murder and the abandonment of the tried and tested formula makes this a real drag . Falk looks bored throughout and so will you be if you waste anytime watching this .  
  An uninspired and undistinguished " new " Columbo which sees the man in the mac attend his nephew 's wedding , only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night . Columbo investigates .. And that it is about it : indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script , given that it is written by Robert Van Scoyk , who penned the highly enjoyable Columbo story " Murder Under Glass " in the detective 's heyday ; there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to Columbo by the script-writer is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding , which include everybody who was there ! Devoid of every Columbo trait possible , I thought I was watching an episode of Hill Street Blues . An insult to the history of the series , with appropriately soap-opera style acting . Very avoidable stuff .  
  Dumb is as dumb does , in this thoroughly uninteresting , supposed black comedy . Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein trying to maintain a low profile , eventually morphs into an uninspired version of " The Three Amigos " , only without any laughs . In order for black comedy to work , it must be outrageous , which " Play Dead " is not . In order for black comedy to work , it cannot be mean spirited , which " Play Dead " is . What " Play Dead " really is , is a town full of nut jobs . Fred Dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton 's character from " A Simple Plan " , while Jake Busey does a pretty fair imitation of , well , Jake Busey . - MERK  
  The script for this Columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980 's soap opera . Deeply character-driven films are great , but only if the characters are compelling . And in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel . The villain 's dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist . The great Lt . Columbo himself is no where near his famous , lovable , self-effacing , crumpled self ; and the bride / kidnap victim is a whimpering , one-dimensional damsel-in-distress ( she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor - come on ! I could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the you-know-what in 2 seconds ) . In any sense of reality , this character would have at least TRIED to struggle or fight back at least a little . And speaking of reality .. the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police . The POLICE ? Give me a break . Everyone knows the FBI takes over EVERY kidnapping case . This was NO Columbo , just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar Lt . Columbo written in and stretched to 2 hours .

Based on the video game director Uwe Boll attempts to recreate the game into an action-packed nail biter sadly he doesn't succeed . Instead he makes one of the worst movies ever MADE ! Even though he gets minor celebrity such as Christian Slater , Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff his movie lacks the necessary fundamentals that a movie needs to be good such as a story line , and some basic relativity of what 's going on in the dark and the light . The movie bounces all around and Uwe Boll has no creative control . And not to mention the bad CGI used on making the monsters . Even though they did look cool and the feedings were well , a little lame . Honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made . My final rating 0/10 .  
  With a title like " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes ! " , anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a ) a bad science fiction movie or b ) a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies . It 's supposed to be a mix of both , with a dose of parody splashed in . Unfortunately , it falls flat very soon . You 're never supposed to take this movie seriously , I realize that , but you 're supposed to think it 's funny , right ? I found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny ( i . e , the side-by-side phone conversations , the Russian Olympic spy eating steroid cereal , Superman walking by Lois , etc . ) . " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " strives to be a cult classic , but it doesn't make it . A cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it ( or a similar description ) . " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " could be enjoyed by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor , so therefore , it does not qualify as a cult film . There is one good actress in the entire thing : Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild . She is a thin , gawky reporter , but has an endearing personality , loves to overact , and is a natural comedienne . Unfortunately , she is put to bad use here . " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " is not as funny as , say , " Amazon Women on the Moon " or " Kentucky Fried Movie " , but it does have a few hilarious moments , so I would still recommend seeing it once . Avoid the director 's cut , it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly " lost " footage dubbed in a pretend African dialect ( it can be found in English on the out of print tape ) .  
  What is this ? A low budget sex comedy ? Anyway it describes perfectly the people in Spain . They could come up with a better idea , I mean they do this kind of movies since the 60s .. and people like them ! This is neither a teen comedy nor a family one ( you can't let your 12 year old watch 2 guys in bed kissing , he 'll never want to go to Spain ) . This should be rated " R " , because only people 35 + seem to laugh watching : S I 'm truly disappointed , maybe I don't like gays ( which is quite an important part of the movie ) . Foreign humor is awful in films ( except Kusturica ) , stick with doing dramas ! If you want a new comedy try Talladega Nights  
  Beyond dirt cheap , this shot-on-video exercise in ineptitude was difficult to get through . It 's got the typical gore that you 'd expect in a zombie movie , but none of the required atmosphere to make it worth while . What 's strange is that this is an amateur German video , and the version I saw is English-dubbed ! The dubbers seem to be American fans ( penpals of the Germans ? ! ) who can't decide whether they want to play it straight or turn it into a comedy . One character ( a white German , of course ) is dubbed by a black guy apparently , who speaks with thick ebonics ! ' Kno wahm sayin ' , Comrad ?  
  A film with very little positive to say for it . Firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama . Besides being remarkably slow The Empty Acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again . I lost count of how many times I had seen " that " field at night or that bit of cracked earth . It also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don't know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused . So with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it 's fine . We find Jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre . Beth has a key to a warehouse of books ? There are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie , much later , in fact too late . And on the point of the acre . Horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary  and also if they 're meant to be an acre big then make them so . There is also a frightening lack of reasonability as Beth ( the best performer in the piece , followed by Jefferson  the cop ) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on " medication " . With the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child ( did he crawl out of the window ? He 's six months old ) the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene . Bad plinky plonk " horror " music fails to add atmosphere . Often bad films can be amusing but not The Empty Acre , which is just bad .  
  Cute and playful , but lame and cheap . ' Munchies ' is another Gremlins clone to come out from the 80s . I 'm not much of a fan of the imitations . First it was the excellent ' Gremlins ' . Then came the very average ' Critters ' . Lets not forget the lousy ' Ghoulies ' . But the complete pits would have to go to ' Hobgoblins ' . Is there more ? Now ' Munchies ' for me would have to fall somewhere between ' Ghoulies ' and ' Hobgoblins ' . Actually I probably found it more entertaining than ' Ghoulies ' , but I preferred thst one 's darker tone . From the get-go it plays up its goofy nature ( which it 's better for it ) , but due to that nature the hammy acting ( Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips ) , can get rather overbearing that you rather just see the munchies running amok . That 's where the fun occurs . Mostly light-hearted fluff though , as the story mainly centres on the munchies ( who are either hungry , horny and destructive ) in a whole bunch of supposed comical encounters ( some moments do work ) in the small desert town as a couple of people are on the chase . It 's silly , but strangely engaging thanks to the zippy pacing . The creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed , as they 're basic dolls being chucked about . Where their personalities arrived from is that they can actually speak .. and with attitude . Charlie Stratton and a feisty Nadine Van der Velde ( who was in ' Critters ' ) were fair leads . Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles . Robert Picardo also pops up . Amusingly low-cut entertainment for the undemanding .  
  Most would agree that the character of Wolverine is one of the most intriguing characters in comic book history . I 'm no Marvel expert , but I did grow up with the adventures of the X-Men and definitely approved of Hugh Jackman 's now widely known portrayal of the scruffy Logan . I enjoyed the first X-Men , found the sequel too heavy and messy and liked the third one as comic book entertainment . All through the three movies , I probably enjoyed Jackman more than anything else . I figured the idea of making an " origins " - movie about Wolverine could very well end up being a better movie than all of the three X-Men movies . If we concentrate on one character , I figured there could be a movie that achieves what I found the second movie failed at - being a fairly complex and character driven comic book adventure . The reason that the Wolverine-movie fails is not because the competition is tougher after The Dark Knight . It 's not even because of a plot development that is beyond obvious and rudimentary - even though that certainly isn't good - no , it 's because the movie doesn't even seem to try . To begin with , this does not qualify as good entertainment . There is something about the action in this movie that comes off as so very , very automatic . With no greater special effects or elements of suspense , and when one event will make you predict the following five , it almost feels like an Uwe Boll movie , imitating an action / adventure movie concept that you 've seen a dozen times before . Of course , nothing in this movie is as downright awful as a piece of Bolls * t but when everybody 's talking clichés as if they are part of a chain of events that is so standard , you at least make the connection and that surely is bad enough . But there is an even bigger problem . Even a generic action movie is a generic action movie and , by the way , that makes you forgive a lot of plot holes and character stupidities . I think you find the most fundamental flaw in the very title . I mean , " Origins " . Really ? What to the people behind this movie think about that title ? What do they mean ? You want to know the origins of Wolverine ? He grew up with his brother . They ran away from home during dramatic circumstances . Then they went off to war . All of them ! The Civil War , World War I and II and Vietnam too . Why did they do this ? Still unknown . Eventually , the brother ( Sabertooth , played by Liev Shrieber ) became evil . " How ? " you ask . I don't know , it was somewhere between Omaha Beach and Hanoi . " Yeah , but why ? " you still ask . I just said I don't know ! The movie doesn't explain . He 's evil alright ! " Yeah , but .. you know , ' origins ' " .. Yeah , well that 's an origin ! I mean , duh ! Anyway , eventually they end up with a super secret team of mutant elite soldiers . Something with the government , ho-hum . Wolvie gets enough and leave his brother . For six years he 's a happy lumberjack with a loved one , who ends up a little defenseless around the time Sabretooth suddenly appears again . " Yeaah .. but .. whyy ? " - Oh shut up ! - and Wolvie decides to be a guinneapig for a bunch of evil scientist who make him a flesh-covered metal war animal . He goes after all the bad guys and they come after him and after all the fighting he ends up with his memory wiped , cue X-Men the first movie . There . That 's the origin . You can also find it on the back of the DVD cover . The actual movie won't tell you anything else . With no worthwhile scenes of action , no good heroes , villains or characters in general ( lines from my couch audience : Fat suit ! Token black guy ! Oh , I give you 200 in cash if that girl survives this movie .. , That is supposed to be Gambit .. ? mmhm , yeah well .. uh-huh , right ) , not one line of memorable dialog and zero lines to cover a T-shirt with , added to that the common stupid things that ruin the plausibility in general that you might usually forgive .. well , that sounds pretty much like a waste of time , right ? Fans will check this out , or have already . There 's no stopping that . But if you liked the X-Men movies for no other reason than that they were well-made and entertaining - see them again and do yourself no favors by trying to look for origins where there are none .  
  Ted V . Mikels 's film Corpse Grinders 2 is 103 minutes of excruciating cinematic swill . The plot is pretty much a mixture of nonsensical business dealings among people who grind corpses into cat food while cat aliens , who are losing a war with dog aliens , looking to get some of this cat food . Watching this movie , I began to look for any kind of distraction , anything to reassure myself that I was doing something else besides losing my mind from the inside out . Several scenes go on for far too long , as characters take forever to do simple things . I 've heard that Mr . Mikels doesn't like to use jump cuts too often , fearful that they will confuse his audience . I 'm not sure if this attitude is " avant-garde " or just " stupid . " Try as I might , I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters in the unnecessarily huge cast , well with the possible exception of the old men who are the caretakers of the factory . The majority of the cast are a bunch of no-talent amateurs who don't even bother to learn the lyrics to " Amazing Grace " before they have to sing it on camera . Although perhaps the blame should go to the poor sound quality , since I only actually heard around 80 % of the dialogue while watching the DVD . This is quite possibly the worst film to ever be shot . I 've listened to snippets of the commentary , and Mr . Mikels comes off as a surprisingly sweet old man , what the hell was he doing making this kind of trash ? I 'd like to hear the explanations from the old men who had to lie shirtless on a metal conveyor belt waiting to be ground up . Movies I 've long hated suddenly seem a lot better . I long for the intermittedly appropriate music of Excalibur , and the consistent lighting of Dawn of the Dead . I need to go do something , anything . Don't see this movie .  
  I am a big fan of old horror movies , and since I am middle aged , old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920 's to 1960 's period . I am not a big fan of more modern horror movies , with one exception being Creepshow 1 , which I thought was great . I could reminisce about the stories there but I really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with Hal Holbrook , and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending . All the stories were great though . So why did I like them so much ? The characters had some decent development , the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad , the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear , and the funny bits were really funny ! This sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent ! I am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on IMDb . com , lol . When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get top billing it 's telling you something .. 4 of 10 . Also , Romero 's expertise is hard to find here , they must had told him to tone it down to a PG standard ( I don't know what this was rated at but it looks PG to me ) , and that 's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on . It 's shown on the Encore cable channel if your dieing ( yuck yuck ) to see it .  
  This film was slow but tedious and the acting often drifted into the land of ham . Redgrave 's character was unappealing as the 60 something woman trying to compete with Thurman 's 20 something for the love of Fox 's character ( why is beyond me ) . The title of the movie should have been " Shallow people on the lake " . The actors played like they were in a rehearsal . A dreadfully predictable ending to boot . I can't believe this is on this website as a comedy !  
  This is another one of those ' humans vs insects / eco-horror ' features ; a theme that was popular in the late 70 's . Only you can't really call it horror . There 's zero suspense and no gruesome events . In other words : this movie is pretty lame . It 's not that it 's really bad or something ; it 's just very boring . A construction site near a hotel uncovers a big nest of ants . Later on we learn that , probably due to different sorts of pesticides used in the past , their bite became poisonous . Some people get bitten and rushed to the hospital and it takes ages for the residents of the hospital to figure out what 's going on . Robert Foxworth figures it out first and then you can see him go berserk with a digging machine for what seems like several hours . Then they flee in the house , waiting to get rescued . And , man , you should see all the efforts they make for rescuing them . I won't spoil too much , but at one point they even use a big helicopter . All the time when I was watching this , I sat there thinking " Come on , people , you all got shoes on . Just run out of the building . I 'm sure a bunch of ants won't catch up with you . " It 's all pretty ridiculous . Of course , lots of close-ups of crawling ants are shown throughout the whole movie . Ants in the garden . Ants in the garbage . Ants in the kitchen . Ants on the roof . Ants in the bedroom . Ants in the sink . And the best part : Ants crawling on people 's faces while the actors are breathing through straws . But when you see groups of ants in wider shots , they indeed look like black rice the set designers glued to the wall . One small surprise came near the end . No , it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot . It was just that Brian Dennehy made an appearance as a chief-fireman . Ehrr .. What more can I say ? This movie is called IT HAPPENED AT LAKEWOOD MANOR but the box-art of my copy read ANTS and the title during the opening credits was PANIC AT LAKEWOOD MANOR . There you have it . Now , since this is a made-for-TV movie from the 70 's , I 'll be once again extremely mild in my final rating . Now , THE SAVAGE BEES , another ' humans vs insects ' TV-movie from 1976 was much better than this one . I even feel I have to go back and add a few points to its rating after having seen ANTS . Lacking suspense , action , thrills , shocks and creepiness , the only thing you 'll be left with after seeing ANTS is an annoying itch .  
  Is there a book titled " How to Make a Movie with Every ' Man vs . Nature ' Cliché Imaginable " ? If not , Ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects . Ants doesn't have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime . I suppose the most surprising thing about Ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes . The set-up , the characters , the various sub-plots , the death scenes , and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases , much better . It 's amazing that so many of these Insects on a Rampage films were made in the 70s because they 're all basically the same movie . And can someone please tell me what in God 's name Myrna Loy is doing in this monkey-turd of a movie ? A woman as talented and classy as Loy deserved better than Ants as one of her final movies .  
  this by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life . I gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot . the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot . my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it . borrowing some ideas from movies like Resident Evil and Aliens doesn't result in a movie like them . if this going to be a top Korean movie , I 'd rather won't bother to see even a Korean movie trailer .. By the way , this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising . I think every Korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the 8 , even though has no clue what it is about .  
  I already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a satire , there were numerous political and social messages , the names make refer to some other names etc . It might be . I cannot realize such things ( I don't want to do anyway ) because I am not interested in , I am interested in ' cinema ' . As for the movie itself , again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful . I could not see anything which we don't see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half . Yes , that scene says somethings about humanity , but it does not make the movie brilliant . The movie is entertaining ( mildly ) and exciting in some moments or scenes , but no more than that . As for the biggest flaw of the movie , it is visual effects . It was just shocking , I could not pull myself together for a while , because I had expected a realistic monster , because it is not one of the old Gojira movies , it was made in 2006 , but it was not . It is like if you don't believe that there is a monster , you cannot care about . If you agree with me about this , I highly recommend you Cloverfield that is extremely realistic . The design of the monster is not interesting , but at least planned , there is an effort . Dramatically powerful critique . Some critics talk about it as if it is a Kurosawa movie . Yes , it is rather a drama than a thriller or action , but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful . I don't want to compare The Host with other monster movies , but I try to mean that The Host does not do something that other monster movies do not do . By the way , may be some people call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for Asian cinema . Yes , I like Asian cinema too , but this is the fact .  
  What a terrible movie . Rotten tomatoes had a good rating for this too . don't be fooled by the positive comments ; It wasn't scary . It wasn't funny . It wasn't clever . It won't even hold your attention . I just wasted 2 hours of my life viewing this crap-fest . the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple times . after about 15 minutes it no longer entertained . the dialogue was terrible , must be a translation thing . another negative that stood out was the idiot Americans . 3 were portrayed and they were all lacking character , intelligence and judgment . Now I will write a couple of lines to pad this since we have to have 10 . The employees at the video store should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter .  
  I read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly . I have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful . It pains me to write that since I would have hoped this would have been great , or I wouldn't have bothered to see it the other day . I like supporting indie cinema , especially if they are gay-themed , but this movie is almost too much to tolerate . Those that walked out , as I considered doing after about three minutes , probably didn't mind shelling out $ 11.00 , or just figured it was going nowhere , fast , and not going to improve . Maybe I am slightly more optimistic than they are .. either that or they didn't pay to get in in the first place . Logan is bored . He 's a klutz . He 's gay . I 'm okay with that . The problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also ! There are ENDLESS scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of laundry , re-establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene , and the second scene , etc . , etc .. Nothing or no one goes anywhere . NO ONE says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting . Probably most appalling of all is that I didn't feel the slightest bit of empathy for Logan . That in itself is a major accomplishment . He didn't grow , he didn't change , he didn't learn ( there is no one to teach him anything ) , he DIDN'T DO ANYTHING , and neither did the movie ! Scene after scene of the same thing do not a movie make . Additionally , the title makes no sense at all . 1/10 .  
  Well OK , I watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now I pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and I must say , I actually think this movie is good . This movie caught a buzz as the bootleg I Know What You Did Last Summer 3 , much like Final Stab was to Scream 4 , and well this movie isn't that bad . I mean it had flaws and of course it would be laughable to release this in the theaters but still for a midnight popcorn flick , this movie is not half bad . It has some scares , and some really hot women I might add . Plus it shows off Joey Lawrence 's new beefy look though obviously even that hasn't won him any big Hollywood roles either .. I feel bad for the man , he had such a career in the early and mid 90 's with blossom , some Disney movies and the everlasting Lawrence brothers show .. Joey Lawrence was a bit player in the sitcom scene , but then like in a 360 degree turn , his career went south only doing low budget movies like this one . The movie also throws you off guard in , it makes you think between the crew , there really is a secret that someone knows , to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret . It also throws you off on who the killer is , I had an idea but still woulnd't think the killer was who he was , but his motives combined with the secret was a huge letdown . Now , had there been a secret that was let out ? This movie could 've been one of the better b rated movies . But also I am a sucker for college themes and I also in college went on spring break in a mansion sized beach house similar to the one in here so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie . A so-so slasher flick . Good for a midnight movie .  
  It was one of those late night " It 's there " I saw it things . Sometimes they are great . This one was awful , but it really shouldn't have been . The movie had a really good cast . How can you fail when you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallance ? We 're talking Oscar winner turf here . It had good special effects . It even had some really good tits ! And I mean nicely shown , full breast with full nipple and at one point even some beaver . But it didn't compensate for the one missing ingredient - a story ! The plot was ludicrous . I don't mean the " solar crisis " sun exploding stuff , but that was bad enough . It was the rest of the stuff - the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil corporation stuff . Man that just STANK ! No amount of good acting or cool space ships or fight scenes could get around that one . I have seen the same cast members be incredibly good . I have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets . All the difference is in the writing .  
  90 minutes of Mindy .. Mindy is a tease to boyfriend Bill .. Mindy prances at the high school dance .. Mindy hitchhikes to Big Sur , shoplifts a loaf of " shepherd 's bread , " Mindy nearly gets gang-raped .. Ah , the pleasures of Crown International drive-in features . You must remember that these films were never designed to be watched start to finish on DVD players . They were made as 90 minutes of ambiance so the teens of the 70s would have a soundtrack as they got it on in their Pintos and Citations . The lack of pacing and structure didn't matter to the original audience - they probably only tuned in when the T & A on screen matched what they were up to , out in the parking lot . The film is really irritating when watched as a story . It 's a lot more fun to talk about it than watch it . My favorite inanities : 1 ) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy . With no luggage or change of underwear , they spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher , just like in real life . 2 ) After being abducted and nearly raped by depraved bikers , and after their innocent friend " Pan " is savagely beaten , Mindy and her girlfriend find an unattended motorcycle on the road . Mindy immediately brightens up and chirps , " I 'm going ' to Big Sur ! " But again , it 's a lot more fun to talk / read about than sit through .  
  It 's always tough having a sibling doing better in their life than you , always a struggle to get out from under that shadow and not let bitterness keep you away from your family . So , imagine that your older brother is Santa and then imagine how tough that must be . That 's the premise here . Vince Vaughn plays the titular Fred , an embittered loser who spends a lot of his energy making sure that people don't go around expecting good things to happen to them or giving his brother , Santa ( played by Paul Giamatti ) , too much praise for simply being the limelight-hogging , fame-hungry , slightly creepy guy that Fred would want to portray him as . Then , wouldn't you know it , Fred needs a financial favour and so has to make up for it by helping his brother on the run up to Christmas . And hilarity and life lessons ensue . Well , that 's what should happen . The reality is that we get a Christmas movie featuring a few good moments of Vaughn 's patented fast-talking , a ridiculously out-of-nowhere music video moment , Kevin Spacey playing an auditor out to close down Santa 's operation ( and he 's one of the weakest baddies I have seen in some time ) , not enough of the gorgeous Elizabeth Banks in a lush Christmas outfit , too much of John Michael Higgins in his elf outfit ( to be fair , he 's a highlight though ) and a movie that 's too swimming in bitterness to feel like good seasonal fare yet too schmaltzy in it 's latter half to feel like a fun poke at all the bad things about the commercialism of the time . Rachel Weisz is along for the ride too , as is Kathy Bates , but it 's really nothing more than a movie for Vaughn and if you like his style you will find something to enjoy here . Unfortunately , there 's very little else to recommend this seasonal stinker . Outside of Vaughn 's rantings the script barely throws up anything decent with the exception of one particularly good scene involving a hilarious support group dealing with a very specific problem . David Dobkin 's direction is as mediocre and staid as the 20p Christmas card that you send the auntie you haven't seen in 10 years and he seems to think that simply putting the ingredients together without a good mix or decent care taken will guarantee a delicious Christmas pudding . Nope , we get a burnt , bland lump with too much sugar on top . Forget this and stick the hilarious Elf on again if you want a great , modern Christmas comedy . See this if you like : The Santa Clause 2 , Santa Baby , The Santa Clause 3 : The Escape Clause .  
  Well , I have to say , this movie was so bad that I would have walked out if i didn't have to review it for work . ANd the worst part is , I wanted to see it so badly that I drove all over the city , paid $ 10 parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong . Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does - the only time I 've seen him play someone else was in that movie with John Travolta . Anyways , the plot has potential - it sounded great in the preview , but it is filled with totally ridiculous , predictable , weak plot turn points . And I was hoping that this would be one Christmas movie where Christmas DIDN " t have to be saved , and that Santa didn't need a replacdmetn , but nope . The only cool part was the sleigh rides , and the little bladck kid was the best character . I 'm sure this movie would be great for young kids , but for adults it 's so lame that it 's chore to sit through .  
  After just watching FIVE ACROSS THE EYES , I gotta be honest .. I just didn't like it . I had read so many good reviews on this movie , but I just did'nt get where these reviews have came from , I have got a lot of time for newcomers into film-making , and I 'm sure the directors will do well for themselves , but the budget they had was the main problem , there was two cameras used in the entire film ( which was OK ) but they seemed like really cheap cameras . Another problem was the sound , you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time , all talking on top of each other - it 's just impossible to hear what they 're saying . It had a good idea going for it , in a nutshell , they hit a parked car then drive off , a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit , driven by a mad woman , who wants to kill them , and has plenty of chances to do so ! .. and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape , but don't ! Very frustrating .. I only just scraped through this one !  
  Yeh , I know - you 're quivering with excitement . Well , * The Secret Lives of Dentists * will not upset your expectations : it 's solidly made but essentially unimaginative , truthful but dull . It concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be dentists and who share the same practice ( already a recipe for trouble : if it wasn't for our separate work-lives , we 'd all ditch our spouses out of sheer irritation ) . Campbell Scott , whose mustache and demeanor don't recall Everyman so much as Ned Flanders from * The Simpsons * , is the mild-mannered , uber-Dad husband , and Hope Davis is the bored-stiff housewife who channels her frustrations into amateur opera . One night , as Dad & the daughters attend one of Davis ' performances , he discovers that his wife is channeling her frustrations into more than just singing : he witnesses his wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera . ( One nice touch : we never see the opera-director 's face . ) Dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation , divorce , and custody hearings - profitable only to the lawyers - Scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his wife 's indiscretions . Already , the literate among you are starting to yawn : ho-hum , another story about the Pathetic , Sniveling Little Cuckold . But Rudolph , who took the story from a Jane Smiley novella , hopes that the wellworn-ness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashy , postmodern touches . For instance , one of Scott 's belligerent patients ( Denis Leary , kept relatively - and blessedly - in check ) will later become a sort of construction of the dentist 's imagination , emerging as a Devil on the shoulder advocate for the old-fashioned masculine virtues ( " Dump the b-h ! " , etc . ) . When not egged-on by his imaginary new buddy , Scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include his wife engaged in a three-way with two of the male dental-assistants who work in their practice . It 's not going too far to say that this movie is * Eyes Wide Shut * for Real People ( or Grown-Ups , at least ) . Along those lines , Campbell Scott and Hope Davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the glamourpuss pair of Cruise and Kidman . Further , the script for * Secret Lives * is clearly more relevant than Kubrick 's . As proof , I offer the depiction of the dentists ' children , particularly the youngest one who is about 3 or 4 years old , and whose main utterance is " Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! DAD ! " This is Family Life , all right , with all its charms . The movie would make an interesting double-bill with * Kramer vs . Kramer * , as well . One can easily trace the Feminization of the American Male from 1979 to 2003 . In this movie , Dad is the housewife as in * Kramer * , but he is in no way flustered by the domestic role , unlike Dustin Hoffman , who was too manly to make toast . Here , Scott gets all the plumb chores , such as wiping up the children 's vomit , cooking , cleaning , taking the kids to whatever inane after-school activity is on the docket . And all without complaint . ( And without directorial commentary . It 's just taken for granted . ) The film has virtues , mostly having to do with verisimilitude . However , it 's dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions , which culminate in a long scene where a horrible five-day stomach flu makes the rounds in the household . We must endure pointless fantasy sequences , initiated by the imaginary ringleader Leary . Whose existence , by the way , is finally reminiscent of the Brad Pitt character in * Fight Club * . And this finally drives home the film 's other big flaw : lack of originality . In this review , I realize it 's been far too easy to reference many other films . Granted , this film is an improvement on most of them , but still . * The Secret Lives of Dentists * is worth seeing , but don't get too excited about it . ( Not that you were all that excited , anyway . I guess . )  
  Man oh man ! What a piece of crummy film-making ! But this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though I hate to admit it . They showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time . Where I grew up in San Jose , California ( right on the border of Cupertino ) we had this thing called The G Channel on our cable system . And they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again . Wanda Nevada was one of those movies . I fell in lust and love with the young Brooke Shields and loved her dopey adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s . The script makes almost no sense , the direction is poor , the few highlights are that Henry Fonda makes an appearance , a lot of dialog that 's so bad it 's good and a nice Carole King song played over the end credits . Maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick . And hey , everybody knows there ain't no gold in the Grand Canyon !  
  I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I think " The Wild Women of Wongo " is worse . This is an exercise in patience . It 's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist . There 's no plot . There 's no logic . There is certainly no acting ( although the shark has some quality dialogue ) . We don't wonder about anything . We don't know how people got where they got . It 's always amazing to me how things like this even get released . I agree with the previous writer that it isn't even funny bad . I know . It 's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a DVD collection . It 's like a paperweight . Or a bad painting you bought at a starving artists ' sale . It covers the crack in the wall .  
  .. Ever . This is the bottom . I am not joking . The theater should 've had a warning of some kind . ' Abandon all hope ye who enter here ' would 've been fitting . I don't have the words to describe accurately the hell that this movie is . Its debilitating stupidity even fails to amuse . This movie is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox . The story was blatantly stolen from a 10 minute Bugs Bunny cartoon and then stretched like Mr . Fantastic to 90 excruciatingly painful minutes . I remember when the Wayans 's were funny . I guess the pressures of Hollywood for them to produce produce produce are to blame for the poop that churns out at a consistent rate . I 'm sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kick in the balls jokes with a thin plot based on a cartoon . I disliked nearly everything about this movie . I won't spoil anything but the baby is actually a midget with Marlon Wayans 's face poorly superimposed over the midget 's body . What I DID like was the ending . Not the movie 's resolution , but the actual end where we all stood up and walked out . I gave this movie one star , but it clearly deserves less . I don't feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script is worth a star . This does deserve a Razzie and I pray to God it gets it . When are people going to learn ; if you stop paying to see this idiocy they will stop pooping it out . Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film . Avoid it at all costs . You have been warned .  
  I 've now just realised that by watching this film I have lost valuable precious moments of my life I will never get back . Thsi film isn't just poor its dire . It reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made . I regret watching this film . Flixmedia reckons its a race issue , apparently " White " people don't like it because it doesn't have white actors . Mate , I think you 'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivel . Please stop making crap films  
  Yes there are great performances here . Unfortunately , they happen in the context of a movie that doesn't seem to have a clue what it 's doing . During the first 45-60 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance . Suddenly , about an hour in , the characters who , until this point , had always spoken to each other , suddenly start singing to each other . To further confuse things , a little further in , out of nowhere , they actually do about 15 minutes of sung-through dialog , then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things , such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section . On top of all this inconsistency in how the music is used , is the composers ' clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed . While the first couple of pieces do sort of mimic the 1950s Motown sound , the rest of the film is just ( bad ) Broadway show music . Then there 's the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad Jackson family imitation and Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie . When he started channeling Stevie Wonder I couldn't help laughing out loud . This was clearly one of those films that make me appreciate how little time I have on earth and resent that I wasted two hours of it watching this film .  
  The acting was horrible and they got both of the sports wrongg .. not only did they get the figure skating rules wrong , but also they rules of GIRLS Ice Hockey . In GIRLS ice hockey you cannot check . You also don't BLOCK for someone . Not all they girls are disgusting gross mean and big . I play hockey and I 'm only 4'11 and have been asked to go to schools like the one in the movie . Also not all hockey players hate figure skaters . A lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves . Also we skate A LOT faster then the ones in the movie . I was embarrassed by the movie it gave people the idea that we suck .. although i must mention that it is difficult to transition between the sports because of the toe pick on the figure skates .. also some of those twirly moves KAtelin was doing on the ice you couldn't do in a regular hockey game . She basically tripped the person , which is illigal . Its also unrealistic that she would get a HOCKEY scholarship when she figure skates . That really made me angry that scholarship would normally be used to someone who could benefit the team .  
  Yes , In 35 years of film going I have finally viewed the stinker that surpasses all other ghastly movies I have seen . Beating ' Good Will Hunting ' Baise Moi ' and ' Flirt ' for sheer awfulness . This is pretentious blige of the first order .. not even entertaining pretentious bilge . The effects are cheap , and worse - pointless . The script seems to have been written by a first year film student who doesn't get out much but wants to appear full of portent ! The acting is simply undescribably bad - Tilda Swinton caps a career filled with vacuous woodeness with a performance which veers neurotically between comotose and laughable ' intensity ' . Apparently , some fool out there has allowed the director of this film to make another one .. be warned  
  This is actually a pretty bad film . The ideology is not as perverse as in those films Collins made later . However , my main misgivings about the film are that it is implausible and quite frankly boring for a long time . The whole concept of an ex-SAS man joining terrorists for no particular reason isn't very convincing and you can't help wondering why a group of highly organized terrorists ( who later become pretty clueless ) fall for it . The film starts with a pretty powerful scene but then meanders for quite a long time building up towards the great finale . Overall , I think Who dares wins could have been an interesting 45 minutes episode of The Professionals but the story doesn't carry a feature film . Although reasonably successful at the time this film initiated the demise of Collins ' career who in the eighties mainly made cheap and dubious soldier-of-fortune or army films . Pity , because he actually is quite a versatile actor but at the end of the day Martin Shaw chose his roles more carefully and has a career that 's still successful .  
  Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both excellent actors , who can certainly rise to any acting challenge put to them . Unfortunately ' Watching the Detectives ( 2007 ) ' offers only one to both actors and audience alike : not to fall asleep during a mind-numbingly boring , very predictable and unimaginative story . ' Watching the Detectives ( 2007 ) ' tries very hard to be funny , but the comedy is forced , extremely poorly directed and embarrassing to the verge of complete ridicule . After a third of the film still nothing that may capture even the most willing audience , like the director 's friends and relatives , is even hinted at , not to mention actually happening . I 'm pretty sure everybody who liked it faked it or had to fake it like Neil 's ex-girlfriend did when he showed her an old B & W film she couldn't care less about . ' Watching the Detectives ( 2007 ) ' is nowhere near category B , it falls somewhere between Q & R , like - Questions ? and - Repress the questions ! The director knows what he 's doing ! Well , if his goal was to bore the viewer to death , he has done a very good job ! ' Watching the Detectives ( 2007 ) ' was a complete waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy , bur PLEASE don't let it be a waste of your time ! Rating : 0 out of 100 .  
  WARNING : This review contains SPOILERS . Do not read if you don't want some points revealed to you before you watch the film . With a cast like this , you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into . Did they see the script and say , ` Hey , Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail . ' Unfortunately , it does . Did they even think to check on the director 's credentials ? I mean , would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called ` Satan 's Cheerleaders ? ' Greydon Clark , who would later go on to direct the infamous ` Final Justice , ' made this . It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer ` Final Justice ' and completely miss out on ` The Return . ' The film is set in a small town in New Mexico . A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam . er . a spaceship appears and hovers over them . In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film , the ship spews some kind of red ink on them . It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it , so right away you are treated with cheese . Anyhow , the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children . Elsewhere , we see Vincent Schiavelli , whom I find to be a terrific actor ( watch his scenes in ` Ghost ' for proof , as they are outstanding ) , who is playing a prospector , or as I called him , the Miner 1949er . He steps out of the cave he is in , and he and his dog are inked by the ship . Twenty-five years go by , and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd , who works with her father , Raymond Burr , in studying unusual weather phenomena . Or something like that . Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town , and she travels there to research it . Once she gets there , the local ranchers harass her , and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on , and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue . From this point on , the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other , especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier . While this boring mess is happening , Vincent Schiavelli , with his killer dog at his side , is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item . You know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trick-or-treaters at Halloween , the kind that you shake to make them glow ? Schiavelli uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in people . It 's the second-worst effect in the movie . Every time Schiavelli is on screen with the glow stick , the scene 's atmosphere suddenly turns dark , like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that enhancement . It ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it is . And what does all this lead up to ? It 's hard to tell when the final , confusing scene arrives . See , Burr and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that Shepherd found as some kind of ` calling card , ' but none of it makes sense . Why do Shepherd and Vincent age and Schiavelli does not ? Schiavelli explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants Shepherd dead , but even that doesn't make much sense when you really think about it . I mean , why doesn't he kill Jan-Michael Vincent ? After all , he had twenty-five years to do it . And the aliens won't need him if Shepherd is dead anyhow , so why try to kill her ? Speaking of the aliens , it is never clear what they really wanted out of Shepherd and Vincent . What is their goal ? Why do they wait so long to intervene ? How could they be so sure Shepherd would come back ? Not that the answer to any of these and other questions would have made ` The Return ' any more pleasant . You would still have bad lines , really bad acting , particularly by Shepherd , cheesy effects , and poor direction . Luckily , the stars escaped from this movie . Cybill Shepherd soon went on to star in ` Moonlighting ' with Bruce Willis . Jan-Michael Vincent went on to be featured in dozens of B-movies , often in over-the-top parts . Raymond Burr made a pile of Perry Mason television movies right up until his death . Vincent Schiavelli went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films . Martin Landau , who played a kooky law enforcement officer , quickly made the terrific ` Alone in the Dark ' and the awful ` The Being ' before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently . You can bet none of these stars ever want their careers to return to ` The Return . ' Zantara 's score : 2 out of 10 .  
  Looking through the other comments , I 'm amazed that there aren't any warnings to potential viewers of what they have to look forward to when renting this garbage . First off , I rented this thing with the understanding that it was a competently rendered Indiana Jones knock-off . What I got was one of the most offensive movies I can remember trying to sit through , made all the more shocking by the movie 's comparatively high production values . I don't think this is a spoiler , but if it is , be warned .. If your idea of entertainment is watching Bimbo getting raped from behind by Fearsome Tribal Chief , while she is staring into the dead eyes of her significant other 's severed head , by all means , rent this flick . If not , I 'd advise you to look elsewhere for entertainment . Come to think of it , that scene so succinctly sums up the movie that there 's nothing else I really need to say about it .  
  This movie fails miserably on every level . I have an idea , let 's take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east . Maybe if we 're lucky they 'll all be shot and killed and we won't have to ever have our time wasted by them again . Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life ? My god , I can't think of anything I 've ever seen that was this bad . I 'd rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film . If I ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film , I 'll spit in their face and then beat them senseless . That 's my two cents .  
  This is just a joke of a movie , they lost me already at the opening scene ( Spoilerwarning ) dangerous creature kills other creature in his cage , this is watched by a scientist that works there on a monitor and guess what she does , well lets go in to the cage to check the stuff out , omg how dumb do those writers think human beings are come on thats the same like jumping in a fish tank with a great white shark because it ate your goldfish .. Pretty useless and even more dumber . And i will not even talk about the cast because they aren't worth the effort . why they didn't fired the guy that wrote that immediately is a mystery to me .. And this kinda dumbness continues the entire movie . Only good thing where the cgi that is better then average for these kinda low-budget movies . If these kinda things don't bother you go see it , but be warned if your IQ is above 60 you will probably hate it .  
  Avoid the USA version . It is with added US footage and the worst dubbing you 've ever heard probably done by New York amateurs . The dubbing is so bad that it sounds like Mystery Science Theater 3000 . I think a black guy from the Bronx does Chiba 's voice . I couldn't watch the entire film it was that bad . Instead of this Americanized version watch Chiba 's other greats like The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors .  
  I am marking this as a " spoiler " only because of some of my comments of the show 's content , not to the content itself . As I read the comments it is apparent that those Republicans somehow tolerate the show , but disdain it , while the Democrats seems to relish in its so called truthfulness . One reader even ( so it seems ) actually indicates that he believes these events did or could have happened when Bush was in grade school . But as to the content as I see it , trying to be neutral , is that the group that made this series must actually be really Bush haters . In the Episode that I saw last , s02e03 , it showed that the program must have been put together long before McCain became the front runner for the nomination ; because , the other former front runners are all featured . Another thing that caught my attention , was the use of add in closets . I thought that the series must have been made in Europe of for sure not in the U.S.A. , because I know of no home the U.S.A. that does not have built in closets , and most likely in the homes of the artists . As I watch the show , yes I do get caught up in it , I am amazed to see what must be a terrific desire of the writers to do what they can to embarrass our President . Sure there are problems as most American will agree , but that is no reason to be so hateful in public displays seen around the world . Perhaps the trend has now been set by this show and network , so that IF Obama or Hillary got in , would they continue to produce and air the same sort of " humor " about them ? Just one more comment on a commentator 's remarks . IF there had been some sort of change in the election back in 2000 , according to that writer , he was so sure that there would be a completely different acceptable president . Wow , wishful thinking on his part . As far as 911 events , I do believe that it was set in motion back when Clinton was president , and I can't see how if Gore was president anything would be much different .  
  When anti-bush jokes get really easy to do , a show like this had better make sure it has something extra . When that something extra is kid versions of political figures making jokes about the future they don't have yet , it 's just plain nonsense . Dick Cheney and George Bush are done well but Dick Cheney mutters mostly . There 's also Condoleeza Rice who has a crush on Bush for some reason and Donald Rumsfeld who isn't really that similar to Donald Rumsfeld at all . The democratic characters rarely give their names so it 's a mystery as to who could be who aside from Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton . The episodes have coherent stories but that 's not nearly enough to keep this from sinking .  
  Well here I go with another B industry movie . It 's sad enough to see some badly made films but I don't care if a B industry or C industry produces the film . Show some effort in your work . The characters are really bad . The acting isn't in question in this one ( surprise ) , but plot is . How can a tight-knit squad witness two of their fellow soldiers butchered , and then go on as if nothing happened . What sickened me was how the writer even threw in the remaining members a scene where they joke about how nice the doctor 's ass was . Give me a break .  
  Very bad film . Very , very , very bad film . It 's a rarity , but it defenitly is not worth hunting down . This Italian Jaws rip-off makes little sense most of the time , and no sense the rest . The " alligator " is not at all convincing , and many of the sub-plots go nowhere . If it 's at the local video store , you may want to watch it if you 're a fan of monster movies , but it 's not worth hunting down .  
  This was a movie that I hoped I could suggest to my American friends . But after 4 attempts to watch the movie to finish , I knew I couldn't even watch the damn thing to close . You are almost convinced the actual war didn't even last that long . Other 's will try to question my patriotism for criticizing a movie like this . But flat out , you can't go from watching Saving Private Ryan to LOC . Forget about the movie budget difference or the audience - those don't preclude a director from making an intelligent movie . The length of the movie is not so bad and the fact that it is repetitive - they keep attacking the same hill but give it different names . I thought the LOC was a terrible terrain - this hill looked like my backyard . The character development sequences ( the soilders ' flashbacks , looking back to their last moments , before being deployed ) should have been throughout the movie and not just clumped into one long memory . To this day , I have yet to watch the ending . But there was a much better movie ( not saying much ) called Border .  
  This film was the most longest film and the record breaking film for sure It had 30 actors After JAANI DUSHMAN ( 2002 ) i guess no one had the guts to do something like that The film as the title suggests is based on the Kargil war but the problem is there are too many characters and the romantic subplots and the songs of many characters are boring Even there are too many cinematic liberties like killing people with knifes , wonder which soldier does that ? Direction by JP Dutta pales front of BORDER Music is okay Amongst the huge cast Ajay Devgan stands tall , Saif is very good in his part and also it 's his first film with kareena , Abhishek is likable Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanju is wasted , Suneil is okay Akshaye Khanna does his part well rest are passable Rani is good , Esha is okay rest are passable  
  If you have seen very less films , this might be a big one for you . If you have seen lot of films , this is a joke . The acting of real heroes is portrayed very badly . Not to mention , there are songs , there are lot of flashbacks , and most importantly , the fighting scenes are stupidily performed . New characters , good direction , would have done a better job , but since it contains all the bollywood heros / heroines , you can predict whats going to happen next . You do not feel sad when something happens , the emotions they protray is terrible , mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other hindi movies . It suppose to be a realistic movie , but it fails to show . There are times you wondering , you have thousands of army vehical filled with soldiers moving and the pakistanis are bombing at them and none of their bomb hits them . Are the pakis really bad at aiming or the director made them look stupid ? There were only a few characters acting that was very good , but as far it is concerned with plot , action , it is poorly directed . This movie could have been short if they took out songs , flashbacks , stick to the point .  
  i checked this one out on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile as this dreadful movie unfolds . every time that you think it cannot get any worse , it inevitably does . The acting is absolutely horrific . the plot makes no sense at all . The title " cold vengeance " in the US DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script . The action scenes are so obviously taken in their first take . There are lots of mistakes during dialogues indicating that there is just no intend to do another take to at least try to make this movie bearable . I cannot remember having seen a worse movie and I do occasionally get bad ones-well , except for unstoppable with Wesley Snipes . No , who am I kidding , while a bad one , Unstoppable deserves Best Picture awards at the Oscars when compared to this piece of crap .  
  I saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie . The only thing I did see was Quentin Tarantino 's seeming insane obsession for it .. There were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality . Overall however , I found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous . The hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks I found clumsy and dizzying , even sickening . Overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological warfare of the U.S. military against various malcontents . The various vignettes that made up the movie are haphazard in their placement and unfulfilling and unresolved in their content and " conclusions . " A depressing movie ( not a true _ film _ , a term I reserve for true art ) that left me with a bad feeling . Do not believe the various people that try and spin this as a " romantic comedy " though there are certainly isolated elements of both this movie repudiates in content , form , and conclusion any association with this genre . I suggest staying far away notwithstanding the seemingly overwhelming positive views of IMDb and other ratings sources .  
  I like a movie that has at least a vestige of a story . This doesn't occur in this movie . It 's a series of vignettes with no cohesion . There are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans . A woman with a blond wig never removes her sun glasses . This woman shoots at other people at the beginning of the movie and we never find out why . She disappears completely after about 30 minutes . There is another coquettish woman who endlessly cleans a man 's apartment . There are endless scenes at a fast food joint where the Mamas & Papas ' California Dreaming ' is vastly overplayed ( I used to like the song ) . The dialogue is mostly concerned with food ( pineapples , chef 's salad and ordering drinks ) . I assume most of the actors gained weight during this movie because a lot of fast food was consumed . There is no passion in this movie because there is no story . This is purportedly a romance - it is no such thing . I just wonder why I didn't hit the Fast-forward . I kept waiting for something significant to happen  it doesn't . Maybe that 's the only consolation to this movie - scenes shifted so rapidly that it tricked you into assuming that there was going to be a revelation to all the nonsense .  
  I have read all of the Love Come Softly books . Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book , but generally they at least have the main point of the book . I was highly disappointed in this movie . The only thing that they have in this movie that is in the book is that Missy 's father comes to visit , ( although in the book both parents come ) . That is all . The story line was so twisted and far fetch and yes , sad , from the book , that I just couldn't enjoy it . Even if I didn't read the book it was too sad . I do know that Pioneer life was rough , but the whole movie was a downer . The rating is for having the same family orientation of the film that makes them great .  
  In the first Howling , we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized . The plot in that film made some sense ; a TV reporter investigates this and attempts to uncover the truth . She ends up having to kill many of them including her boyfriend who becomes one . Then she shows the world that they do exist by transforming on live TV . The special effects were just laughable in the first movie and they don't get any better in this one . Whether it 's the transformations or the bad puppets or the cheesy computer graphics showing the superpowers . The plot line isn't all that bad ; they must kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason . This won't destroy all werewolves and it really doesn't end the threat from werewolves as it .. they just want to kill her . I think there was some cloudy reason for this but it really gets lost in the film . After the film " ends " we have a 10 minute montauge of the movie we just watched and every other scene is one where the female werewolf leader rips off her top exposing her large breasts while some Devo-esquire band plays to a crowd of werewolves . The only thing that makes this movie even watchable is Christopher Lee .  
  Ugly shot , poorly scripted and amateurishly paced sequel to Joe Dante 's 1981 classic . " The Howling " is one of the two or three ONLY good werewolf-films ever made and yet it got ' rewarded ' by a series of obnoxious and unendurable sequels like this one . If it 's any consolation , " Stirba " is a sequel in name only and there 's absolutely no connection with the characters or events that were introduced in Dante 's film . The plot here revolves on a bloodthirsty cult of Transsylvanian werewolves  primarily female ones  led by Stirba . Stirba is played by Sybil Danning who transforms from a curvy old lady into a blond super-babe ( with impressive bosom ) in the blink of an eye and becomes all hairy when sexually aroused . Her arch-enemy is played by a seemly fatigue Christopher Lee . His character  Stefan Crosscoe  is an occult investigator who travels to Stirba 's kingdom , accompanied by an American couple who lost their friend to the werewolf cult . In case you 're exclusively looking for filthy gore and gratuitous nudity .. this is your film . Even the smallest killing is shown in great detail and we 're even treated to exploding eyeballs and the vile image of a dwarf who gets pierced on a pointy fence . However , if you want a little substance or depth , you 'll be sorely disappointed . The dialogues are embarrassing and there 's absolutely no tension to detect anywhere . The scriptwriters constantly seem to confuse werewolves with vampires ( the Transsylvanian setting , garlic , wooden stakes .. ) and Danning 's gorgeous balcony is shamelessly exploited as the film 's only gimmick . During the end-credits , a shot in which she rips off her top , is re-edited repeatedly ( according to my fellow reviewer Dr . Gore , no less than seventeen times ! ) which is pretty pathetic and pointless . The music is okay and some of the scenery is rather beautiful . I 'm talking about the fierce-looking statues during the opening credits and the dark dungeons of Stirba 's castle . The directing by Philippe Mora is a giant mess and  as far as I 'm concerned  his only worthwhile film remains " The Beast Within " , released three years earlier .  
  This movie is phoniness incarnate , a straight 11 / 10 on the phoniness scale . The fakeness of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering . Yanks , although the real Scotland may be just as colourful , if you ever go there don't expect to be given much of a the chance to " dance out " controversies with the locals . Also , don't attempt to sway local opinion through the otherwise fine art of tapdancing . There are a couple of infectious singing-and-dancing scenes , but the plot is far too cheesy and linear , and the dialogue is often too weak . I also doubt whether anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped 18 . th-century Scottish village in the boondocks rather than gay New York City . Maybe it wasn't such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left Brigadoon , maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dump . Watch it for the fine alternative-reality view of what a Christopher Streed Day-parade in Scotland would look like on LSD . Other than that I 'd only recommend it to Hollywood muscial completists .  
  Where is it written that sequels must suck ? Scream 2 didn't ! Others didn't ! But this one sure did .. problems include horrible actors ( only Christopher Walken could act in the entire film ) , bad writing ( you will never understand what 's going on and I even have done research on the idea of Nephilim before ) , and just horrible choices for casting . Eric Roberts makes the stupidest Archangel Michael that I have ever seen in my life ! Avoid it like the plague unless you are desperate to see Christopher Walken . In that case just fast-forward to the parts where he is in the film , and avoid the others . Yech !  
  The prerequisite for making such a film is a complete ignorance of Nietzche 's work and personality , psychoanalytical techniques and Vienna 's history . Take a well-know genius you have not read , describe him as demented , include crazy physicians to cure him , a couple of somewhat good looking women , have his role played by an actor with an enormous mustache , have every character speak with the strongest accent , show ridiculous dreams , include another prestigious figure who has nothing to do with the first one ( Freud ) , mention a few words used in the genius ' works , overdo everything you can , particularly music , and you are done . Audience , please stay away .  
  I first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my TiVo system . I like Danny Elfman and thought it might be interesting . On top of that , I 'm a fan of Max Fleischer 's work , and this started out with the look and feel of his 30s cartoon . With both of those , I thought it would hold my interest . I was wrong . Just a few minutes in , and I had the fast forward button down . I ran through it in about 15 minutes , and thought that was it . Afterwards , I read some of the other reviews here and figured I didn't give it enough of a chance . I recorded it again and watched it through . There 's 75 minutes of my life I 'm not getting back . I can't believe there aren't more bad reviews . Personally , I think it 's because it 's hard to get to the 10 line comment minimum . How many ways are there to say this is a waste of time ? The movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts , profanity , and puke jokes . The characters are flat . The parody of " Swinging the Alphabet " is lame , essentially cobbling the tune , getting through A - E , hitting the obvious profanity a " F " , and then having no idea where to go . The trip through the intestines to the expected landing doesn't work the first time , let alone the following ones . Across the board , the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to " out-South Park " Stone and Parker without the ability to determine what is and isn't funny . This might be amusing if you 're high . Otherwise , it 's not .  
  Much like Orson Welles thirty years earlier , Mike Sarne was given " the biggest train set in the world " to play with , but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his train set become a train wreck that is still spoken of with shock and a strange sort of awe . Despite post - modern interpretations purporting somehow to see it as a gay or even feminist tract , the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in 1970 and remains one today . How anyone given the resources at Mr Sarne 's disposal could have screwed up so royally remains a closely - guarded secret . Only Michael Cimino ever came close with the political and artistic Armageddon that constitutes " Heaven 's Gate " . Both films appeared to be ego trips for their respective directors but at least Mr Cimino had made one of the great movies of the 1970s before squandering the studio 's largesse , whereas Mr Sarne had only the rather fey " Joanna " in his locker . Furthermore , " Heaven 's Gate " could boast some memorable and well - handled set - pieces where , tragically , " Myra Breckinridge " s cupboard was bare . Simply put , it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that feeds in the history of Hollywood .  
  Ed Wood is eclipsed and becomes Orson Welles . This film is fantastic . Vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking ribs with laughter . Plan 9 From OUterSpace dons't stand a chance against this . Described by the writer and psychic Stephen Armourae on the Vampire Forum as a masterpiece - he 's from England and thoroughly sarcastic . It has Stephanie Beaton and the producers know whats going to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using her . Though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil raisers . And Eileen Daly is just a lower rate Elvira . The whole thing is badly done . Watch it for the script though  
  but " Cinderella " gets my vote , not only for the worst of Disney 's princess movies , but for the worst movie the company made during Walt 's lifetime . The music is genuinely pretty , and the story deserves to be called " classic . " What fails in this movie are the characters , particularly the title character , who could only be called " the heroine " in the loosest sense of the term . After a brief prologue , the audience is introduced to Cinderella . She is waking up in the morning and singing " A Dream is A wish Your Heart Makes . " This establishes her as an idealist ( and thus deserving of our sympathy ) . Unfortunately , the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about . Freedom from her servant role ? The respect of her step-family ? Someone to talk to besides mice and birds ? In one song ( cut from the movie but presented in the special features section of the latest DVD ) Cinderella relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more efficiently . You go girlfriend ! In short , Cinderella is a very bland character . She passively accepts her step-family 's abuse , escaping into her unspoken dreams for relief . She only asserts herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family . For this , she is given permission to go the ball if she completes her housework and finds something to wear , a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except , of course , Cinderella . Can anyone see Belle or Jasmine being such a doormat ? If Cinderella is dull , her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless . The Prince in Cinderella gets no dialog and almost no screen time . We are given no indication if he is a good man , if he respects Cinderella or anything . All we know is 1 ) he is a prince and 2 ) he dances well . Heck , even the prince from " Snow White " got to sing a romantic song at least . Not only does this lack of development make the romance less interesting , it makes Cinderella look like either a social climber or an idiot , weakening her already tenuous appeal . Perhaps realizing how dull the main characters were , the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movie 's comic relief , Cinderella 's friends , the mice . Granted , these characters are amusing . Even so , when the comic relief steals the show from the principals , well , let 's just say your story has some problems . Dinsey loves to proclaim all its animated features as " masterpieces . " While many of them are , there are some that do not deserve this appellate in any way . Cinderella is a prime example of this fact .  
  A female country singer nicknamed " Big T " - seriously , that 's what they call her-risks her budding musical career and her life by falling into the company of a sleazy drunkard ( Busey ) who wants to be her manager . His mother committed suicide , his father 's an alcoholic as well , and he has a violent temper . You can imagine where that leads . In the meantime , there 's music aplenty , as Parton , with her fluid vocal talents , belts out song after song ( at least half a dozen of them about Texas ) . Steer clear of this mess and check her out in NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead .  
  If Alien , Jurassic Park and countless other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea , add a lot of sugar and you 'll get this one down . The film begins in jolly old England around 1100ad and then jumps to present day California . Our hero Carver ( Dean Cain ) is the new Security Chief and Military Advisor for a Science Lab 400 feet underground . He arrives ( Carver is also a helicopter pilot ) with the lead Scientist and we soon find out it 's a cloning lab and they have something newly found to clone . Is it a Dinosaur or what ? As with the above movies , all hell breaks loose and our characters start getting picked off . The special effects on the Monster are pretty good for a " direct to video " movie and Dean Cain does what he gets paid for . But forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before . Again , don't go in with high expectations and you 'll be ok .  
  A propaganda film for the Palestinian " cause " . If you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , you will need to look elsewhere . If you are an anti-Semite ( or merely an anti-Zionist-nothing wrong with advocating the destruction of a country , right ? ) or uncritically in support of Palestinian goals ( e . g . , mass murder , the destruction of Israel ) , this is the documentary for you . Should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the UK and US . However , any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged at the sheer number of lies presented in this video . I just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation aren't corrupted by this anti-Semitic filth .  
  Because ' cruel ' would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers . Where do you even begin ? In a spout of b * tchiness , I 'm going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie . Scratch that . Nearly does not belong in that sentence . I can't think of even one character who was portrayed well . Although , in all fairness , it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way . Still , the girl who played Katherine ( whose name I purposefully don't include - I 'm pretending she doesn't exist ) remains one of the worst actors I 've ever seen , only eclipsed by the guy who played Sebastian . The story was God awful . It attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways . Pretty much every part of it was pointless - though I will admit ( grudgingly ) that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise . And the ending was at least slightly humorous . But this film is up there with the worst I 've seen . Don't watch it . Just don't . There is absolutely no value in watching it . None . It only takes away the enjoyment of the first .  
  Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again . If he does he should be arrested on the spot .. at the very least for petty larceny . Anybody who pays even a dime to rent any of his garbage should file a claim and be compensated . This was innocently my first viewing of his " work " .. and it will my last . Ed Wood looks awfully good to me right now . When I return this piece of crap to the video store , I will personally ask that it be taken off the shelf . An active supporter of gay cinema , I am incensed and angered that this warped , exceedingly untalented man-child be allowed to distribute and package something like this , with a coltish pretty boy on the cover ( Jamie Brett Gabel , who , thankfully , has no other acting credits in IMDb ) and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait , and then market it as a " movie " rental . Trust me , this has no place being on any rack anywhere ; it is simply not a movie in any sense of the word . Offensive , irresponsible junk such as this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema ( hell , gay rights in general ! ) For those tempting to rent this out because of the cover , you WILL be disappointed . Gabel is not as flattering to look at on film as he is on the cover , and he appears once or twice without a shirt - that 's it . Instead , the homely Mroavich inflicts on us his own disgusting , sorry-looking dough-boy nakedness . This " thing " he " assembled " is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich . Both he and his friend Michael Habousch ( who , I understand , puts out similar sleazy garbage ) are terrible in this . Mraovich is purposely posing as a complete no-talent ( in all fields ) , desperate to grab onto any " loser " attention he can for himself . He is to be pitied .  
  I have no idea what on earth , or beyond , could have possibly made Sam Mraovich believe that this would have been a worthy project to undertake . Ben & Arthur is one of the worst movies ever made . In fact , I see no reason why it should not be at # 1 on the Bottom 100 . For although I have not seen , for example , SuperBabies : Baby Geniuses 2 ( # 5 at the time of this publication ) , I would venture to guess that that film is considerably better than this oozing wound , because even in its vapid dismalness at least Baby Geniuses 2 was professionally made . By contrast , everything , and I do mean everything , in this film is completely unprofessional . The movie is intended to be an attack on the Christian Right 's supposed bigotry and hatred toward gays . And I do emphasize " intended . " Not only does it completely and utterly fail at its purpose , it also leaves an ugly scar . Instead of creating a compelling and realistic portrait of a gay couple 's struggle against a society that largely opposes them , it creates tired , crass stereotypes of each party involved . Ben and Arthur , the namesake couple , are portrayed as two crude , sex-starved , and hopelessly romantic cardboard cutouts who marry when the laws change to allow them to do so . This meets with the opposition of Ben 's brother Victor , a Christian minister who , like all Christians ( as this movie would have us believe ) , is loud , prying , stupid , and violent . He tries to kill Ben and Arthur after his associations with them get him kicked out of the ministry . Just like in real life . And if you think that 's dreadful ( it is ) , you haven't seen it all . The actors ( ? ) here manage to completely destroy any vestige of credibility in this movie by saying their lines as if they were narrating a YouTube home comedy video . But not even Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brando as the title characters could have saved this clunker , for there would still be the matter of the completely inane and laugh-inducing dialogue that fills every minute of the movie . Every scene has at least one awkward or misplaced quote . For example , in one scene , Victor tries to complain about not being able to have nieces or nephews because of his brother 's homosexuality . But instead of portraying this idea clearly , he spits out the stupid , utterly confusing , whiny-sounding line , " You know what , I 'm never going to have any nieces or nephews , okay , because you 're so F * ED UP ! " Even more glaring is the complete lack of production values . Yes , I know this ain't The Dark Knight , but even amateur film makers should know some basics about special effects and editing . For example , six dots of red cake dye do not suffice for realistic bullet wounds . People do not teleport across a room between takes . And objects do not fall FORWARD when shot ! Do not waste your money on Ben & Arthur . I don't care if you 're 7 , 17 , or 107 . I don't care if you 're gay , straight , bi , or undecided . I don't care if you 're " just curious . " I don't care what pathetic reason you may have to be tempted to buy this dung-heap . Stay away , far away . This movie 's only redeeming quality is its ability to be used as a Frisbee .  
  This Film was done in really poor taste . The script was really bad . I feel really sad for the late Gregory Peck who took on the title role of this B-movie adaptation of one of history 's greatest generals . The movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the Japanese in World War 2 . There was a scene where I almost vomited , it showed Macarthur in a bunker in Corregidor island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded , one legged Filipino soldier . The soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says : ` no papa , no mama , no uncle sam ' and Macarthur gives his little pep talk that Americans ` would never abandon ' the Philippines . The scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by Macarthur 's words and gives him a smart salute . I mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the U.S. as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake . It showed that Filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great Americans solely for redemption . It blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the USAFFE ( United States Armed Forces of The Far East ) , these are Filipino volunteers that were integrated in the US military during world war 2 , who died side by side with the Americans fighting the Japanese , who walked side by side with Americans in the death march of Bataan and defended Corregidor island by launching a guerilla offensive after Macarthur left for Australia with his famous ` I shall return ' speech . My late grandfather , a Filipino world war 2 veteran and USAFFE soldier was one of the many who fought the Japanese with honor and love for the home country . I think this movie does not give honor to them and to the thousands of others that Macarthur relied on for intelligence preparations for his famous return in the Leyte gulf landing .  
  I have seen this movie many times , ( and recently read the book the movie is based on ) and every time I see it , I just want to slap all four of them . The fact that they don't clue in to the fact that Tom Hank 's character is flipping into his D & D ( oops M & M ) : ) persona ( " Oh , he 's just acting in character . " ) outside of the gaming session . That and the fact that after three months of therapy , let 's just destroy all that and feed his delusions ! These kind of people are what give RPGs a bad name . Also the corny ' love ballad ' , and the music done by ' cat on a piano ' and ' stop us if we get too annoying ' are almost enough to set your teeth on edge !  
  Its unfortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movies of all time in my book . This poor copy steals lots of material from the first three films going as far as even copying how persons die and what will happen in the future to the key characters and it basically tries to cram in three films into one and fails . It fails even to create a good scary atmosphere for one ( except with the odd exception where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old films ) . The only thing we can be thankful for is that there has not been an Omen V .  
  This is a truly wretched little film . Admittedly the original ( un ) holy trinity was governed by the law of diminishing returns with the third , " The Final Conflict " degenerating into a ridiculous sub-plot about half-way through the film apparently merely to provide the requisite needlessly convoluted deaths that had by now become the whole raison d'etre for the " Omen " series . But then to foist this jumped-up TV movie ( beware purchasers of the Omen box set on DVD - don't be fooled by the widescreen ratio of the transfer , this was and is strictly small-screen stuff ) on the back of a series of generally fine demonic chillers was unforgivable , particularly , endorsed as it was , by the exec . producer and producer of the first three movies Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard . I 'd give-away the plot if there was any , besides the usual death scenes ( hopelessly toned down for TV sensibilities ) and some of the worst acting I 've seen . All involved in this project down to the catering people should be ashamed this travesty ever made it to the screen , let alone masquerading under the Omen name . If one person is convinced by my review to avoid this mess , I 'll feel better for it .  
  There is a key aspect of film that Jobson seems to have forgotten - it has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you . You don't need to tell the audience what to think , because they 'll see it . The action here is interspersed with some of the most ponderous narration unleashed on the unsuspecting public - the purple prose of the sensitive fifth former . And it should be unnecessary because their is a fine cast here and some beautifully composed and shot visuals . Maybe Jobbo felt that the basic story needed a lit bit of support . And he may have been right , it lacks a basic credibility : 70s Edinburgh wasn't exactly full of beautiful brainy girls with a penchant for the Velvet Underground and a soft spot for a passing sociopath . From the too neat and new looking clothes that character wears to the cod intellectualism that tries to link it all together , it 's all too contrived for my taste .  
  This appalling film somehow saw the light of day in 1988 . It looks and sounds as if it had been produced 20 or 30 years earlier , and features some of the worst songs ever included in a major motion picture . I weep for the parents and children who paid top dollar to see this .  
  Mona the vagabond lives on the fringes of French society , in a life without meaning , purpose or direction . I watched this because of all the stellar reviews , but I 'm afraid I must have missed something . The character of Mona has little or no personality while drifting through life being rude to people , getting high and contributing nothing to anyone 's life . She 's not interesting or exciting . She 's just useless . I 've seen and known enough people like that : there is no secret meaning to what they 're doing . They are just lazy bums . I wouldn't want Mona anywhere near me , as she tends to steal anything that isn't nailed down and leave her friends in the lurch . Sure she 's enigmatic - because there isn't anything to her . Lots of junkies , winos and bums I 've seen are enigmatic ; I wouldn't want to see a film about them either . Possibly there is something there that I totally missed . Otherwise I 'm assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a French female director is high art .  
  According to IMDb , as well as to every other website that holds a review ; this " thing " doesn't have a director . Well , that would surely explain a lot ! Just a bunch of people that gathered together to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in an ultra-thin storyline about devil-worshiping and women sacrifices inside the walls of a secluded sanitarium . " Hardgore " is a prime example of totally demented 70 's smut , as it 's really made with a minimum of production values and scripting inspiration . Horror movies about satanic cults were hugely popular during the early 70 's and pornography as well , so why not combine the two ? Here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac girl who 's committed to a mental asylum , and from the first night already , she 's drawn into a network of drugs , psychedelic orgies , rape , torture and dildo-action . Really , a LOT of dildo-action . The friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her , but she has her throat slit even the same night . The horror aspects are truly poorly elaborated , going from laughably un-scary Satan masks to virulent severed penises attacks . The photography and acting performances are almost intolerably amateurish , but what do you expect from a film that features footage of sperm-firing dildos and talking amputated male reproduction organs ? Leading lady Justina Lynn is a rather good looking girl with a ravishing body , but most of her co-stars ( male & female ) are hideous and excessively haired sleaze balls .  
  Shame Shame Shame on UA / DW for what you do ! I was appalled . Do NOT take kids to see this movie . The humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they 'll be bored and disappointed . Certainly * we all * have read Theo 's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations .. but this is pure trash . Dr . Seuss would be ashamed and certainly would 've never given his " thumbs up " at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic . What a pity . Spend your money on the book . If you own a copy , then buy the book and donate it to a Toys for Tots program . This movie is NOT worth a " free " ticket viewing . Stick with the book . The tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal - save your money .. seriously . SAVE your money - it will be on cable by saint patty 's day . Shame shame shame on what they do !  
  Most movies I can sit through easily , even if I do not particularly like the movie . I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre . This is the first movie I could not stand to watch . Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seen-and I 've seen a lot of movies . The acting is okay ( Myers is good as the cat , it 's just that he is REALLY annoying ) . The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous , even for the children in the audience . The plot drags on and on , and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue . The " witty " parental remarks are disgusting , not funny ( I remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to , well , a type of person people call a " ho " ) . Even though the movie is really short , it seemed to last FOREVER . Do not waste your time . I know small kids who hated this movie . If children can't stand it , I do not know how any adults can . I would like to fume more about this film but I do not even feel like wasting anymore time writing this review about it . I HATED IT ! So , in summary , do not spend 90 minutes of your life watching this ! See a GOOD movie ! 1/10 stars-the lowest review I have ever given a movie .  
  The sun was not shining , it was too wet to play , so I went to the movies , that cold , cold , wet date day . " The Cat in the Hat " was the name of the flick , and when it was over , my stomach was sick . Mike Myers played the Cat , his humor was lame , and kids needn't see this , the humor was not tame . the film was like drinking milk , from a rabid cow , so it IS fun to have fun , yet the filmmakers didn't know how . This film , in short is atrocious . The acting was bad , the plot was tweaked too much , and the humor was surprisingly very crude . It starts with Conrad and Sally , A rule breaker and a future sheriff . When their Mother has to go to work , she gets Mrs . Kwan to babysit . Possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when Mrs . Kwan is watching a Taiwanese court room , a ` la C-SPAN . She soon falls asleep , and here comes the Cat . The film starts to spiral out of control . The Cat came to try to let the kids have some fun . He 's got Thing 1 and Thing 2 , Who suddenly start trashing the house . He improvises a TV Infomercial , and accidentally slices his tail off . And when the Cat goes full Carmen Miranda , it 's not funny . Possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist . And there 's a fish who tries warning the kids about the Cat . Too bad he didn't warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk , or chopping your tail off . Soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog , who has the key to a crate on his collar . If the crate is not locked soon , their house will be home to the Cat 's universe . Here it gets a little more interesting , but not enough to save the film . The acting , overall , is horrible . Mike Meyers brings his brand of irreverent Austin Powers humor to the Cat , Saying things like " You dirty ho " and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata . Spencer Breslin is great as the trouble-making Conrad , and Dakota Fanning is cute as Sally , though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous Aortic Dissection waiting to kill John Ritter ( accident waiting to happen ) . Alec Baldwin 's slick and slimey Lawrence Quinn is disgusting , ever trying to woo the kids mom , who is played by Kelly Preston . And Sean Hayes is Mr . Humberfloob , Mom 's boss , and is also the voice of the fish . The latter three are also bland . Overall , if I were a parent I would not take my kids who are into potty humor , cause there 's plenty of it and more . Save your $ 7.00 and see something else . As the late great Dr . Seuss once said , It is fun to have fun , But you have to know how . Really , Universal , stop ! Theodore 's already turning over in his grave . Like my Mom always says , " Curiousity killed the Cat " . - The Cat In The Hat * out of *  
  Don't get me wrong , I assumed this movie would be stupid , I honestly did , I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet . The only reason I even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going ( different story for a different time ) . As I began watching I noticed something , this film was terrible . Now there are two types of terrible , there 's Freddy vs . Jason terrible , where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is , and then there is a movie like this . The Cat in The Hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me . As I watched the first bit of it not only was I bored senseless , but I felt as though I had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie . Mike Myers is usually brilliant , I love the majority of his work , but something in this movie didn't click . One of the things that the director / producers / writers / whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book ( red , black , white ) on any character but the Cat . Coincidentally or not , they also refused to capture any of the original ( and i hate to use this word , but it fits ) zaniness of the original . The book was like an Ice Cream Sunday , colorful and delicious , and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust . Avoid this like a leprous prostitute .  
  I wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV . I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40 . I regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when I could of saw something better . The beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches . They exaggerated the way love works in reality . All of the girls were stereo types . The boyfriend was too stupid for his own age . The passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having barely got any laughs . The bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies . Their getaway car was an old beat up Chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks . Hey why didn't they get nice girlish vehicle for the robbery instead ? It might have boosted the audience opinion about the movie . This movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed . This movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive Christian people nuts . Hey I even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but I but there was never any . So I rate this movie b which stands for low budgeted and 1 out of ten stars .  
  I 've seen the movie only recently , although it appeared in 2001 . I hoped to see an entertaining movie , but let me tell you , Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi . The " princess " is not very talkative , as you may have noticed .. She reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme , who only stared to make his point , then beat the crap out of the opponents . During the entire movie , I waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked , why was she fighting , who did she love and trust . I waited in vain . Crappy movie . Crappy dialog . Don't watch it unless you want to be bored out of your minds ! It 's so bad , that in the end I was wondering how I managed not to scream in frustration 1 and a half hour . Approximately . I give a 4/10 .  
  This film ends with a speech in which the narrator tells us the fates of two of the lead characters and that the names of people and places have been changed .. before telling us that relation to actual people and events are purely coincidental . This ending line actually sums up everything that has gone before it ; as Rino Di Silvestro 's messy film completely lacks vision , and if there is any point to the plot ; it wasn't put there on purpose . Werewolf Woman is often seen as a guilty pleasure or a ' so bad it 's good ' film , but I completely disagree . Normally , I enjoy films like this ; but Werewolf Woman is indeed a bad film , and despite all the sex and savagery on display ; it doesn't even make for a fun watch , and that really is unforgivable . The film really doesn't have much plot , but the thin sliver we are given involves a young woman , who also happens to dream that she is a werewolf . She dreams of going out and finding men , having sex with them and eventually killing them . Back in the real world , she falls in love , but her lover is killed and she goes out for revenge .. The film is made up of scenes of sex and gore , which are padded out with extremely dull talking sequences in which various characters mull over the recent events . These scenes are probably there to forward the plot and build characters ; but they really don't do that , and succeed only in turning what could have been a passable exploitation romp into an extremely underwhelming film . It would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot , and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice . The sex scenes are often overlong and not very erotic , but the gore works well . The premise is ripe for giving way to a very sexy slice of exploitation , as there 's plenty of naked women , and the fact that the central character has a werewolf origin means that there could be plenty of erotica ; but this isn't capitalised on , and while I can stomach huge doses of bad acting and poorly done plot lines , I really can't stand watching films and being bored . Overall , I wouldn't even recommend this film to big exploitation fans . There 's plenty of better stuff than this out there , and while the title may sound intriguing - the film isn't .  
  I 'm guessing the writers have never read a book of any kind , much less a Dickens novel , and certainly not David Copperfield , and that they based their screenplay on another poorly written screenplay , possibly an adaptation of Copperfield , though just as likely anything else , from which they randomly discarded about a third of the pages and then shuffled the rest , along with some random pages from a screenplay that someone 's eighth grade nephew had written for an English class , and for which he had received a failing grade . If the casting was a bad joke - e . g . , Richards as Kramer playing Micawber - which it was , then the direction and acting were the poorly - delivered punch lines . Getting beyond Kramer as Micawber , if possible , Ham was such a complete ogre , hunch-back and all , that I was half expecting at some point to see him being pursued by an angry pitch-fork and torch wielding mob of villagers . Uriah was almost as much of a clown figure as Micawber . Mr . Murdstone evoked about as much terror as that Muppet vampire from Sesame street . The actor playing older David was , I believe , actually a woman . In any case , looking perpetually as if he wished he could find a mirror to see how pretty he looked , and fancied that he looked quite pretty indeed , he could scarcely convince us that he was writing with a quill pen . And while we 're on that subject , in one of the many gross inaccuracies perpetrated by the half-wit producers of this embarrassment , in the unnecessary shots of David writing his story he appears to be somewhere between 18 and 21 years old , when he should be in his forties . Perhaps the greatest transgression , although it 's difficult to choose , was the invented showdown between David and Murdstone as he courted a third wife in Switzerland , preceded of course by the invented death of Murdstone 's second wife . While they were at it it is a wonder they didn't send Heep to the guillotine , and have him deliver Sidney Carton 's famous last words . It couldn't have made things much worse really . It might have been far far better . There are literally thousands of small and large sins against literature throughout this miscarriage of art , and anyone who watches it runs the risk of severe and permanent damage to all aspects of their sensibility .  
  Predictable plot . Simple dialogue . Shockingly unemotional performances . But Robert Downey , Jr . is so cute , I gave this " poor man 's afternoon special " a 3 instead of the 1 or 2 it so richly deserved .  
  My God , what an incredible movie it is ! Reminded me so much of the similar scene in Mel Gibson 's movie " We were Soldiers " when " the Company is not lost , they 're just cut off " And the other scene in Pearl Harbour when the British officer says to Ben Affleck " If all Americans are like you , then God help the nation that goes to war with America ! Put all 3 movies together and you would have enough BULLSHIT to fertilise the entire Sahara Desert . The story of the cut-off Battalion may be real enough but the movie could have done without all that American preachy jingoistic propaganda attached to it . There were audible groans in the cinema during the above-mentioned scene in Pearl Harbour ( no kidding either ) The Lost Battalion however is really in a class of its own  . " Americans think they are unbeatableinspired bravery . " I actually cringed and damn near puked at all the swill being spewed out throughout this diarrhoeic disaster ( the movie that is ) The fighting scenes were well made ( 3 stars for that ) but if the script is manure , then wrapped even in brightly coloured ribbons , it is still manure . The writer , James Carabatsos , also wrote those other screamersHamburger Hill , No Mercy , Heartbreak Ridge . Someone , please shoot him before he writes any more such garbage . The Director , Russell Mulcahy is an Australian too . God , the shame !  
  After reading some very good reviews about this film I thought I would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film I thought I would give it my own review . This is my first ever so bare with me . First of all I would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest ( with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me . ) I would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as I wasn't particularly thrilled either ! The film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times . During these times she visits a house which she has been drawing , after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality . As she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in . Until she adds her constantly away father to the house , due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches . Think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of A Nightmare On Elm Street but is more like a trip to the beach . In conclusion my generous 3/10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab !  
  Alan Alda plays real-life " Sports Illustrated " writer George Plimpton , who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member . Rather wan , uncompelling drama curiously tempered with fantasy . Director Alex March takes an interesting tack on this material , shooting it in a quasi-documentary fashion ( with macho commentary ) and yet giving the tale a touch of Capraesque whimsy ; still , by bringing out the cinematic flashiness in this set-up , he turns the main narrative into a jumble . Alda 's smug , uncharismatic performance is another handicap , though the supporting cast is filled with real-life pro-athletes ( and scintillating Lauren Hutton as Alda 's girlfriend-how 's that for a fantasy ? ) . * 1/2 from *  
  Hubert Selby Jr . gave us the book " Requiem For A Dream " and co-wrote the screenplay to Aronofsky 's movie of it . That movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate , and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them . " Last Exit To Brooklyn " still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives , but it hardly does them the same justice Aronofsky did . The film seems laughably anti-gay at times . Especially when in the film homosexuality equals death . One gay character gets stoned , is launched skyward by a speeding car , and lands dead on the pavement . Another is crucified and still more are simply beat up . Another exaggerated piece of shock value , that might actually have been compelling if it were done well , are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike-breakers . Who 'd have thought a drama about Brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosions ? The director , Uli Edel has a skill level like that of a TV director , but he is far below the cut for real movies . The film is clunky that can't even seem to settle on a genre . Lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and Baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part . And then comes Jennifer Jason Leigh as our lead , a loathsome hooker named Tralala ( believe it or not , I 'm not joking ) . Her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least . Poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is , and also takes the " real " edge off the more provocative bits . A failure .  
  It is not often I watch a film that is as dreadful as this one . I continued to watch , every minute hoping that this was intended as a joke only to find it was meant to be taken seriously . Well , as seriously as this genre requests . The acting was disgraceful and the situations horribly contrived and clichéd . If a film was made in 1920 ( for example ) and had the quality of Hide & Seek ( Cord ) in its direction we would think that cinema back then was naive . As it happens , this film was made in 2000 and I have yet to see a film from the silent era that has as little charm as this one . Definitely not for the serious movie-goer . [ Not worth a rating ]  
  Didn't care for the movie , the book was better . Does anyone know where it was filmed ? * this was my first visit to your site .. just found the answer to my question . so now I look like a dummy , but I think I 'll still submit my comments . and yes , British Columbia is lovely * Or why they took it from its South Carolina Coastal setting ? ( this question stands ) The place was essential to the fabric of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the movie . Oh , I just read where I need to write at least ten lines . Here 's my other main issue with the film . Kim Bassinger was too vapid and not at all what I pictured from the book . I know , the book was the book and the movie ; well not so good . I found the character in the book much more empathetic . Also the book evoked rustic , almost primitive images of the monastery . While the " castle " in the film was much more visually impressive , it distorted the feel of the story and seemed at odds with the characters .  
  Cassavetes was clearly an intelligent , sensitive man with bold new ideas about making films . He wanted to be an auteur , to break away from the confines of the system and bring a new realism to the American cinema . For that , I applaud him . Unfortunately , as a member of his audience , I cannot applaud A Woman Under the Influence . Cassavetes took what could have been a fascinating topic ( an insane woman ) and somehow managed to craft a dull film , filled with lengthy , ad-libbed ranting and drawn-out scenes . He seems to have had a gift for capturing the dullest moments of a person 's life on film , and it often appears as though he simply turned the camera on his family and let the motor run and run . This tactic would be acceptable if Cassavetes had captured something devastatingly REAL - or even a kernel of something so real it touched the heart in ways a conventional film could not . Yet I found the performances , particularly Rowlands ' , to be artificial . I never believed for a moment that she was really insane . I have met people who are truly mentally disturbed , yet I 've never seen any of them act quite like Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence . She played it like a very obnoxious , uninhibited woman who drinks a lot , and even that was confusing because we only see her drink once ( at the beginning ) , but she acts drunk for the remainder of the film . There are some moments in which she taps into something real , but those moments are few and far between ; she fails to sustain a seamless mentally disturbed character . Again , I applaud her efforts , but effort alone is not enough to make the performance ring true . Novice audiences who happen upon this film and see its high IMDb rating will no doubt feel compelled to love it and rate it highly , just to prove that they ' get it . ' But don't be brainwashed by the hype - judge for yourself . You don't have to pretend to like it . Like Woody Allen , John Cassavetes could be accused of solipsism in his film-making , seeming to find his own psyche and his own life experiences so endlessly fascinating that he couldn't imagine that to others they appeared presumptive and tortuously self-indulgent . But Woody Allen at least has demonstrated a gift for keeping an audience entertained - he knows that a compelling story structure and a good dose of humor are essential to any movie . If Cassavetes had employed some self-discipline ( and a sharp pair of editing shears ! ) , A Woman Under the Influence could have stood a chance . But what 's the point of making a ' realistic ' film if the only people who can stand to sit through it are the art-house devotees and film students who worship Cassavetes as some sort of anti-establishment deity ? Without dumbing anything down , I believe Cassavetes could have made A Woman slightly more accessible by keeping the pace moving with an actual plot , instead of presenting a string of 30 minute-long scenes of ad-libbed arguments . If you just make films for yourself and a few of your fans , you 're just reaching the already converted . Watch this movie with your own set of eyes and make your own decisions about it . If you are truly moved and fascinated by it , good for you .  
  This movie offers NOTHING to anyone . It doesn't succeed on ANY level . The acting is horrible , dull long-winded dribble . They obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for . Complete garbage , I can't believe what a laughable movie this was . And I 'm very sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit , a wowing NC-17 movie . The problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the OC or something aimed at teens . Pathetic .  
  Why is it that any film about Cleopatra , the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making ? Whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest Roman of them all , Julius Ceasar , and his successor , Mark Anthony , never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors . Despite lavish sets and costumes , this movie is as bad as any Italian " sandals and toga " extravaganza of the 50 's . Admittedly , this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen , which is why " Gladiator " went over well , but " Gladiator " did not have all the romance novel sex . Miss Varela has as little acting talent as Elizabeth Taylor , but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare . Pity some of it didn't wash off on the others .  
  The movie ' Gung Ho ! ' : The Story of Carlson 's Makin Island Raiders was made in 1943 with a view to go up the moral of American people at the duration of second world war . It shows with the better way that the cinema can constitute body of propaganda . The value of this film is only collection and no artistic . In a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and actors . Watch that movie if you are interested to learn how propaganda functions in the movies or if you are a big fun of Robert Mitchum who has a small role in the film . If you want to see a film for the second world war , they exist much better and objective . I rated it 4/10 .  
  If you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault , then this film is not the film that you want to watch . It was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back . Spoiler : Rosario Dawson turns the tables on her assailant . Instead of using the criminal justice system , the victim resorts to using vigilantism . She in essence nullifies the judicial system . The film " The Accused " was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins . What the " Descent " does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence ? Is victim any better that the accuser ? No !  
  The entire thing is very beautiful to look at .. the European location shooting was a good idea . The lead actors are attractive . The score is servicable . BUT THEN THEY SPOKE ! And the non-plot developed ! And it was all downhill from there . Pacino is sleepwalking and Keller keeps talking about how bored she is .. hello , dear , you 're not alone . When he does a Mae West imitation , you might have to hide your face , its that painful to watch . I can't imagine how either actor or director Sydney Pollack got involved with this , or a better question , why it ended up stinking so bad ? Since death is represented in almost every scene , one way or another , maybe you 're supposed to have low enjoyment here . Maybe its supposed to feel as empty and cold as death . But I still can't recommend it .  
  I love Alec Guinness . And that 's saying a lot after this film . Actually , he is not bad in it . He just seems to stand aside , be urbane and his usual delightful self , but invest nada . It is obvious the girl he is matched with is a featherweight , even as an inexperienced young French girl . Sir Alec wouldn't have chosen her when he was young and very obviously isn't too happy about it now . The interesting character is the brooding brother of the odd " Suzanne " , another twit . " Donald " aspires to be a French Heathcliffe and I waited in vain for the source of his mystery . What deep dark secret was he hiding behind that forehead ? Was he in love with the father 's mistress ? Why did he jerk Suzanne 's hair when she plotted to bring the disparate parts of this turkey together on the country estate ? Or perhaps he had simply had enough of her obnoxious acting . The film would have been charming with Guiness and the " older woman " reminiscing and seeing Paris together . THAT would have been a great story ! Two lovely experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II . Why didn't somebody come up with that ? I suggest watching Alec Guiness in " The Card " , a little known but worthwhile film .  
  The first scene in ' Problem Child ' has a baby peeing into a nun 's face . For this movie , that 's witty . A nasty , mean-spirited ' comedy ' , it 's inept on so many levels it beggars belief . John Ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from Hell , and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one-note , annoying performances and puerile humour . And what the hell 's Jack Warden doing in this mess ? Slackly directed by Dennis Dugan and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when it 's done with the crudity , the movie is made so badly it 's quite a bizarre experience . But never mind all that . The lowlight of the whole thing is Michael Oliver , the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen  believe me , you will want to smack him right in the mouth .
