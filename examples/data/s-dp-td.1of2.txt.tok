  I was going to bed with my gf last night , and while she was brushing her teeth , I flipped channels until I came across this Chinese movie called the King of Masks . At first I thought it was going to be a Kung Fu movie , so I started watching it , and then it immediately captured me in , and I had to finish it . The little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble . She was such a great actor for being so little . Maybe the fact it was in Chinese , so the English was dubbed made it harder for me to tell .. but she really seemed to be in character perfectly . I felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her " boss " but everything just turned out rotten . lol . Even when she brings him another grandson , just so he can pass on his art .. it turns out that kid was kidnapped , so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live . lol .. whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa , just backfires . In the end , he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks .. which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie . Definitely a gem , and totally original . Scott  
  OK , let 's get this clear . I 'm really not into sci-fi , but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1 . Jack O'Neil takes his team SG-1 through a Stargate . A round device that creates a wormhole . It gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds . It might sound like your usual sci-fi-series , but it 's not ! The plot is set today not in some distant millennium like many other sci-fi-series . I find that great . It gives you things , happenings and such you can relate to , and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn many new terms and names of all the gadgets . They have some of course but thanks to O'Neil who likes to keep a simple terminology , there 's not many . The series has a nice blending of action , humor and drama . If you enjoy loads of special effects you 're not going to find it here . They don't use many bad ones but a limited amount of well made special effects .  
  I got in to this excellent program in about season 4 and since then i have seen all the episodes got all the episodes on DVD and keeps getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10 . It now may not have Richard Dean Anderson now but the addition of Ben Browder and Claudie Black it has still given the show more strength and original still even after 10 seasons . Sadly now the sci-fi channel got rid of this amazing show with no hope relay for a 11 season there are making two direct to DVD movie and hopefully more . Atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons . And there is a third spin off in the works the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead . This TV show is a must see for all sci-fi fans and people of genres because this has such a wide range of things to appeal to all ages and all types of people Watch IT ! 10/10  
  An absolute classic ! The direction is flawless , the acting is just superb . Words fall short for this great work . The most definitive movie on Mumbai Police . This movie has stood the test of times . Om Puri gives a stellar performance , Smita Patil no less . All the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment . This movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society . This is the story of a cop ( Om Puri ) who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer . The first attempt in Bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about Mumbai cops . Kudos to Nihalani ! After this movie a slew of Bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal-politician-police nexus . Thus this movie was truly a trend setter . This trend dominated the Hindi movie scene for more than a decade . This movie was a moderate box office hit . A must-see for discerning movie fans .  
  I love this show ! Every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is . I am a huge sci-fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science ( fiction ? ) show in the history of film / TV . There are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion . Its amazing , season after season the show gets better and better . I 've been a fan of MacGyver since i was 5 ( 19 now ) and i find it so ironic that my 2 favorite TV shows of all time star Richard Dean Anderson . Its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other . Back when i first saw Stargate the movie , i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci-fi flicks , then hearing a TV show would spin from it i got really excited , but didn't get showtime till the fifth season was almost over . Though , I 'm disappointed to hear that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio optioned the series instead . Id say though that it turned out just fine . Maybe even better . This show is amazing , and i hope it never dies . Atlantis here we come !  
  Here it is .. the first EVER episode of Friends , Where we get introduced to Control Freak Monica Gellar ( Courtney Cox ) , Newly divorced Ross Gellar ( David Schimmer ) , Hippy Pheobe Buffay ( Lisa Kudrow ) , unknown actor and ladies man ( Matt Le Blanc and very sarcastic Chandler Bing ( Matthew Perry ) . This is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the 6th and final friend Spoilt kid Rachel Green ( Jennifer Aniston ) . The Episode is better than most people give credit for , like any new sitcom the first episode isn't always fantastic . The acting in this episode isn't great because the cast cannot identify and arnt really believable in their new characters ( apart from Kudrow and Perry - who shine ) . Matt Le Blanc - Man , his acting was down right dreadful because until later , he gets more confident , but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails . David Schimmer - Why does he over pronounce EVERY word ? he cannot speak normally ! but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons , but he isn't confident . and i cannot sympathise with him Jennifer Aniston - Looks hot , and does a good job as Rachel Green , but we only see the real Rachel later in the 1st season , Courtney Cox - Looks quite anorexic in this episode , its worrying , she looks totally different now , ( more healthily ) , she acting is a little sketchy but everyones is in this 20 minute pilot ! Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry - I 'm doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb , and for Lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as Pheobe ( Pheebs ) and Matthew Perry is just Matthew Perry playing himself basically ! The episode quality does improve later , such as the Sets , they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem unfriendly , the acting is OK , the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot ! I hope we see the Friends reunite ! cause they will always be there for us !  
  Stargate SG-1 is a spin off of sorts from the 1994 movie " Stargate . " I am so glad that they decided to expand on the subject . The show gets it rolling from the very first episode , a retired Jack O'Neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion , Dr . Daniel Jackson . Through the first two episodes , we meet Samantha Carter , a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her , and there is Teal'c , a quiet , compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team . The main bad guys are called the Gouald , they are parasites who can get inserted into one 's brain , thus controlling them and doing evil deeds . Any Gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a " System Lord . " The warriors behind the Gouald are called Jaffa , who house the parasitic Gouald in their bodies until the Gouald can get inserted in a person 's brain . Through the episodes , we mostly get to see SG-1 , the exploratory team comprised of Jack / Daniel / Teal'c / and Sam , go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets ( this device is called the Stargate ) and they encounter new cultures or bad guys . Some episodes are on-world , meaning that they do not go through the Stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on Earth . Through the years , you start to see a decline in the SG-1 team as close knit , and more character-building story lines . This , in turn means even more on-world episodes , which is perfectly understandable . My rating : 8.75/10-While most of this show is good , there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years . But still , top notch science fiction !  
  I 'm grateful to Cesar Montano and his crew in reviving the once-moribund Visayan film understorey . " Panaghoy " is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular ( that claims more speakers than Tagalog ) . The dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the Philippines . Downside : the corny and stilted acting of the American antagonist . The other item that I didn't appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the " period " costume of the same character , and above all , his bright red kit-car that I suppose was meant to pass for a 1930s roadster . Without those small yet glaring details , " Panaghoy " would 've been at least a 9 out of 10 on my rating-daghang salamat , Manoy Cesar ! Addendum : this film sure beats Peque Gallaga 's " Oro , Plata , Mata " , which provided a different view of the Visayas during the Second World War . Alos , there are some parts where the cinematography harks back to Spielberg 's " The Color Purple " and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of " Noli Me Tangere " .  
  The first installment of this notorious horror series is presented as if it were a snuff film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur camcorder tape , complete with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame . It presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her . The hapless victim is beaten savagely and pelted with raw meat before having her fingernails pulled out with pliers , her hand smashed with a hammer , her eye punctured with a needle , and so forth . In the most nauseating scene , the woman 's captors burn her with hot water and drop live maggots into the burns . The series received a great deal of publicity when American actor Charlie Sheen , believing the series to contain actual murder , attempted to ban its distribution in the United States . An FBI investigation revealed that the films were only what they appeared to be to most viewers - sick re-creations using nasty , but obvious special effects . Gruesomely staged by acclaimed Japanese comic-book artist Hideshi Hino , who also directed the third and fourth episodes , this film is a sure way to clear all but the most tolerant of rooms . But , gorehounds probably won't find anything special .  
  House of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part . A psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game . Have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong ? Watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way . Sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators . You 're never sure of who is exactly who in this movie . This is both a quality and a drawback of the script . As the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency . But all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development . This is definitely one of the best movies about gambling .  
  In the spirit of the classic " The Sting " , this movie hits where it truly hurts .. in the heart ! A prim , proper female psychiatrist , hungry for adventure , meets up with the dirtiest and rottenest of scoundrals . The vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman , and begs to be involved in his operation . While the movie moves kind of " slow " , it 's climax and ending are stunning ! You 'll especially enjoy how the doctor " forgives herself " !  
  House of Games is spell binding . It 's so nice to occasionally see films that are perfect tens . There are few movies I 've seen that can grip you so quickly . From the opening scene this movie just gets you . I 'm trying really hard not to give to much away to those who may not yet have seen this but there will be a FEW SPOILERS SO DON'T READ ANYMORE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW . I would say House of Games is not just a superb film but is the best movie about con artists I have ever seen-bar none . From the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed . Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection , from her mannerisms to the inflection of her voice she gets into the role immediately . Joe Mantegna was also wonderful . The dialogue in this movie has an unforced almost unscripted quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices . I also loved the way the movie was filmed , in that grainy , surreal type of way , it fit perfectly and helped make the film what it was . There were a few movies I 've seen and loved that this reminded me of including The Grifters and The usual Suspects but really , House of games is completely different in it 's way . Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbing characters I 've seen on the big screen and not only do they have screen chemistry that is strong and palpable from the moment they meet , but the buildup that starts from the moment they set eyes on each other is electrifying . You know something 's going to happen but you have no idea what . And just when you think you 've guessed what the " something " is , you realize you haven't even scratched the surface .. House of Games is one of those movies that may be lumped in to a certain genre of movie type but is essentially a movie about human nature . The character study is not just about the mind of the con artist but the victim as well . As the movie moves along and we get to know more and more about the main characters , we learn about them not just through what they say but how they say it . It is a great character study and is flawless in the way it speeds to it 's conclusion . In closing , I 'd rank this 10 of 10 , call it ( although not my absolute favorite film , pretty high on the list ) , most definitely outstanding and would go so far as to say it does rank as one of the best character studies and contains some of the best " twists " I 've ever seen as well . Although I love all types and genres of movies , when it comes to movies of the human psyche , it really doesn't get much better then this . See this movie .  
  Now either you like Mr Carrey 's humour or you don't . Me , Myself and Irene had audiences both walking out in droves and , on the other hand , cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth . Bruce Almighty is a bit more mainstream , but you have been warned . If you 're not sure , watch the trailer . I saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when I saw the film . If you don't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny , don't bother with the movie . Carrey , a reporter stuck in a rut covering ' lighter news ' berates God when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot . God takes up the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better . Carrey gets into the swing of having all of God 's powers by making his girlfriend ( Jennifer Aniston ) ' s breasts bigger , getting himself promoted , and answering everyone 's prayers by single stroke computer commands . This is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable , but it is very well made within it 's very limited intent , provides almost continuous laughs to Carrey fans , and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow-minded god-squadders and anti-god-squadders . On the more thoughtful level , the film tempts us to speculate about Carrey 's own career - stuck in his ' comedy ' typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two Golden Globes . His most accomplished ' straight ' role , the Man on the Moon , is less well known that his comedy romps - or The Truman Show ( on which the Academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing Carrey ) .  
  This was a wonderful little American propaganda film that is both highly creative AND openly discusses the Nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed . While late 1944 and into 1945 would reveal just how evil and horrific they were , this film , unlike other Hollywood films to date , is the most brutally honest film of the era I have seen regarding Nazi atrocities . The film begins in a courtroom in the future-after the war is over ( the film was made in 1944-the war ended in May , 1945 ) . In this fictitious world court , a Nazi leader is being tried for war crimes . Wilhelm Grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal Grimm 's life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks . At first , it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis . However , after a while , it becomes very apparent that Grimm is just a sadistic monster . These episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate drama . All in all , the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second-tier actors . There are many compelling scenes and performances-especially the very prescient Jewish extermination scene towards the end that can't help but bring you close to tears . It was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super-creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first . Overall , it 's a must-see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good film . FYI-This is not meant as a serious criticism of the film , but Hitler was referred to as " that paper hanger " . This is a reference to the myth that Hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper . This is in fact NOT true-previously he 'd been a " starving artist " , homeless person and served well in the German army in WWI . A horrible person , yes , but never a paper hanger !  
  Once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they .. somehow .. managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended , you 'll find that it 's not half bad . The plot is engaging and interesting , and the pacing is fast , with this covering many situations , and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken . Where this really stands out is the acting . The performances are excellent . Neill and Streep are both impeccable . It 's also cool to hear so much Australian spoken in a Hollywood film , and even those who don't come naturally to it at least attempt an accent . The cinematography and editing are nice enough , but they don't really go beyond the standard stuff . This movie 's story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling . While I have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture , I understand that it is quite close to the truth . There is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this . It is , at times , a downright great courtroom drama . I recommend this to any fellow fan of such . 7/10  
  " A Cry in the Dark " is a masterful piece of cinema , haunting , and incredibly though provoking . The true story of Lindy Chamberland , who , in 1980 , witnessed a horrific sight , seeing her 3-month-old baby being brutally taken from their family 's tent , while camping on the Austrailian outback . Azaria ( the baby ) was never seen again , and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world . Meryl Streep does immaculate justice to the role of Lindy , as she always does . But the one thing that helps " A Cry in the Dark " never fall flat is the brilliant direction . A truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case , tears are brought to the eyes . The concept is nothing less then terrifying , and afterwards you are left haunted , but also inspired .  
  I 've just watched Roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be . Toby Malone 's performance really stood out , I found myself actually caring about what happens to Matt throughout the whole of the film , which itself is a lot of fun , very pacey with a good mix of well rounded characters , quite an achievement considering it 's short running time . There are plenty of good twists throughout as well , it will keep you guessing until the end . Other characters to watch out for are the totally insane Tiny and the sneaky attractive Jesse . It may not have the huge budget of a Hollywood blockbuster but don't let that put you off , you could do a lot worse than checking this out , you won't regret it . Good Fun . 7/10  
  It is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages-to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful , colorful production , and , to adults , for a literate script , fine production values , good casting / acting , all bound together with a fine Rozsa score . Two roughly contemporary films accomplish this - " Thief of Baghdad " ( 1940 ) and " The Adventures of Robin Hood " ( 1938 ) . Some of the back story on this production is fascinating . This production , commenced in England in the summer of 1939 , moved to Hollywood , and proved a cover for British intelligence efforts ! The producer , Alexander Korda , was subsequently knighted in 1942 . Here is a unique case of the intersection of art , commerce , and politics ! By all means , secure a good CD of this film for your library !  
  when i read other comment , i decided to watch this movie .. First , cast specially Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli ; good enough .. Film , very intelligence and interesting because , cast have a lot of international specially European actor and actress like from Turkey and Russia .. Second , Story is basic and you can guess but if you interesting action good play you 'll like in my opinion .. Third , Final chapter is not special or interesting , it 's regular like other action movies .. Finally , i recommend to watch this movie .. And i hope You 'll love it enjoy : D  
  Outstanding film of 1943 with Paul Lukas giving an Oscar calibrated performance as the head of his family bringing them back to America from Europe as the Nazi menace deepened . The usual terrific Bette Davis maintains her reputation here and for a change was not nominated for best actress for this or any film of 1943 . Encounting treachery around them , Lukas successfully deals with the situation . He knows he must return to Europe on a clandestine mission and return he does . Davis again pulls out all the stops with a Katharine Hepburn-like shedding of tears when they must part . Resolute , she knows that her older son , must follow him on his path to liberty . A wonderful film highlighting American positive propaganda against a wicked foe .  
  The Thief of Bagdad is a treasure . First and foremost , it is a good story . Though my four children 's primary exposure to this tale , the most famous of the stories of the Arabian Nights , comes from the Disney Corporation , the Thief of Bagdad held their interest to the end . The story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability . Sabu , who plays the young thief , Abu , also measures up to any of today 's teen actors in appeal , judging from the number of times I heard my oldest daughter say , " He 's c u t e ! " In 1940 , the film won Oscars for cinematography and special effects . Today , of course , those effects seem very dated ( " Look , it 's Barbie flying through the air , " declared my daughter at the sight of the genie flying ) . Yet they fit into the story well . The film is , after all , over 60 years old . The effects fit with the script . Furthermore , what ones sees in The Thief of Bagdad remained pretty much state of the art for the next twenty-five years . One need only compare the opening montage from a 1967 Star Trek episode to see this . In that , it was quite an achievement . This qualifies as a family film , though there are a few stabbings near the end . The acting is so obvious and the wounds so bloodless as to those scenes nearly as artificial as animation . All in all , a fun film worth watching for either an evening of pure entertainment , or for the historical value of the effects . I recommend it .  
  I like it because of my recent personal experience . Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite . The characters in the firm did not really enjoy their " real " lives , but they did enjoy themselves , i . e . what they were . The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory . A good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city , but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life . Many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those . Before Sunrise dealt with it in a nice way , which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film . Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head . It just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities . This made the conversations between the characters interesting , not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas . You would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story . The end was not quite important after all . You could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie . Movies are supposed to be enjoyable . This is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it . I am on a journey too . The movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions .  
  I bought the DVD of Before Sunset and saw it for the first time a week ago . Having saw it twice , I couldn't help but missing Before Sunrise , not because the sequel was not as great , but I felt that these two movies completed each other like no other sequels ever did , every time I finished watching one of them , I feel the need and yearning to see the other . So , I ended up spending the weeks watching both of them repeatedly , I will be quite embarrassed to mention how many times exactly . The most remarkable thing about Before Sunrise is how you feel the development of the feelings of their characters towards each other . It sounds so simple , the growing of the chemistry , I think other romantic films might think that they succeed to track the development , but to me - who doesn't believe in Nora Ephron - Before Sunrise is the first film to really gives the viewers chance to feel it . When I saw it for the first time , about 8 year ago when I was 20 , I already liked it . But , I didn't rate it as a " great film " , it still seemed to me like another thinking persons ' feel good movie , Linklater was too smart to make it more realistic , it was 10 minutes too long , the characters was too well fabricated , I thought I liked it because it was like a dream and because I enjoyed their conversations , etc . etc .. But now , thanks to Before Sunset , I feel that 's more to Before Sunrise than what I felt for it before . I saw the elements more clearly : Jesse , Celine , Vienna , their conversations , everything . How each of them are separated element by itself , and they have a chance to mix , the story is just a frame of time , I am no longer feel manipulated . And the freedom that every scene has , as well as its refusal to be overly efficient , how blind I was that those qualities didn't strike me as exceptional when I first saw it ! Now , 8 year have passed , the more movies I 've seen , the more I realize that many movies are just collections of ordered scenes that only exist for the sake of its ending , even movies like Pulp Fiction or Linklaters 's own Slackers included . The Jesse and Celine tale avoid that , maybe Before Sunset is a better example in this case , but Before Sunrise is also one of few films that its ending is just a consequence of time , not a destination , every single scene has its own life . I don't know whether Linklater or anyone else had a sequel in mind when they made Before Sunrise , but to me , one of the most amazing things about these sequels are how these two films visually contrast each other . Before Sunrise which I think employs more static angels and brighter color schemes , seems to try to capture the smallest atoms of liveliness surrounding Jesse and Celine , the world is always full of hope whether or not the characters feel it . Meanwhile , I enter the vision of boredom as Jesse stuck talking to the journalists in Before Sunset , and Celine 's first smile from behind the shelves are the most heartbreaking smile I 've seen in a beginning of a film , and the many moving shots after that takes me to a place I don't know with a sadness in me , no matter how beautiful Paris is , and no matter how happy I am that they meet again . I 'm sorry that I go on this long with my limited English , Before Sunrise is already an extraordinary film without me pouring my scattered thoughts , and it gets even better with an equally great sequel following it .  
  the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people . presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart . a rare combination where the sequel surpasses the prequel in both storytelling and intensity of emotions . the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation . the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed . Ethan and Julie have essayed eternal characters with such simplicity that gives the movie a sheer joy and love to watch . A must see movie for all the people who believe in true love . by far the most romantic ( at least one of them ) movie of all times .  
  This has to be one of the most sincere and touching boy-meets-girl movies ever made . While " Rebel Without a Cause " and " Say Anything " deliver nice portrayals , this movies strips down useless subplots and Hollywood divergences . This movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance . You never doubt for a second that the film will lead towards the romantic pairing of these two people . You almost immediately sense the synergy and the chemistry between Jesse and Celine , and it is simply pure joy to watch them find it . This movie is mostly all dialogue - based . But , every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing . What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is . How in all that conversation , while often having no real bearing on anything critical , you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other . This is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone . And what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe . This could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random . And what puts the icing on this film is the magnificent backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place . It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests . And no matter how many times I watch this film , I don't think I will ever tire of that .  
  Yes , that 's right , it is . I firmly believe that the N64 and the weird looking controller were both designed just so this game could be made . It was amazing the first time I saw it , with its huge environments and colorful characters , and its amazing now . The play control is perfect , the graphics are beautiful , and it has that Nintendo charm that is always so intangible but undeniably there . A must have for any N64 owner , and a reason to get an N64 for everyone else .  
  Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel . I have not read the book so I really didn't know that much about the plot , and yet I still predicted nearly the entire plot . There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing . The film is though for some reason very entertaining and I loved it . Of course there were all the scenes I disliked but the majority was well acted and funny . Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in Emma . The film also stars Toni Collette ( Who has okay but has been much better ) Ewan Mecgreger ( Who has also been better but he is still very good here ) Alan Cumming ( Who I have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here ) and Jeremy Northam ( Who 's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle , even if that was not what it needed ) There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching .  
  Wrapped in gorgeous English country backgrounds , Emma is a delicious confection to be relished for dreamy getaways . Emma ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) is a graceful , intelligent young woman who has just married off her governess-and confidant-to a marriage which Emma takes the credit in matchmaking . Eager to use her talent in arranging things for the people around her , she decides to match the vicar , Mr . Elton ( Alan Cummings ) with her pretty young friend , Harriet ( Toni Collette ) . The result is a series of mixed signals and mistaken interpretations that end up sorting themselves out , with Emma learning that she did not have as much control over events as she thought . The film is full of Jane Austen 's witty and wry characterizations . Gwyneth Paltrow is at her best , portraying this maiden of a restrained , polite society with wit and ease . Her growing romance with the unparalleled Mr . Knightley ( Jeremy Northam ) is the heart of this film . Mr . Knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films . He is incredibly handsome , in a modest , relaxed way that is irresistible . He is certainly well-matched to Gwyneth Paltrow . Their charming friendship that began when he was 16 and she was an infant , has blossomed as he , a family friend , matches wits with her in an older brotherly fashion that grows into something more . With a wry look or understated jab at Emma , Northam 's Knightley is a delight to watch . Other wonderful characterizations include the comic Juliet Stevenson , Greta Scacchi , Ewan McGregor , Polly Walker , and the talkative spinster , Miss Bates , who is very funny . Seeming shorter and more flowing than most Jane Austin adaptations , Emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment .  
  I have no idea how a Texan ( the director , Douglas McGrath ) and the American actress Gwyneth Paltrow ever pulled this off but seeing this again will remind you what all the fuss about Ms . Paltrow was in the first place ! I had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her Oscar-winning " Shakespeare In Love " performance but she gets all the beats right here-she is nigh on perfect as Emma Woodhouse . She may have won her Oscar for Shakespeare but she should be remembered for this . Of course , she 's surrounded by a great supporting cast including Toni Collette , Greta Scacchi , Juliette Stevenson et al .. Jeremy Northam is very appealing as the love interest , even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to Paltrow ( in the process , allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship ) ; several years on , Ewan 's hair is a little easier to take than it was in ' 96 and , personally , I find puckish Alan Cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays . But the standout is , without a doubt , Sophie Thompson ( sister of Emma Thompson , daughter of Phyllida Law ) as Miss Bates ; what this version needs is a scene where Emma reconciles with Miss Bates , as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn . The film is worth watching ( again even ) for her performance alone . All in all , this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the British class system . Well worth a rental ( because its unlikely that Paltrow will ever be this good again-but we 'll always have Emma ) .  
  Jimmy Cagney races by your eyes constantly in this story of a stage-producer who is vigorously struggling against the upcoming " talking " movies . This story of love , deceit , women and dancing is presented in such a manner that as a viewer you are never treated to a dull moment . The direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done . The story never really got lost in this frantic pace . Some parts of the material presented here have become a little dated but that doesn't matter because when you look at this in a 1933 time-frame it is fabulous to watch this next to a lot of the other drags of movies that were released during that time . Jimmy Cagney is a sight for sore eyes in this film , never loosing his composure as the ever-working producer of previews made for the movie theaters as intros . In this way he tries to save his ass from going out of business , he was a broadway producer before he started this . Joan Blondell is fabulous as the neglected love-interest , Nan , she gives such a spirited performance that is so unusual for movies of that time , so cool to watch a woman who is portrayed as a strong woman for a change . The only problem I had with the film were the enormous productions at the end . These were magnificent in itself , beautifully choreographed and wonderfully produced , but they just didn't seem to fit in the story . The only link they have to the main story is that Cagney had to put on 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and that 's what he did . I had a hard time believing that this was what the girls had been rehearsing during the entire movie and that these sets could fit in a movie theater . In this way the " Sitting On A Backyard Fence " was much more appropriate to the story . The productions at the end seemed to drag this frantically paced story to a halt and that was not a good thing . I was tired after seeing the first Musical sequence and then I realized there were another two coming up . These sequences got a lot a chuckles from the audience as well . All in all a great film with a sour ending . 9/10  
  Starting off , here 's a synopsis : Porno queen Alta Lee ( Lynn Lowry ) is murdered by her pornographer lover Max ( George Shannon ) in a game of sexual Russian roulette . Alta 's other lover , icy lesbian casting agent Camila Stone ( Mary Woronov ) , provides an alibi for Max . But Camila has an agenda of her own , and a plan involving the seduction of innocent actress Julie ( Lynn again ) in a web of sexual mind games . When the lookalikes ' identities are sufficiently blurred , the stage is set for vengeance as passionate as the most heated carnal encounter . Though this movie is quite obscure and never got much attention , I find it to be a sexy , suspenseful gem . Cult goddess Woronov has one of her best-ever roles , and she and sexy-innocent Lowry play off each other well . The unsettling music provided by Gershon Kingsley , plus two original songs ( " All-American Boy , " " You Say You 've Never Let Me Down " ) and the Jaynetts ' " Sally , Go ' Round the Roses " compose a memorable soundtrack . Theodore Gershuny 's direction is sharp , with everything photographed in muted earth tones that perfectly suggest unsavory business bubbling under society 's upper crust . With tons of great New York atmosphere , Ondine ( Woronov 's friend and fellow Warholite ) giving a great performance in a small role , and exotic Monique Van Vooren as Max 's ex-wife in a comic sub-plot . This sub-plot , though amusing , looks like it belongs in another movie altogether . However , I 'm not complaining , as the film is smooth even as it changes gears and is a hell of a lot more interesting that the erotic-thriller garbage currently being cranked out . Trivia : Sugar Cookies was originally rated X ( soft-core ) and released by General Film Corporation in 1973 . I am the proud owner of an original one-sheet poster-lucky me ! In 1977 , the movie was cut for an R and re-released by Troma Team , which now offers it uncut on videotape . Mary Woronov was the wife of Theodore Gershuny at the time , and was reportedly uncomfortable performing the graphic lesbian simulated sex scenes with him leering behind the camera . She can also be seen in two of his earlier productions , Kemek ( 1970 ) and Silent Night , Bloody Night ( 1972 ) .  
  What a great Barbara Stanwyck film that I happened to see the other night . " Jeopardy " was fantastic . It was made in 1953 and probably for double bills but it kept me on the edge of my seat . Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen , who with husband Doug ( Barry Sullivan ) and son ( Lee Aaker ) drive to an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a vacation . Husband has a fall from the jetty and the only way he is to be saved is if Barbara drives back to a garage for some rope . While there she runs into a psychotic killer ( Ralph Meeker - one of my favourites ) and what follows is a game of cat and mouse as Barbara tries everything in her power to get Meeker to come back with her to free her husband . The film was so suspenseful and such a surprise - I was not expecting such a great film . But I suppose I should have realized - is there anything Barbara Stanwyck does that is anything less than wonderful ?  
  This is a great little film , that 's very unique , and creative , with some great plot twists and wonderful performances ! . All the characters are great , and the story while bizarre , is fascinating and very interesting , plus Nicole Kidman is simply amazing in this ! . It 's very hard to describe this movie , because it really is quite bizarre , it 's a comedy / romance , one minute then it turns into a thriller the next , however it was still very entertaining all the same , plus Nicole 's Russian accent was fantastic , and extremely convincing . Chaplin and Kidman had very good chemistry together , and i loved Vincent Cassel 's performance ! , plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise ! . The ending was very cute , and it 's unpredictable throughout ! , plus this movie is quite underrated as well ! . You will feel sorry for Chaplin and the way that he is scammed , and i thought all the characters were really likable , plus the finale is especially good . This is Nicole 's movie though , and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance ! . This is a great little film , that 's very unique , and creative , with some great plot twists and wonderful performances ! , i highly recommend this one ! . The Direction is very good ! . Jez Butterworth does a very good job here , with great camera work , solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace ! . The Acting is wonderful ! . Nicole Kidman , is stunningly gorgeous ! , and is amazing as always , she is incredibly sexy , very likable , had one of the coolest accents , added a lot of presence , had very good chemistry with Ben Chaplin , and had a very mysterious character ! , she was amazing . ( Kidman Rules ! ) . Ben Chaplin is great here , he is extremely likable , had a cool character , had very good chemistry with Kidman , the only thing i didn't like was him taking out his anger out on Kidman , even though what she did was wrong , and i loved how he got revenge in the end ! . Vincent Cassel is fantastic as the main villain , yes he was OTT , but he was very intense and quite creepy at times , this role was perfect for him . Mathieu Kassovitz is OK here , but didn't have much to do . Rest of the cast are fine . Overall i highly recommend this one ! . * 1/2 out of 5  
  For a film that got little publicity , and few people have heard about , this was pretty good . It 's another one of these modern-day British crime films that are quirky ( " Snatch , " " Sexy Beast , " etc . ) . It 's not wild like " Snatch " but it 's interesting and it has some rough characters . It also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show - not late - has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first-time viewer . Basically , it 's about a low-key British male who sends away for a Russian " mail order bride " who winds up , with the aid of two Russian male friends , providing a couple of big surprises . Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star , and are very good as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman 's Russian cohorts . This is a different kind of film and well-acted . Kidman once again proves she 's far more than just a beautiful face .  
  Jessica Alba 's Max and Valerie Rae Miller 's Original Cindy shines in this actionpacked and atmospheric serial . Wonderfully politically incorrect . Quality varies greatly from episode to episode , but generally the standard is high and when it is not , Jessica is always worth looking at . Valerie 's urban jivetalking afroamerican is occationally almost dragging Dark Angel into sitcom territory .  
  This is one of those feel good , Saturday afternoon movies . It 's right up there with other retro flicks like Flight of the Navigator . Just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up . And it 's fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson . Not to mention Joquin Phoenix . I personally really like movies like this from time to time . Nothing too deep or too scary . Just a nice story line . And I would have never known Mr . Phoenix had I not recently read the credits . He was just a baby really when he made this movie . Kelly Preston was quite the young budding actress then too . She and Lea did a wonderful job in this movie . I agree it 's not an Oscar caliber movie . But very much worth watching . Especially if you have kids in the , let 's say , 8 to 11 year old range . Or ones that are interested in the space program .  
  To sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible . Every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid-fire images , through to the last shot of the clean up at Ground Zero , but every frame is real . The story was thought up by two French brothers living in New York . Jules ( 28 ) and Gideon ( 31 ) Naudet ( pronounced " Nau-day " ) want to make a documentary on New York City Firefighters , beginning with a " newbie " from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full-fledged firefighter . Seeking the help of their close friend , actor James Hanlon ( 36 ) , an actor and firefighter at Station 1 , Engine 7 , the Naudets sift through the " Probies " at the academy and find one , Tony Benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on . Tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close-knit family . Firefighters have a superstition about " Probies . " It is that they are either " White Clouds " or " Black Clouds , " meaning that with the latter , all kinds of fires follow the " Probie . " The former means that very little fire activity follows , but one day , there will be the mother of all fires . Tony is a " White Cloud . " After some initial growing pains , Tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet . Then the unthinkable occurs .. September 11 , 2001 begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from Wall Street . Because Jules has had little camera experience , Gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief , T . K . Pfeiffer . Arriving at about 8:42 , the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate . Then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene , and as Jules pans upwards , we see the first strike of the day . American Airlines Flight 11 smashes into the face of the North Tower of 1 World Trade . Pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the World Trade Center . Once there , Jules asks to accompany the Chief into the tower . Pfeiffer tells Naudet to stick close to him . Once inside , the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives . Gideon Naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area . Once there , he captures the impact of the second plane , United Airlines Flight 175 , with 2 World Trade . He knows Jules is with Chief Pfeiffer inside the towers . Watching and capturing the crowds ' reaction to the unimaginable , Gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in Lower Manhattan . Inside tower one , Jules records the last view the world , or loved ones will have of their sons , fathers , uncles , grandfathers , husbands , boyfriends , friends as one by one , each firefighter , carrying 60 lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped . Jules also catches the last glimpse Chief Pfeiffer will have of his brother , Kevin , as he leaves to do his selfless duty . Also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones , sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke . But Jules is respectful , never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment .. the money shot . His work is professional through his baptism of fire . He also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building . Then Jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken : Father Michael Judd , the Chaplain for the fire department . Then as Jules and Chief Pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two , tower one begins its structural collapse . What results is a breathtakingly , poignant view from inside Ground Zero as Jules and Gideon work separately to document that day . Not knowing if either is alive , each fearing the worst . As each firefighter arrives at the firehouse , they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back . And in one moment of overwhelming emotion , Jules and Gideon are reunited . As Jules cries on his brother 's shoulder , Gideon embraces his younger brother as Hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject . There is one fearful moment when Tony Benetakos , who left the station with a former chief , is believed to have been lost .. but returns to the fold , this " Probie " has proven himself . Shown with only three interruptions , 9/11 is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking . It ranks up there with the Hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds . The Naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject . In lesser hands , the tendency would be toward the sensational , but the Naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion . Narrated by Hanlon , we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of September 11 . Robert De Niro hosts the program in a sombre , restrained way . He never seeks the camera for his own glory , rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see . I also commend CBS for their bravery at airing this special . Chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings , they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished . This is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is . It isn't about dribbling a basketball , or selling an album of hate lyrics .. 9/11 is about humanity at its best . Heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom .  
  I enjoyed this movie . Haven't seen Andy Griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly . I 've associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he 's versatile . I wasn't troubled that Dotty 's " anxiety disorder " may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook . There are zillions of whatever-phobias and neuroses , and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms . She is clearly a sensitive with extra-sensory powers as was understood by the local Indians but not by any Anglos . It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric . Although this is taken to be a light " family movie " , it is actually more sophisticated than it seems . Also , Hiram 's twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle . It 's fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance .  
  Lars Von Triers Europa is an extremely good film . How 's that ? Von Trier has a very stylized way to tell a story , at least he did have with Europa . To me the whole film was like an experience even if I did see it on a small television screen . Even with all the tricks , in my opinion , this film is the most complete , REAL and moving piece of cinema then most of the films on the top 250 list . I also think it is perhaps the scariest , the most gothic and complete film around . All right there are other good ones too , but this one is my favorite . The final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever .  
  I have just seen this film , and fallen in love with it . There is a little bit of something for everyone , and its a particular free for all when it comes to the romance between Lachlan and Lil . When they are on the beach , I nearly cried .. there is the unspoken realization that time is the most precious commodity and it is most evident when they are together . This idea taken from several angles , from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional of places . The film almost makes you long for that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow could very well be your last . Crowe was particularly wonderful in his role of Lachlan . I 've always had a soft spot for the accent , but I nearly melted with his portrayal of his character . The way this film was shot is also beautiful , with the music , backdrop of the open fields , and superb acting . All together , this is a wonderful film that tugs at all of human emotions .  
  An excellent cast makes this movie work ; all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and it 's clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie . It 's not quite the comedy I expected , much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor . For music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funny . I hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies , but so much of this movie reminded me of Alan Parker films I can't help it : imagine if The Commitments actually did make it big - and then tried to recapture said glory 25 years later .  
  In the voice over which begins the film , Hughie ( Billy Connolly ) , a roadie for the great 70 's band Strange Fruit , said the reason lightning struck at a rock festival to stop Strange Fruit 's set was that God was sick of 70 's excess . Indeed , it 's been popular to put down that era of music , and see punk as a welcome antidote to it . While I agree the excess was tiresome ( as well as the misogynistic urges which came out of it ) , and like punk , I still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock , and this film about Strange Fruit 's long , strange reunion is an affectionate tribute to those days . One of the reasons the film works is the care of the people behind the scenes . Brian Gibson directed WHAT 'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT , about Tina Turner ( while I had problems with the dramatic parts of the film , the music was handled very well ) , writers Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais co-wrote THE COMMITMENTS and were behind the music-oriented British TV show OVER THE RAINBOW , and the songs Strange Fruit played were co-written by Foreigner 's Mick Jones ( not to be confused with The Clash 's Mick Jones ) , so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about . Also , two cast members are musicians in their own right ( Bill Nye I don't know about , though the film credits him with his own singing , and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era , while Jimmy Nail was in another British TV show which was music-oriented , though I forget the name , and he was in EVITA ) , and the others are convincing at it . And while , as I said , a lot of 70 's bands like Strange Fruit behaved badly towards women , the movie doesn't make the same mistake ( except for the woman who follows Timothy Spall around ) ; as the manager of the reunion , Juliet Aubrey is quite good and plays a fully rounded character . The other actors are all good as well , with special praise to Stephen Rea , who handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality . There are a couple of plot points which don't work , but overall this is quite enjoyable . Oh yeah , and the music is good too .  
  What happens to washed up rock-n-roll stars in the late 1990 's ? They launch a comeback / reunion tour . At least , that 's what the members of Strange Fruit , a ( fictional ) 70 's stadium rock group do . Tony ( Stephen Rea ) has the concession on condom vending machines when he runs into the son of the promoter of a famous music festival . It was at that festival in the 70 's that Strange Fruit broke up . The 70 's are " retro " and the time is right to wide that wave . He sets off in search of the other members of the band . Part of what broke up the band was the death and replacement of Keith , the lead singer and brilliant song writer . The band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back amongst the working class from which they came . Beano , the drummer , played by Timothy Spall ( who was brilliant in Secrets and Lies ) is a layabout , the bass player is a roofer , and their lead singer is still a rocker . While he owns a huge mansion he has been forced to sell it , as his fortune has not lasted . Brian , the lead guitarist , is dead , so a young guitarist is hired to replace him . Somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try . Abandoning their day jobs , they begin to rehearse , and their manager approaches their label about reissuing their albums . But he wants them to start touring again first . And so they hit the club circuit around Europe . The club scene is not kind to these overweight , dated , old rockers . It is on tour that the film really starts to develop . All of the old conflicts rearise , with the figures of Keith and Brian hovering throughout . They all hang together because they are all in search of a second chance for the greatness that eluded them earlier . And they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable . Still Crazy starts as Spinal Tap II but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film , following the relationships of the band members . While it is still a very funny movie , it is the evolving characters , struggling to deal with the deaths of Brian and Keith and with their own personal demons , that make the film work .  
  I always thought this would be a long and boring Talking-Heads flick full of static interior takes , dude , I was wrong . " Election " is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller-drama , taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of Triads-Rituals . Characters are constantly on the move , and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider , it 's still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters . Furthermore Johnnie To succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light-shadow contrasts . Although there 's hardly any action , the ending is still shocking in it 's ruthless depicting of brutality . Cool movie that deserves more attention , and I came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit .  
  Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams . It all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations , both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget . There are many great laughs ( even if the story is somewhat thin ) sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s Hollywood comedy style . A definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses , which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience . As he makes his exit , he assures the client ( Grant ) that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of $ 100.00 from the total .. or at least $ 50.00 .. but certainly $ 25.00 . Hilarious !  
  Who can watch a movie , look at Lucy Liu and not be overjoyed . That woman is amazingly beautiful & a talented actress . That 's a tough combination to find now a days . And Jeremy Northam . i heard his name plenty of times , but i never really noticed him . My advice to Hollywood is : " use him more " . now about the movie : I watched it in one of my graveyard shift . I don't recommend that to anyone . It 's a bit to complicated & mysterious for that . i still can't believe i didn't see the ending coming . I 'm not gonna say what cause that 'll spoil the hole movie . although saying this is spoilment enough . now i 'm suppose to cast my vote about this movie . I love the dark mystic story , the actors did a good job & i love the directors ( natali ) work in the past . There 's not a big audience for this kind of thing , that 's also pretty risky . you know what , i 'm just gonna give this work a 8 cause everybody should see this . Then again , 1 point deduction cause there is always space for improvement .  
  Canadian director Vincenzo Natali took the art-house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent Cube , which is my personal favourite SF film of the 90s . It framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube , shot entirely on one set , and took this idea in fascinating directions . I 've been eagerly awaiting Natali 's follow-up , and although its taken five years for him to mount another project , I 'm delighted to say it was worth the wait . Cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man 's place in the world , and how through a completely logical chain of events , finds himself in a situation beyond his control . I don't want to reveal too much about the plot , because one of the joys of Cypher is the different avenues it takes us down . It is so refreshing in this day and age to see a SF film that has more than one idea in it 's head . Cypher is such a film . Morgan Sullivan ( Jeremy Northam ) , one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet , is hired by the company DigiCorp . They send him to different parts of America to record different seminars . To his bewilderment , they are unbelievably boring . Covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese . While Morgan is waiting for one seminar , he runs into Rita Foster ( an impeccably cast Lucy Liu ) , the definition of an ice maiden . She gives him the brush-off , but there is something to her he finds irresistible . That 's not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in . When Rita turns up at another one of Morgan 's seminars , she tells him his life is not what it appears . And I 'm not saying anything more about the plot . To do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us , as well as the tortuous path that 's so much fun to follow . As with Cube , Natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people , taking them out of the familiar , and basically seeing what will happen when they 're thrust into the unknown . And Cypher follows similar patterns . But it 's not a carbon copy of Cube . It has it 's own inspiration . Cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories . One of the great things about Cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge . When Morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle , it 's as much of a shock to us as it is to him . One thing that distinguishes Cypher from Cube is how much more polished it is . Where Cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns , Cypher is also on a low budget , but Natali economises it as much as he can , allowing him to broaden the horizon , and launching Morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity . Natali 's direction is exceptional , with a deft hand on the reins . There are some amazing camera angles from above , such as the enormity of the DigiCorp building as a vast , robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is Morgan standing outside . All the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture , which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film-noir . The acting is uniformly excellent throughout . Jeremy Northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity . His performance is excellent because it 's so modulated . He literally seems to transform right before our very eyes . From a clinical , spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity . David Hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in Cube . He resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from Men in Black . His scene is one of the best because it 's an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia . He is a supposed expert in identifying double-agents , and it 's a fantastic piece of writing , brilliantly acted by Hewlett . All he has to do is look at Morgan , and we 're drawn into his complex mind game . But it 's Lucy Liu who 's the scene stealer here . Too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect . But in Cypher , she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove . Rita is an aloof , guarded femme fatale that Liu inhabits with relish . I perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control , and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone . Things come to a very gratifying end , that doesn't conclude on an ambiguous note the way Cube did . But Morgan deserves his happy ending . After he 's been put through the ringer like this , I cheered for him in the final scene . It 's a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes . Cypher succeeds on all counts . Engaging , shocking , always entertaining , it 's everything that Total Recall wanted to be but wasn't . And it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable Matrix . A fine follow-up from Natali . And now I 'm a committed fan of the man . Superb stuff !  
  - Having grown tired of the rat race and cramped living conditions of New York City , Jim Blandings ( Cary Grant ) finds a property in the country for his wife and children . He 's hoping to find the simple life . But , building a house proves to be anything but simple . As the headaches and the bills start piling up , so do the laughs . Will Mr . Blanding 's ever get his dream house ? - What makes this movie so special is the three main actors - Grant , Myrna Loy , and Melvyn Douglas . Any of three are capable of carrying a movie on their own , so when you combine their talents , almost every scene is special . Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role . He is so good at playing the put upon husband . Loy is a always a joy to watch . The Thin Man films she made with William Powell are near perfect . And Douglas has become a favorite of mine over the last two or three years . Douglas also appeared in The Old Dark House , a particular favorite of mine . - The movie is definitely a product of its time . I get a kick out of imagining a time when you could build a two-story , three bedroom , four bathroom house on $ 15,000 income a year . Throw in the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a live-in maid and it becomes almost fanciful . - However , for anyone who has bought or built a house , many of the situations and predicaments the Blanding 's find themselves in are easily relatable to today . And that 's where the comedy comes in . How many people have done some of the stupid things the couple does in this movie only to end up costing more money than expected ? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr . Blandings is the whole " wife in love with best friend " subplot . It 's really not necessary to the plot and feels out-of-place and very uncomfortable as presented .  
  Four prisoners share a single cell : the domineering transvestite , Marcus ( Clovis Cornillac ) ; Marcus 's idiot savant buddy , Paquerette ( Dimitri Rataud ) , who will eat anything in sight including pocket watches , cockroaches , and his little sister ; Lassalle ( Philippe Laudenbach ) , the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife ; and Carrère ( Gérald Laroche ) , the new guy who was caught up in corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping . After a brick falls from the wall of the cell , the men discover the hidden journal written by a ' Fountain of Youth'-obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s . Is this journal the secret to their escape ? Or is there something much more sinister behind it ? I was a little weary about getting into this film because the only other experience I have with Eric Valette was the dreadful One Missed Call ( 2008 ) , which I consider to be the worst theatrically released film I 've ever seen . However , much of what was wrong with One Missed Call could probably be attributed to Klavan 's awful script , because ( as I remember ) Valette 's direction wasn't the worst part about the film ( unless he chose to include the baby ) . Anyway , Maléfique was a good way to get my respect back . . . it 's a French film ( obviously something I like ) and it takes place in prison ( which is my second favourite horror setting after asylums ) . So that 's two points for him before the film even starts . Luckily , Valette had me once the film ended as well . Maléfique is a rather deep , rather complex , rather compelling story of obsession and desperation . . . the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality . While it 's not a terrifying film in the traditional sense , the oddity of its power makes it pretty damn frightening . The period between the climax and conclusion was some of the best film I 've seen in quite some time and I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool gore . Final verdict : 8.5/10 . Quite a bit of respect earned back by Valette . Note : Paramount picked up the rights to make an American remake ( surprise surprise ) . It 's due out in 2009 . I 'm not sure why , to be honest , as this doesn't seem like something that would be a big moneymaker here in the states . But , I 've been surprised before . Vive La France ! -AP3-  
  Jon Voight plays a man named Joe . Joe is shook up by a haunting childhood . He has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic baptism . He quits his job as a dishwasher and goes out to become a hustler for wealthy people . He meets a misfit named Ratso ( Dustin Hoffman ) and the two for a relationship . They go out and work together in helping each other out . They become thieves . The two grow remarkably close and soon can't live without each other . However , there is something very important that Ratso hasn't told Joe , and it could destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together . This is one of the greatest films ever made . It is a heartbreaking and shattering portrait of too very lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other . Their story is devastating to watch , but is ultimately important for people to see . It 's one of those films where the characters are pretty much just like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street . The difference is that this film is from their perspective . Their lives are shown to us and it 's devastating to see the pedestrians in this film treat them like dirt , especially if we at one time were one of those people . However , the film doesn't try to guilt trip you . Instead , it shows you the rough side of the lifestyle of hustling . It is not a pleasant and easygoing lifestyle like many Hollywood films portray it such as MILK MONEY and PRETTY WOMAN . The lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty , gritty , and ugly life and it 's sad that people have degraded themselves like the character of Joe in this film does . What startles me the most about this film was that it came out in 1969 , and it has stood the test of time perfectly . Today 's audiences will still find great meaning in this film and will still love it and cherish it just as much as critics and audiences did everywhere in 1969 . The film was rated X , but what I notice about this film is that the sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest , realistic , and effective way . Anybody who has had sex before will know how humorous , awkward , and scary as hell it can be and this film doesn't shy away from any of that . The sex in this film may not be as graphic as in once was thought to be . Movies that were X rated such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY , A CLOCKWORK ORANGE , GREETINGS , LAST TANGO IN Paris , and FRITZ THE CAT all seem remarkably tame compared to the shocking things that people can get away with an R rating today . The sex scenes in MIDNIGHT COWBOY will seem quite strong but they certainly aren't sexy . They are not graphic , but they are realistic , and that 's what people should keep in mind when they view this film . The course language that is used in the film , particularly the word " fag " is used effectively and is not gratuitous . The violence is very shocking to watch even today , but again it is necessary to the plot to depict the world of a hustler . I 'm really glad to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not dated and is still just as affecting as it was in 1969 , if not more . I can't recommend this classic enough and I do hope that it continues to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten . PROS : - Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both harrowing and amazing to watch . They have never played roles like this before or since and they are completely different from usual . You 'll forget who is playing them within minutes ! - Beautiful score - Not at all dated or campy like many films of that decade come off as today - Fantastic and fast editing job CONS : - For mature audiences only - The opening scenes are well done , but they could be just a little stronger .  
  " Midnight Cowboy " was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic . You know it 's a classic the moment its insistent theme song , ' Everybody 's Talking ' starts up on the soundtrack , ( actually not written for the film ) , and the way the camera introduces us to Joe Buck , ( naked and in the shower ) . We had seen Jon Voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he 's ' one helluva stud ' who 's to doubt him ? This was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if Voight had never done anything else , his performance here would still be legendary . As it is Voight has seldom disappointed on screen ; even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish " Anaconda " is a source of pleasure ) . The film became famous and infamous almost overnight . It was a crowd-pleaser , ( even with its downbeat ending ) , funny and sexy and recognizably ' real ' ; ( it was the tail-end of the sixties and all the characters rang true ) . It was also the first ' X ' rated film to win the Oscar as the year 's Best Picture . Adapted , ( brilliantly ) , by Waldo Salt from a James Leo Herlihy novel it was probably the first main-stream commercial American movie to deal with ' taboo ' subjects such as homosexuality and drug-taking in a matter-of-fact manner . Everyone is recognizably human , warts and all , and everyone is treated sympathetically . Voight 's Joe Buck is an innocent abroad , a Candide who comes to New York to seek his fortune as a hustler , ( a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy ; he 's a cross between a gigolo and a social worker ) . But when he himself is hustled by a scraggy , wormy little con-man called ' Ratso ' Rizzo , ( Dustin Hoffman , fresh from " The Graduate " and he 's a revelation ) , he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe-dream . Essentially it 's a male love story , ( though totally platonic ) , between these two not so unlikely bedfellows . Both totally alone , both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other , ( Voight with his physical prowess , Hoffman with his street-wise savvy ) . They are misfits adrift from the mainstream , tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others . Though ' straight ' Voight isn't beyond a homosexual encounter in a 42nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself . ( The whole film posits a strangely ' Christian ' attitude ) . It 's also magnificently acted . While Voight and Hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of Brenda Vaccaro and Sylvia Miles as well as John McGiver , Bob Balaban and Bernard Hughes as sundry customers and hangers-on , beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while John Schlesinger 's direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien 's totally detached eye-view of the American under-belly without rancor and without criticism . On second thoughts , maybe it is a great movie after all .  
  ' One-Round ' Jack Sander is called that because he 's a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience . If they can last one round , they win a prize-a popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago . Jack is in love with the ticket girl , Mabel , though her head is quickly turned when Bob Corby enters the ring to try his chances with Jack . What no one at the fight knows is that Bob is the champ , so he 's able to beat Jack-though it takes him some work . As a result , Bob asks Jack to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit . Later , Jack improves so much that he , too , becomes a legitimate boxer . Slowly , he works his way up the rankings until he 's nearly ready to take on the Champ . In the meantime , the Champ and Mabel start running around behind Jack 's back-even though by now Mabel has married Jack . So , when the final fight occurs between Jack and Bob , it 's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him . Is he good enough ? Will rise justifiable rage against Bob help or hinder his performance ? Tune in and see . This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery-suspense films , back in the 1920s , Hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote ( he did both for this film ) . In fact , in many ways this film is more indicative of Hitchcock 's silent style , as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next silents , THE MANXMAN ( also starring Carl Brisson as the wronged husband ) . So , while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day , it was not a radical departure for this great director-even with its rather formulaic ending . Overall , while a bit predictable and having Ian Hunter playing a boxing champ seems silly , the film works well . While far from a perfect silent , it 's well worth seeing and packs a nice punch .  
  Four teenage girlfriends drive to Fort Laurdale for spring break . Unfortunately they get a flat tire in Medley , Georgia and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder deep in the woods . The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins .. " Shallow Grave " is a pleasant low-budget surprise . The cast is likable enough , the direction is steady and the violence is particularly nasty and misogynistic . Especially the second murder is pretty grim . The murderous sheriff isn't one-dimensional character-in a couple of scenes it seems that he feels remorse for what he 's done . The subplot involving the two boys they meet in the diner goes nowhere , but the stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting . 7 out of 10 .  
  Luchino Visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries . The great directors of Italy of the 40s and 50s were men who understood the medium , but it was Luchino Visconti , a man of vision , who dared to bring a film like to show what he was capable of doing . He clearly shows his genius early on in his distinguished career with " Ossessione " , a film based on James Cain 's " The Postman Always Ring Twice " , which was later made by Hollywood , but that version pales in comparison with what Visconti achieved in the movie . Luchino Visconti and his collaborators on the screen included an uncredited Alberto Moravia , a man who knew about the effect of passion on human beings . The film has been well preserved in the DVD format we watched recently . The film is a must for all serious movie fans because we can see how Visconti 's vision translated the text into a movie that rings true in a plausible way , something the American version lacked . What comes across watching the movie , is the intensity which the director got from his key players . The magnificent Clara Calamai does an amazing job as Giovanna , the woman who has married an older man , but when Gino appears in her life , all she wants to do is rid herself of the kind man who gave her an opportunity in life . Giovanna is one of the best creations in Ms . Calamai 's achievements in the Italian cinema . The last sequence of the film shows Ms . Calamai at her best in the ironic twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed . Equally excellent is Massimo Girotti , one of the best actors of his generation who appears as Gino , the hunky man that awakens the obsessive passion in Giovanna . Gino is the perfect man for Giovanna , something that Mr . Girotti projects with such ease and sophistication not equaled before in the screen . Mr . Girotti makes the man come alive in a performance that seems so easy , yet with another actor it might not have been so apparent . Juan DeLanda is seen as Giuseppe , the older man who fell in love with Giovanna . In fact , his character rings truer than his counterpart in the American film , where he is seen more as a buffoon . The film is beautifully photographed by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti . They gave the film a naturalistic look that was the way Italian directors of the era favored . The original musical score of Giuseppe Rosati is perfect . Visconti , a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors , also includes arias by Bizet and Verdi that fit well in the context of the movie . " Ossessione " is a film to treasure because we see a great Luchino Visconti at the top of his form .  
  The combination of the superb black and white photography and the ' Eugene Onegin with a twist ' plot made this a real knock out for me . The atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasional very bright overexposed white was gripping . There was a superb moment where where transparencies - apparently conventional holiday snaps but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly - were shown accompanied by Lensky 's heart-wrenching aria from the Tschaikowsky opera Eugene Onegin . For me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium , which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere - Last Year in Marienbad is a good example of such a film . Krisana is in the same mould .  
  I dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites . It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli . It won two Academy Awards for Best Picture of 1951 and Best Screenplay . The story of an American painter in Paris who tries to make it big . Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him , but soon finds she loves the guy . Meanwhile Gene Kelly falls for lovely damsel , Leslie Caron . His main dancing partner , and I must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise . Famous French singer Georges Guietary sings , too . So if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with Oscar Levant 's nimble piano fingers , the songs of George Gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem . 8/10  
  I don't watch soaps . My grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass . I made fun of them it when I was ten ( it was so easy ) . But this movie takes parody and spells it a new way . I found the story pretty damn funny . The fashions of the 80 's - shoulder pads , sequins , and polyester - just top it off . The huge hair , the high heels , and the histrionics - what a combination . And all the actors just go to town , chewing up their parts and spitting them out in a big well scripted pile . Sally , Kevin , Elisabeth - wonderful ! Whoopi - great ! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him back when he had such potential , before the tabloids . And Garry : why did we have to wait so long to see him on film ? Leesa Gibbons - hadn't been missing her , but nice to include her as a real life entertainment reporter ( and where do you apply for THAT job , anyway ? ) . Admittedly , I could have done without Sally climbing the drainpipe . Lucy Ricardo did it , how many times ? , as has every comedienne from Carol Burnett to I don't know who and I 'm so done with it now , I could spit peanuts if I had them . Apparently it 's what you do when you 're being funny in a tall building in New York . I 'm just thankful they didn't pull out the flagpole bit . But it was cute , it was funny , it had plot twists , it had an after credits ending before that was common , it had clothes worthy of a second glance , it had a great cast and it 's got personal memories for me . Really , what more do you need ?  
  I admit that for the first 20 minutes or so of this film I wasn't entirely sure I was going to sit through the whole thing . Like many other people , I found it pretty boring , and I wasn't entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them together . However , if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product , you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is . I really think it 's sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists . Rivers and Tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of Andy Goldsworthy , who makes his art entirely out of things in nature , generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy . It is slow moving and unglamorous , but I think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that Goldsworthy 's art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated . I 've even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie , rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves , which I just think is madness . On the other hand , lots of people complain about CDs coming with the lyrics written out inside them . A lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics , I guess I 'm just the kind of person that believes that I 'd like to know what the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork . I can still take it how I want to even if I know what it was meant to do . I can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie . He does , after all , lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion , but if you don't want Goldsworthy talk about his art while you 're watching the film , feel free to turn the sound off . That 's like not reading the lyrics if you don't want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourself . I think that Andy Goldsworthy 's work , which I had no idea existed before I watched this movie , is incredibly impressive , and I 'm glad that this film was made in order to showcase it . Indeed , since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio , photography is the only medium other than film that can express it , and I really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art , and the way that only things from nature are used . Whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented , Goldsworthy 's work is moving enough to overlook that , because the film is not the star , Goldsworthy 's art is . And given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slow-moving nature of the film , it seems to me that director Thomas Riedelsheimer knows that .  
  This is the best movie I 've come across in a long while . Not only is this the best movie of its kind ( school shooting ) The way Ben Coccio ( the director ) decided to film it was magnificent . He filmed it using teenage actors who were still attending high school . He filmed it in the actors own rooms and used the actors real parents as their parents in the film . Also the actors were filming too using camcorders making it seem much more like a video diary . It is almost artful . ( if that is indeed a word ) There are a few slip ups however , for example when Cal calls brads ( ? ) land rover a range rover ( or vice versa , It 's been awhile since I 've seen it )  
  " Kolchak : the Night Stalker " is a hugely entertaining TV series in which a pushy , sarcastic , forty-something reporter is repeatedly drawn into mortal combat with supernatural ( and occasionally extraterrestrial ) forces . Based on a very popular pair of TV movies featuring the Kolchak character , this series died a quick death in the mid-1970s due to low ratings , but it nevertheless maintains a strong cult following today . But will the average modern-day viewer be able to dig Kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead ? That 's actually a tough question to answer fairly . Detractors of this series tend to argue that it 's formulaic and hopelessly dated . On the other hand , fans argue that it 's cleverly written , well-acted , and sometimes genuinely spooky . And me ? I 've got a foot in both camps . I thoroughly enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of Kolchak on DVD recently , though I can plainly see that the series has major flaws . I 'll address the question of Kolchak being " formula " fiction first . Now , I think we can all agree that most TV shows have formulas - just about every episode of Columbo unfolds according to the same pattern , for example . Repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself ; in fact , critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy , and actively seek out , repetitive entertainment . However , the problem with Kolchak is that its formula is simply TOO rigid - it 's too repetitive even by the most generous standards . In almost every episode , Kolchak investigates a murder , and figures out that it was committed by some form of monster . He tries to publish a story about said monster , but his editor Vincenzo blocks him , always on the grounds that Kolchak doesn't have sufficient evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work . And , alas , Kolchak is also obstructed by the police . So , in the end , Kolchak does some independent research on the monster , figures out how to kill it .. and then kills it . Without ceremony , or reward , or writing a big story about it . You can see where this ever-so-strict formula might get tiresome , right ? I 'm particularly mystified by Vincenzo - if Kolchak 's always raving about monsters , and Vincenzo never believes it .. well , then , why doesn't Vincenzo fire Kolchak , or have him committed ? That 's what any normal boss would do . But the series eschews such realism and prefers to keep Vincenzo and Kolchak as comical antagonists . As a result , many of their scenes together are profoundly unbelievable - though they are also quite funny . The very best episodes of Kolchak manage to vault over the limitations of this formula , however , usually because they contain some kind of unexpected twist . These select episodes are good enough that I think they 're largely immune to typical criticisms of the series . Some of my favorites include : Horror in the Heights - an episode that 's noteworthy for being grimy , inventive and socially aware . Kolchak 's dialog has an unusually sharp and cynical edge . Though it adheres closely to the Kolchak formula , the script ( written by Hammer Studios veteran Jimmy Sangster ) is remarkably literate , and it delves deeply into the monster 's backstory . The Devil 's Platform - a possible inspiration for the " Omen " films , this episode stands out to me because the villain - a very young Tom Skerritt - tempts Kolchak with a satanic contract full of goodies ( and , in so doing , reveals a lot about the reporter 's character . ) Firefall - this episode appears to have a bad reputation among fans , but I enjoyed it because it 's got a great red herring and a really creepy , almost unstoppable-seeming monster . Though I 've singled out these three episodes for praise , I 'd say that most of the stories are entertaining at the very least . For my money , there are only two complete turkeys in the 20-episode run : Primal Scream , which is about monkey-men running rampant in Chicago , and the Sentry , which features the dumbest-looking creature makeup in the history of filmed entertainment ( and this assessment is coming from a lifelong Doctor Who and Godzilla fan ! ) On balance , then , this is a good series . A little repetitive , a little cheesy perhaps , but it has elements of greatness . Even during the weaker episodes , Darren McGavin 's wonderful performance as the caustic , world-weary , endlessly funny Kolchak truly shines . He carries the series effortlessly , in a way that , for example , Sarah Michelle Gellar never managed on " Buffy . " McGavin was one great character actor , and this series is worth watching for him alone .  
  One of my favorite shows back in the ' 70s . As I recall it went to air on Friday ( or possibly Saturday ) night on the Nine Network ( ? ) here in Australia . Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together . Each episode usually reached a climax with Kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent . To their credit , the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible . I remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient Indian Chief which / who ' came back ' as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital . The final showdown saw Kolchack trying to short circuit the ' power beast ' amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames . Oh well .. you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea . McGavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best . Definitely deserves a place in TV 's " Hall of Fame " . To quote Tony Vincenzo .. ' Kolchack you are ON IT ' .. Or , in the case of the Hall of Fame , ' IN it ' !  
  Magicians is a wonderful ride from start to finish , thanks in large part to the magic that is generated by the stars . Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades . Like any really fine film , it 's a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming . I can't believe this film is SO difficult to find - I 'd buy it on DVD in a heartbeat but have yet to find an outlet .  
  First ever viewing : July 21 , 2008 Very impressive screenplay and comedic acting and timing in this film . Now 40 years old , it has lost none of it 's power . Neil Simon displays excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create genuine comedy from unusual situations . Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedic performances . Neil Simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the play this film is based on . One of the best written and acted Hollywood comedies of all time ! Surprisingly , only nominated for 2 Academy Awards : " Best Adapted Screenplay " and " Best Film Editing " . Hollywood rarely awards comedies , no matter how well they are made .  
  For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror strip cartoon , viewing this film is an exercise in nostalgia . In that context it is wonderful , but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy limp and would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters . The plotline is also a bit limp for today 's audience , but reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s very well . Jane , you must remember , was part of the escapist fantasy of the wartime years , created to boost the morale of the troops . She gave a double meaning to the " strip " in strip cartoon . The story has something in common with the tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard . The theme would have been a familiar one to readers in that era , a bunch of bumbling Nazis thwarted by a few equally bumbling Englanders , and set in the African jungle of course . For Jane fans , a must see . For the rest of you , a damp squib .  
  This movie , even though is about one of the most favorite topics of Mexican producers producers : the extreme life in our cities , has a funny way to put it on the screen . Four of the more important Mexican directors , of the last times , approach histories of our city framed in diverse literary sorts as it can be the farce or the satire , which gives us a film with a over exposed topic in our country , but narrated in a very different way which gives a freshness tone him . With actors little known , but that interprets of excellent way their paper , each one of the directors reflect in the stories the capacity by we have been identified anywhere in the world , that capacity of laugh the pains and to make celebration of the sadness . Perhaps to many people in our country the film not have pleased , but I consider that people of other countries could find attractive and share the surrealism of the Mexican .  
  I agree with the above comment , I love the realism in this , and in many movies ( not just movies on eating disorders ) the producers seem to forget that . They take an every day problem and create a hugely dramatic scene and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again , which I dislike because its not reality . Not meaning to say things can't get better , and not meaning to say things don't in this movie , but it doesn't spend most of the movie creating all these problems , and come the end of the movie everything is perfect again . When people have eating disorders people don't just admit it and want to get better , and then life is peachy , it takes time , and I like how in this movie we grow with the characters , we go through the difficulties with them , getting better and worse , because it is a very important part of the movie . It gets into the minds of people with eating disorders , and shows the complications and pain , in a very realistic way , and I loved that . I also love how it shows The secrecy and betrayal people feel when suffering from eating disorders , it is scary to see how people react when they find out , especially if they approve of it . I thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told , and defiantly one of my favourites .  
  I have seen this movie a whole dozen times and it 's awesome . But the only thing with it was that in the beginning , there was too much talk of who 's going out with who . I think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it . But on the official site , they said that they will not be making a remake of it because so many people have gotten saved when viewing it . What 's even happened to Patty Dunning now ? She is a pretty good actress . She has done several other movies in the 70s and 80s , but we haven't heard from her since . I know for sure about Thom Rachford , who plays Jerry , works for Accounting at RD Films . But overall , I have to say that the series itself is like Left Behind gone old school .  
  Obviously , there wasn't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production . But the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot . I mean brutal on the level of Ju Dou and other ( great ) Chinese films . I first saw this when I was 14 years old , I ran home and begged God to forgive me for everything ..  
  when my sister said this movie was gonna be good i had second thoughts but i watched it and it was actually funny . basically the movie is made of a weird girl who goes to a small town where no one likes her and she just wants to go there and get the reading of her aunts will don so she can go . but its not all that easy . In this movie you will come across hilarious humor , a witch , a book of spells / recopies , a mentally challenged uncle and a dog . You will understand the meaning of the word freak a after anyways i hope you run right out and try to find this really old movie . hope you like it in total i will have to give it a 0 .. no I 'm totally joking ill give it a 9 hope you understand that you will laugh , you will scream and you may just be offended . love yours truly : Dakota you can email me at dakota_loves_it @ hot mail . com if you wanna  
  What a good film ! Made Men is a great action movie with lots of twists and turns . James Belushi is very good as an ex hood who has stolen 12 million from the boss who has to fend of the gangsters , hillbillies his wife and the local sheriff ( Timothy Dalton ) . you wont be disappointed , jump on board and enjoy the ride . 8 out of 10  
  This , along with " Hare Tonic , " ranks as one of the best Bugs cartoons , indeed one of the best Bugs , ever . There are some comments about how Bugs in these cartoons is " basic , " meaning , I guess , that he is as yet not fully developed . I actually prefer this " basic " version from the mid-40s ( Chuck Jones ' was the best version ) who is actually more rabbit-sized and far more amusing than the eventual long-legged version who towered over Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck . The latter-day Bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking . Also check out " Hair Raising Hare " ( 1946 ) and " Rabbit Punch " ( 1948 ) for great examples of classic Bugs and classic Chuck Jones .  
  The opening credits make for a brilliant , atmospheric piece of escapist entertainment that 's full of little nods to the comic strip . All the good guys are good , all the bad guys are bad , and the film is jam-packed with familiar character actors covered in gruesom make-up to hi-lite their characteristics . Warren Beatty , as Dick Tracy , is the ultimate tough guy straight man , incorruptable , calm usually , always a better fighter than the other guy , and rarely one to push the limit on legality . Al Pacino , as " Big Boy " Caprice steals every scene he 's in as a hunch-backed gangster in some unnamed metropolis of 1930s gangsters . Maddonna plays the kind of person she 'd probably play best , Breathless Mahoney , a nightclub singer and femme fatale with her own little agenda going . Gleanne Headly is Tracy 's tough-talking , fiercely independent long-time girlfrined . And then there 's The Kid , a funny little street urchin Tracy takes in , who models himself after his surrogate father , and saves Tracy when the detective has accepted his fate of being blown up . The supporting players are a Who 's Who of character actors . Charles Durning is the chief of police . Dick Van Dyke is the District Attorney , who 's bribed by Big Boy 's goons to keep him on the streets . Dustin Hoffman has a humorous turn as Mumbles , the snitch whose dialect is so indecipherable the cops can't make head nor tail of what he has to say . R.G. Armstrong is Pruneface , one of the rival gangsters Big Boy forms a special allegiance to in order to create a network of crime spreading throughout the whole city . Mandy Patinkin is 88 Keys , the piano player for Breathless 's show . Paul Sorvino plays Lips Manlis , Breathless 's former benefactor until Big Boy gives him " the Bath . " James Caan wears relatively little make-up in his performance as the only gangster who won't go along with Big Boy 's grand plan . William Forsythe and Ed O'Ross are Big Boy 's enforcers , Flattop and Itchy . This movie retains all of the corn of the comic strip , plus it is full of vibrant colors . Almost all the suits are elaborate in blues and greens and yellows and reds . All the colors of the rainbow are found in this movie-and then some ! The matte paintings that are used truly realize this world as two-dimensional , only acted in three-dimensional sets . The humor is plentiful . Al Pacino fills the shoes of his character like no other character he 's played before or since . Big Boy is kind of crazy , and kind of self-pitying . He 's an eccentric little man who takes pride in quoting our Founding Fathers and likening himself to great political leaders . The man with the plan , always looking for the smartest way to do business .  
  Time for a rant , eh : I thought Spirit was a great movie to watch . However , there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7 ( I 'm being a little bit generous with the 7 ) . Point # 1 : Matt Damon aggravates me . I was thinking , ' what a dicky voice they got for the main character , ' when I first heard him narrate - and then I realized it is Matt Damon . The man bugs me so very bad - his performance in " The Departed " was terrible and ruined the movie for me ( before the movie got a chance to ruin itself , but that 's another story for some other time ) , as it almost did " Spirit " . I was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was .. thankfully . Point # 2 : Brian Adams sucks .. The whole score was terrible .. The songs were unoriginal , generic , and poorly executed ; not once did I find the music to fit ; and the lyrics were terrible . Every time one of the lame songs came on , I was turned off . I almost thought I 'd start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super-American freedom style lyrics ( I couldn't help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 9/11 ) . In light of the native American aspects of the film , they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments , not petty radio-hit , teen-bop , 14-year-old-girl crap . I thought I was back in junior high school . I can't believe no better could have been done-I refuse to . Had it not have been for this , I 'd rank the film up more with Disney , which knows a thing or two about originality ( ok , don't bother saying what I know some of you are probably thinking ; ) . Too bad , it 's a shame they couldn't have hired better musicians . I liked the art and animation , except for some things here and there .. like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body ( thick / dark lines mainly near the end ) . There were often times when I thought they _ tried too hard _ on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion . But there were also times when the emotion ran thick . Anyhow , many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent . OK , I 'm falling asleep here so I 'll sum it up before I start making less sense .. Nice try on an epic film .. it turned out mediocre though . Matt Damon , you suck !  
  This movie was highly entertaining . The soundtrack ( Bian Adams ) is simply beautiful and inspiring . Even more impressive is Brian Adams doing all the songs in French as well . The score is also uplifting and dramatic . The movie is made from a mix of traditional animation , combined with computer generated images . The result is truly stunning . I watch this film at least once a week with my kids and we never tire of it . The story is compelling and well narrated . I don't understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7 . Definately a keeper in my household .  
  This is one of my favorite films of all time . Al Pacino acting is at its best and the story is excellent . Too bad it didn't do to well in the 80 's when it was first released because people didn't get a chance to experience this classic .  
  I found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis . When Leo , the oldest announces that he is HIV + the reactions of the family members alone and with each other was touching and yet strange . I have never seen a family that was as physically demonstrative as this one ; nor one as likely to shout at each other . I didn't understand why the family felt that youngest couldn't deal with the news but once past that difficult I found this a thoroughly moving film .  
  The memory of the " The Last Hunt " has stuck with me since I saw it in 1956 when I was 13 . It is a movie that was far ahead of others at the time in that it addressed the treatment of the natives , the environment , and the ever present contrast between the short and long term effects of greed . It is as relevant today as in 1956 , a cinemagraphic discussion of utmost depth and relevance . To top it off the setting is beautiful and the cinematography excellent . The memory of this movie will be with me to the end of my days .  
  Scoop * out of * Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director , but I enjoyed " Match Point . " It was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star Woody Allen . It did have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it . " Scoop " is Woody Allen 's latest film and though he appears in this one , it 's OK . It also features Scarlett Johansson and the two of them work perfect together . Johansson plays Sondra Pransky , a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of Joe Strombel ( Ian McShane . ) Joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the Reaper has taken . One of those souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman ( Hugh Jackman . ) She tells Joe that Peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of England . Joe , with the scoop of a life time , travels back to the living and gives this info to Sondra , during a magic act . Sondra is at some magic show with Magician Sid Waterman ( Woody Allen . ) She becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box , she gets the visit from Joe . Not knowing what to do , she enlists the help of Sid Waterman to help her crack the case . This film has a nice light-hearted feel to it compared to " Match Point " and yet it all works . Johansson and Allen work great together . Allen 's humor fits perfect for this story and role . Hugh Jackman is terrific as Peter Layman , the " suspected " serial killer . This is a fun little movie to see if your ever looking for one to watch . The cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching Woody Allen be himself . I say give it a chance because you just might like it .  
  I don't know if this is a sitcom or not , but I agree that this is one of the greatest television shows ever . It 's great that this show still airs . And I love Michelle . It 's cute on the episodes when she was a baby and she talked , and she sometimes said something funny . Aw . This show can relate to children and teens and .. well , families as they struggle through rough times and try to work it out as a family . I don't know who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone . I love the episode when I think her name is DD .. the older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt , and she learned a lesson about stealing . That was a great episode . An example that this TV show shows the family working things out as a family . I recommend this show for everyone .  
  Full House is a great show . I am still today growing up on it . I started watching it when i was 8 and now i am 12 and still watching it . i fell in love with all of the characters , especially Stephanie . she is my favorite . she had such a sense of humor . in case there are people on this sight that hardly watch the show , you should because you will get hooked on it . i became hooked on it after the first show i saw , which just happened to be the first episode , in 2002 . it really is a good show . i really think that this show should go down to many generations in families . and it 's great too because it is an appropriate show for all ages . and for all parents , it teaches kids lessons on how to go on with their life . nothing terrible happens , like violence or swearing . it is just a really great sit-com . i give it 5 out of 5 stars . what do you think ? OH and the best time to watch it is when you are home sick from school or even the old office . It will make you feel a lot better . Trust me i am hardly home sick but i still know that it will make you feel better . and to everybody that thinks the show is stupid , well that 's too bad for you because you won't get as far in life even if you are happy with your life . you really should watch it and you will get hooked on it . i am just telling you what happened to me and everybody else that started watching this awesome show . well i need must go to have some lunch . remember you must start watching full house and soon !  
  This is by far the most incredible movie I have seen in a long time . The actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie . The story was accurately portrayed . The story starts out with a young woman from the British Isles and her father traveling by steamboat to Nauvoo , Illinois . She has become a member of the LDS Church and he has not . He thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraging . She encourages him to read about Joseph Smith , the Prophet . This is where the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins . The movie accurately portrays his life and some of the history of the LDS Church at the same time . It was graphic at times , but was needed . The emotional expression was very believable , which caused my emotions to spill out . Filming was awesome . The way in which the story was presented was touching . After the movie was over , we just sat there unable to moved . I was stunned . For people who know very little of Joseph Smith , the Mormon Prophet , I would encourage you to see this . If nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life . For those who are members of the Church , I would encourage you to see it . It will increase your testimony of this most incredible man . This is a must see .  
  I have to say that this TV movie was the work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is . We are so used to , now , seeing her in a sitcom and I really hope that a TV station will show this TV movie again soon as it will show the Sabrina fans that MJH shines in a drama . Seen as we have watched her on Sabrina now for now 5 years and so to give the viewers a taste of her much unused talent would be a plus . Melissa plays her role so well in this wanting her parents " done away " with so she can be with the guy she loves . One thing that all Sabrina viewers will notice , Melissa works with David Lascher in this , well before he took the role of Josh on Sabrina . So it would be kind of neat to see this currently whenever it gets aired again . Hopefully MJH gets some good roles in movies or even in more TV Movies , sort of like Kellie Martin who has always shined in TV Movies . Lots of unused talent waiting to bust out when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart , you shine always Melissa !  
  The movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin . The main protagonist / antagonist Jennifer Stanton ( Hart ) is a typical all American teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father ( Baldwin ) . However , when she meets an ex con called Nick Ryan ( Jeremy Jordan " Never been kissed " ) they instantly ' fall ' for each other , but Jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship . she manipulates him to kill her parents , to protect their ' love ' but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with Brad ( David Lascher future ' Sabrina ' cast mate for Hart ) . Melissa Joan Hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder . The rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time . I also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year , Hart , began portrayed Sabrina , the Teenage Witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television . Although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to ' Nine Dead ' that comes out in November because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called " Clarissa Darling " or Sabrina Spellman " I recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina . You can watch this on the internet , so i suggest check it out .  
  MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS is a mesmerizing 1945 B thriller from Joseph H . Lewis , arguably one of the very finest directors of Hollywood noir films . This 65 minute Gothic oddity from Columbia Pictures came after Lewis ' lengthy apprenticeship as the helmer of a string of poverty row westerns , East Side Kids comedies , horror melodramas ( including the incredibly bizarre Bela Lugosi shocker THE INVISIBLE GHOST ) and standard studio B product ( SECRETS OF A CO-ED , BOMBS OVER BURMA , THE FALCON IN SAN FRANCISCO , etc ) - all of which set the stage rather nicely for what was to come from the enormously talented and inventive Mr . Lewis . MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS ( as well as SO DARK THE NIGHT from the following year ) introduced a director who had mastered the rare and delicate art telling a dark and probing tale swiftly and efficiently on the most modest of budgets . Later Lewis productions like GUN CRAZY ( 1949 ) and THE BIG COMBO ( 1955 ) , despite the expanded scope of their narrative structure , continued to rely upon deft , lucid camera work and effective low-key lighting . And very modest resources . MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS probably owes more to the tradition of British mysteries ( it 's set in a studio-bound England ) than it does to conventional film noir attitudes and trappings . A young woman ( Nina Foch ) agrees to take a position in the home of an elderly woman ( Dame Mae Witty ) . Two days after her arrival she awakens from a deep sleep in a completely strange house and , mysteriously enough , with a brand new identity-that of the old woman 's daughter-in-law . Told that she 's been the victim of a nervous breakdown , she struggles to grasp the utter and seemingly hopeless nature of her predicament . But before long she begins to piece together the strange and troubling truth behind this dark mystery , that her " husband " ( the always menacing George Macready ) most probably murdered his real wife and that she 's been duped into participating in a harrowing and sinister scheme . Much of what distinguishes this otherwise modest tale are the indelible touches that Lewis brings to the production , marking it as the first of his truly serious endeavors as a film director .  
  The premise of this anime series is about bread , of all things to base a plot on ! I truly laughed . The main character has a special bread making power that he was born with , and he goes off to bread baking school . I wish it were available on DVD , and it doesn't matter if it 's subtitled or dubbed - it 's that good . Even the theme song alone is funny . At one point in the theme song , there 's an African-Japanese man with an afro on horseback , wielding a French baguette as if it were a samurai sword . These images will not make sense unless you see the anime . You 'll laugh until your sides hurt . It is definitely the most unique anime I have seen thus far .  
  From the writer of " What Ever Happened to Baby Jane ? " and " Hush .. Hush , Sweet Charlotte , " this tail-end of the sixties horror cycle has some eerie and campy fun . Micheál Macliammóir does a Victor Buono-type bit , but too often the movie totters dangerously close to a bad musical .. there 's a particularly awful children 's recital about halfway through . Debbie taps , tangos and tricks up a lá Harlow , while Winters ' religious fanatic has a lesbian edge to her . Agnes Moorehead checks in as an evangelist . Weaver has nothing to do - and even has to pay a gigolo to dance with Debbie .  
  First a quick ' shut up ! ' to those saying this movie stinks . You can't go to every movie expecting ' Citizen Kane ' . This was actually a fun movie . Jason Lee is good in everything he does . The only flaw in this movie is , I don't think there was enough chemestry between Lee and Julia Stiles . They should have dwelled more on that . Other than that , the movie is good fun . Selma Blair needs to eat something . She 's worrying me . But she still looks beautiful . So yes , I recommend this movie for a date or light saturday afternoon fun . Go see . RATING : * 1/2 out of *  
  Surreal film noir released soon after the " real , " genre-defining classics " The Maltese Falcon , " " Double Indemnity " and " The Postman Always Rings Twice . " Welles films shouldn't be evaluated against others . He was playing by different rules . In fact , he was playing . This starts where other femme fatale films leave off , so the vaguely logical ( but interesting ) whodunit is embellished with a display of Wellesian scenes ( typical rapid-fire style ) , dialog ( lots of " hard-boiled " philosophy ) , and unusual acting ( good Hayworth presumably intentionally one-dimensional ) . To Welles " genre " may have meant " formula " but he seemed to like using " mysteries " as backgrounds for his " entertainments . "  
  This could be well have been THE definitive film noir of all time , had not the Columbia Studios cut so much of Orson Welles 's original . What we are left with is a flawed , yet brilliant film that showcases the overwhelming talent of Welles as an actor / director and Rita Hayworth as a serious dramatic talent . ' The Lady From Shanghai ' is film noir at it 's most sizzling and confusing . Welles , with an uneven accent , portrays Michael O'Hara , a journeyman Irishman , who , after a fateful encounter with the seductive , dangerous Elsa Bannister ( Hayworth , in a GREAT performance ) finds himself virtually coerced into accepting a job as a crewman on her and her crippled husband 's ( Everett Sloane ) yacht . Elsa , or ' Rosalie ' as Michael likes to call her , plays the innocent , helpless doll very well , ensnaring O'Hara in her web . As the lovers conduct a not-so-secret affair at sea , Arthur Bannister 's partner in his law firm , George Grisby ( Glenn Anders ) comes aboard . He is a weird , untrustworthy figure who offers Michael a unique proposal : He will get $ 5000 to assist Grisby in the faking of Grisby 's death , so it looks murder . The plan is for Michael to get off a technicality , and run off into the sun with Elsa . But things do not go to plan . Hayworth delivers us one of the best femme fatales of all time in a very ambiguous portrayal . At times she seems genuinely vulnerable and child-like , at others brutal , world-weary and hard . Always she is brilliantly beautiful , whether he situation calls for her to be dripping wet in a swimsuit or dressed in black , brandishing a gun . Hayworth is beautifully photographed here , and she is a far-cry from her famous ' Gilda ' role . Her then-husband Orson Welles cut off her trademark auburn locks for a dyed blonde crop ( angering Columbia boss Harry Cohn ) . It was a terrific marketing ploy , and he change suits her changed attitude wonderfully . She is not the sympathetic femme fatale that ' Gilda ' is , here - instead she is a predatory , black-hearted dame who sees murder as a very useful option . The Welles and Hayworth pairing came at a time when the couple were having extreme difficulties in their marriage . They would divorce after the film was made , so this is also a curiosity for providing some view into the complicated relationship . They are hateful , not romantic , lovers in this , so it 's hard to gauge whether or not they had real chemistry on screen . Certainly every encounter is potent and filled with raw sexuality , with Welles as the ' fall guy ' ( he even admits it himself in the film ! ) and Rita as the double-crossing babe . Welles character is the typical noir ' drifter ' with not much sense . As Welles voice-over proves to use , O'Hara indeed does not use his brain very much ' expect to be thinking of her ( Elsa ) ' . Welles usually played intelligent , charismatic fellows , so his turn here as the dim-witted Michael is unusual and very interesting . Indeed , Welles was an actor of fine talent and he pulls off it well . Everett Sloane is suitably slimy as Hayworth 's crippled husband . One wonders why he hires Michael . It is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantically , so why does he invite a ' threat ' on board ? One interpretation could be that Michael provides the ' service ' to his wife that Bannister cannot in his crippled state . There is definitely something to that theory , with a lot of implications toward Elsa 's behaviour before she met her husband ( was she some sort of prostitute ? ) and Grisby 's knowledge of Bannister 's most intimate secrets being hinted at in several scenes . This is a jumbled , convoluted film with a plot that is ultimately flawed . We are more interested in the love triangle than the murder plot , as with most noirs . Welles provides us with many of his usual brilliant cinematic touches , including the justifiably famous ' hall of mirrors ' climax . It 's a terrific scene , one ending that can almost obliterate the faults earlier on in the movie and lift it into greatness . This fun house scene is visually stunning , with a Dali-like feel to the painted sets ( apparently Orson painted them himself ) . Subtle visual imagery utilized throughout the film by Welles enhances the plot and makes this a thought-provoking experience . The dialogue is scorching and confusing , delivered superbly by Rita 's alternately breathy low voice and helpless , high-pitched little-girl voice . Hayworth proves her acting capabilities in this one , and proves that SHE is the ultimate femme fatale of ' noir ' . It 's a pity ( only a slight one , as Rita was a brilliant dancer ) that she did so many delightful yet frothy and often forgettable musicals for Columbia in the 40 's instead of darkly-themed noir like this . She was a brilliant actress when given the chance to show off her talent . 9/10 .  
  The first mystery is to guess what Welles ' original film was like . That makes this a real adventure - to see an incomplete skeleton and using cinematic forensics , imagine the beautiful woman it once supported . If you do , you will both see and experience perhaps one of the best film mysteries ever . As mysteries go , the narrative is rather ordinary : a simple diversion , one jealous husband as red herring . What 's rather miraculous is Welles ' placement of the story in an artificial eye seeing a dark , dark multifaceted world . The first real noir , but even darker . It 's not an obviously twisted world , unless you think about the camera . What we can see firsthand is someone creating a vocabulary that would later become common . For all the celebration , Kane was a success because of the great drama and story . The camera 's eye was shocking , but experimental . Welles would go from there to explore the mystery narrative and the self-reference of Shakespeare with this eye . Othello and MacBeth are both begun in this period , and I consider them part of a single vision with this . The noir feel here hinges on the notion that people are not in charge of their lives , even a little - they are manipulated by random factors in the environment . So in telling this story , Welles has to make the environment into a character . Several characters as suspects in the mystery . Thus we have the famous lighting , blocking and angles we know ( and have since seen countless times ) . And we have the deliberately closed sets : the park , yacht , picnic area , aquarium , dock , courtroom , Chinese theater and funhouse . I am certain that what was cut by the barbarians was lots and lots of ' external ' narrative dealing not with character but with these strange environments . My own solution to the mystery is that the funhouse did it , among the other character-environments introduced as suspects . In other words , the manipulation of Black Irish ( who we know from notes and one scene typing at the union hall was an aspiring novelist ) was neither : a force of human conspiracy ( the park or the civilized version , the courtroom ) nor of nature ( the picnic or the civilized version , the aquarium ) . Instead it was a matter of deliberate caprice by the gods for amusement . This is of course a self-reference to what Welles is doing : putting these people ( including himself ) through hell for our own caprice , a matter underscored by the Peking Opera set with Welles doped up . And of course leading to the funhouse where the environment directly tinkers with perception . More about the self-reference : surely there is conscious comment on his relationship with his soon to be exwife . But I believe there is strong subconscious comment on his own taunting the environment in which he worked , the studio environment . Surely Welles was as much screwed with , and in much the same way , as his character . And that screwing took the form of the murder of this film , leaving the rotting corpse mentioned at the beginning of this comment . That poor Rita comes from China ties up the whole thing , the Chinese theater , the expected rape from above , the loss of the woman . The investment in environment beyond all .  
  One can only imagine the film Mr . Welles might have finished without the interference of the studio ! This film is a flawed Welles , but worth every minute of it because one can see the greatness of perhaps America 's best motion picture director of all times ! We can see the toll it took on Orson Welles the filming of this movie . The story has a lot of holes in it , perhaps because of the demands of the studio executives that didn't trust the director . It is curious by reading some of the opinions submitted to IMDB that compare Orson Welles with the Coen brothers , Roman Polanski , even Woody Allen , when it should be all of those directors that must be regarded as followers of the great master himself . No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr . Welles . Lucky are we to still have his legacy either in retrospective looks such as the one the Film Forum in New York just ended , or his films either on tape or DVD form . Rita Hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here . If she was a beauty with her red hair , as a blonde , she is just too stunning for words . Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the movie . The only thing that might have made this film another masterpiece to be added to Orson Welles body of work , was his own appearance in it . Had he concentrated in the directing and had another actor interpret Michael O'Hara , a different film might have been achieved altogether . Orson Welles has to be credited for being perhaps a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio lot into the street . The visuals in this film are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing this movie truly impressed for the work , the vision and the talent he gave us .  
  Of all the film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s , this has to rank as one of the strangest , and most fun to watch . I say that because of the four main actors : Orson Welles , Rita Hayworth , Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders . The first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me , especially Anders . His character , " George Grisby , " is one of the strangest people I 've ever seen on film . His voice , and some of the things he said , have to be heard to be believed . Slaone isn't far behind in the " strange " category . Hayworth is not as glamorous with short , blonde hair but still is Hayworth , which means a lot to ogle if you are a guy . Welles ' is as fascinating as always . One tip : if you have the DVD , turn on the English subtitles . His character in this movie is an Irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says . Welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups . You also have a unique ending , visually , with a shootout in a house of mirrors . Great stuff ! As bizarre as this film is , I still thought the buffoon-like carnival atmosphere at the trial near the end was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene . Other than that , no complaints . This is great entertainment , which is the name of the game .  
  I saw True Crime when it was first released back in the mid-nineties and I have watched it many times since . It is a great mystery about Mary ( played by Alicia Silverstone ) , a high school senior in a California town who 's classmate 's younger sister was tortured and killed by an unknown murderer . Mary meets Tony ( played by Kevin Dillon ) , a police cadet who sees how bright she is and they decide to work together to try to find the killer . Many suspects in this one . True Crime feels very " true " or real to me . I read a newsgroup review where someone wrote that total suspension of disbelief is present here and it is so true . Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job , as do the other actors . The locations are right on and the writer / director , Pat Verducci , really captures some of the realities of teenage life and of Mary 's loneliness ( see the scene where Mary awakens from the dream sequence after having viewed the photos she took of Tony ) . I wish Verducci would make more movies . I have not seen any other movie quite like True Crime . 10/10  
  I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it . I would recommend it to other people . It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot . And I am thinking since it 's close to Halloween they might play it more . So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it . I believe that Alicia Silverstone played her part very well . I really like her as an actress and person . She seems so nice and down to earth . Kevin Dillon he 's performance was so so for me . I am not trying to knock him or anything but I believe that his brother Matt would have been able to pull this bad evil serial killer persona better . Kevin just seems too sweet for me . But I think he did okay .  
  THE MELTING MAN .. a tragic victim of the space race , he perished MELTING .. never comprehending the race had LONG GONE BY .. ! A man ( Burr DeBenning ) burns his hand on the kitchen stove . But instead of screaming something a NORMAL person would scream , he shouts something that sounds like " AATCH-KAH ! " This movie you 've popped in .. isn't a normal movie . You 've just taken your first step into THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN , the famous late-70 's gore film featuring Rick Baker 's wonderful makeup effects . Baker was just on the edge of becoming a superstar , and did this at the same time as his famous " cantina aliens " in STAR WARS . For some strange reason , STAR WARS became a household name , and INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN did not . It might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just mind-numbingly awful . From the opening credits ( " Starring Alex Rebar as THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN " .. that 's really what it says ! ) , to the chubby nurse running through a glass door , to the fisherman 's head going over a waterfall and smashing graphically apart on some rocks , this film provides many , many moments of sheer incomprehensibility . " Why did they .. but how come he .. why are they .. ? " After a while , you give up wondering why and watch it as what it is-a very entertaining piece of garbage . An astronaut returns to Earth in a melting , radioactive condition ; he escapes and , his mind disintegrating as well as his body , begins a mad melting killing spree . The authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped , but ( probably not wanting to " cause a panic " ) want him captured as quietly as possible . So they send one guy with a geiger counter after him . Wow . Storywise , surprisingly little happens during the movie . The melting guy wanders around killing people . A doctor searches for him with a geiger counter . Various characters are introduced , ask questions , and leave . Eventually the doctor catches up with the melting man , but is shot by a security guard for no reason , after he explains that he 's " Dr . Ted Nelson . " The melting man wanders off and finally dissolves into a big puddle of goo . The End . It 's so brainless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun , despite a fairly downbeat ending . Supposedly , a widescreen DVD release is planned . A very special movie .  
  Astronaut Steve West ( Alex Rebar ) and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of Saturn . His comrades are killed instantly , but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones . Steve returns to Earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp ; as he turns into a savage killer , melting every step of the way , he is tracked by his friend , Dr . Ted Nelson ( Burr DeBenning ) . This is often so uproariously funny - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - that it 's hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional . It seems to me to be kind of a goof on low-budget genre efforts from the ' 50 's and 60 's , and as such , it 's a marvelously entertaining movie . That sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious . We 're even treated to a split screen sequence that doesn't really add anything , but is still a gas to watch . Writer / director William Sachs deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea ; his ultra-slimy character is a memorable one indeed . I think his pacing is a little off ; some scenes ( like the one with the elderly couple ) go on a little long , but ultimately he delivers solid , schlocky , B-movie goods with a degree of panache . The climax is especially fun . Arlon Obers ' music is enjoyably shuddery ( yet also amusingly silly during some moments ) , and Willy Curtis 's cinematography creates some really great shots at times . That brings me to Rick Bakers ' fantastic and convincing makeup effects , which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie , right down to the ultimate final melt . Rebar is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie ( Sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running ) and does what he has to do well enough . DeBenning makes for a rather oafish and silly hero , and Ann Sweeney isn't so hot either as his wife , but Myron Healey , Michael Alldredge , and Lisle Wilson are fine in support . It 's also worth it to see folk like Cheryl " Rainbeaux " Smith ( doing an appreciable topless shot ) , Janus Blythe ( of Tobe Hoopers ' " Eaten Alive " and Wes Cravens ' " The Hills Have Eyes " ) , and even director Jonathan Demme in a bit part . This is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore , chills , and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of low-grade sci-fi / horror everywhere . 8/10  
  Mating Game is a charming , wonderful movie from an era gone by . Hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie . My wife and I would go see it . It is an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and I watched on AMC . This movie has Tony Randall at his best . Debbie Reynolds is great , as always . Loved it . We plan on ordering on DVD to add to our growing collection of movies . Too bad Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore . Hey Hollywood .. time to dig some of these type of scripts out of the old safe , update them a bit ( without spoiling the original movie and script as you have done with other remakes ) , and hold a casting call . A remake would be a big hit on the silver screen , DVD , and on cable / SATTV . SN Austin , TX  
  This is a better adaptation of the book than the one with Paltrow ( although I liked that one , too ) . It isn't so much that Beckinsale is better - they are both very good - but that the screenplay is better . Davies is a master at adapting Austen for filming , and the production values here are very good . It 's not quite as glossy as the Hollywood treatment , but it 's close , and I thought that the locations and the costumes actually worked better .  
  There are 21 comments as I add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism . This is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in it . It is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my 15-year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action , to the humour and even to the beautiful music score . I buy DVDs only when I know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the UK , I will certainly be adding it to my collection .  
  I saw this movie in my childhood . And after 10 years I did not remember anything about this movie but I found out it I also don't know how I was able to find out this movie . Its my life . My all times favorite movie . My words will fall short of true meaning what I have inside for this movie . I follow this movie . It 's a brilliant mix of fantasy , comedy , romance , horror , erotic , scary and martial arts . The story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm . It 's a masterpiece of Hong Kong Cinema . Sinnui Yauman , is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film . Written by Songling Pu and directed by Siu-Tung Ching , A Chinese Ghost Story has it all . Ling Choi Sin played by Leslie Cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for lodging , deep in the woods , a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near . The trek alone is perilous with wolves , and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple . Ling Choi Sin meets Tsing , a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple . She is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress , but when she meets innocent Ling Choi Sin they fall in love . Ling Choi Sin is sort of a bumbling fool but his heart is in the right place , while Tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods , he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods . There 's great martial arts , even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual taoist sword forms . The movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films acrobatics , with magic and flying through the air , leaping from tree to tree , with elegant long gowns and scarves , but the movie genuinely flows , and everything is effective . Tsing is to be married to a evil tree monster , which cant be good , and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice . In the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue , and go with Yin deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls , and bring Ling 's ashes back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnation . A beautiful story that truly pays attention to details . One is touched in many ways by this movie , you 'll laugh , cry , and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography . And though at the end , Yin and Ling Choi Sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting rainbow , we never know if Tsing was afforded a reincarnation , but we do know her .  
  Rented and watched this short ( < 90 minutes ) work . It 's by far the best treatment Modesty has received on film - and her creator , Peter O'Donnell , agrees , participating as a " Creative Consultant . " The character , and we who love her , are handled with respect . Spiegel 's direction is the best he 's done to date , and the casting was very well done . Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect as a match to the original Jim Holdaway illustrations of Modesty . A terrific find by whoever cast her ! Raymond Cruz as a young Rafael Garcia was also excellent . I hope that Tarantino & co . will go on to make more in the series - I 'm especially interested to see whom they 'd choose to be the incomparable Willie Garvin !  
  Short synopsis This film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men . One of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses . Later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the Christmas holidays . Hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival ( during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids , so it is really serious ) . With exposed , well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape  only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women . One gets caught , the other remains free and is not given away by his companion . A last encounter , a last light for a cigarette , adieu l'ami , farewell , friend . I found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters , played by classical he-man superstars Alain Delon and Charles Bronson . They are obviously attracted to each other , their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout . The whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow , a little like Deliverance . It is also very stylish . The safe the two men want to crack is in a  for the time  ultra modern glass and aluminum tower . It is the seat of a publicity firm , so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around . The wardrobe is also very good . The ultra stylish Citroen DS ( maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times ) features large in this movie  perhaps a subtle kind of product placement . I can recommend this movie for the actor 's performances alone . Delon and Bronson are really sharing the top billing , in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting . Both do a considerable amount of acrobatics . I have never seen Bronson better than here , he really acts - and speaks French throughout , with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed . And it is certainly the man himself we hear . ( So the French language version is highly recommended ) . The police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite Franch character actors , Bernard Fresson who was Gene Hackman 's partner in French Connection II . He is the best brainy police inspector I know . Also very good is former child actress Brigitte Fossey as the young ingénue who , as it turns out , is not so Innocent as it first seems . Anyone who expects the old in-an-out " of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film . For those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience , full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks , although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake .  
  i just saw this movie on TV .. i 've lost my dad when i was young and this movie surely did touch me .. i can feel the lost that the little girl Desi felt .. the feeling of wanting to see her father again .. wanting to talk to him .. or at least given the chance to say goodbye .. and i 'm so touched with the letter that was wrote back to her .. saying that her father read her letter , and sent it back to someone to reply her and buy her a present because there isn't a shop in heaven .. it just lets me feel that miracles do exist ..  
  My family and I have viewed this movie often over the years . It is clean , wholesome , heartbreaking and heartwarming . Showing us the compassion between two families of two countries thousands of miles apart and by the most uncanny of coincidences , it 's almost as if the hand of God had to be intervening . 5 yo Jodelle Micah Ferland who plays Desi the heart stricken little girl , does a magnificent job of acting her part , and for me she was the Priam choice for the lead role . All in all , a 10 out of 10 . There are no downsides to this sweet human story . Children of all ages will tearfully , then joyfully watch this and it will bring the viewing family together with smiles and good feelings .  
  What are the odds of a " Mermaid " helium balloon traveling from Yuba City , Ca . ( on Nov 8th , 1993 ) and landing 4 Days later , ( on Nov . 12 ) in MERMAID , Prince Edward Island , Canada . ( Approx . 4000 miles ) . This is a great movie . It is based on a true story . This movie helps not only children cope with losses , but older people as well . Hope everyone will enjoy it ! Rhonda  
  Zentropa is the most original movie I 've seen in years . If you like unique thrillers that are influenced by film noir , then this is just the right cure for all of those Hollywood summer blockbusters clogging the theaters these days . Von Trier 's follow-ups like Breaking the Waves have gotten more acclaim , but this is really his best work . It is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor . It 's too bad he decided handheld cameras were the wave of the future . It 's hard to say who talked him away from the style he exhibits here , but it 's everyone 's loss that he went into his heavily theoretical dogma direction instead .  
  I consider this film to be the best one about Mike Hammer , with Biff Elliott 's performance the definitive Mike Hammer . Harry Essex 's script is excellent and contains many improvements on Mickey Spillane 's novel . His direction is strong and imaginative , and he makes fine use of light and shadow . The camera work by John Alton is top-notch , as is the score by Franz Waxman . The cast includes many veteran players , as well as Peggie Castle in her memorable performance as Charlotte Manning . All in all , this is one of the finest private eye films ever made . Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should have received more opportunities . I have always treasured this film .  
  In the early to mid 1970 's , Clifford Irving proposed to write the ultimate biography of Howard Hughes , claiming to have spent months preparing for the book , engaged in interviews with the reclusive millionaire . When all of this turned out to be false , Irving was accused of perjury & spent several years behind bars ( although always admitting his findings were accurate ) . Flash forward to 20001 , several months prior to September 11th , a book , entitled ' Forbidden Love ' ( published in the U.S. as ' Honor Lost : Love And Death In Modern Day Jordan ' ) by a previously unknown author by the name of Norma Khouri , a woman from Jordan , who reported on the death by mercy killing of her best friend Dalia , due to the fact that Dalia , being from a devout Muslim background , was dating a Christian man . It , like Irving 's biography on Hughes was revealed as a potential hoax . Australian film maker , Anna Broinowski attempts to delve into the quagmire that was Khouri 's attempts to clear herself of the lie ( s ) . Over the time frame of 104 minutes , the film attempts to reveal is Norma Khouri telling the truth , or is she just a compulsive liar , with an agenda / vendetta of her own ? . Interview footage with those who know / knew her ( including an ex husband , her publisher , and others ) tell their side of the story . This is a toothsome , well produced documentary that manages to point many fingers at just as many potential guilty parties . Not rated , but contains pervasive bad language & a re-enactment of the grisly murder scene , played over a few times ( but nothing nearly as graphic & disturbing as what one would see in the latest torture porn epic , such as Saw : Part 84 ) . Not a good choice for the little ones .  
  It sounds as if it should be a biography of Claude Monet but it 's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a French synchronized swimming team . There are no parents or teachers to speak of , no school , and boys are represented by one peripheral figure , the hunky Francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused . Pauline Aquart is the youngest of the three , only aspiring to join the team she so much admires . She 's kind of odd looking . She 's not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long , bony limbs , big feet , and no derriere to speak of . She 's prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips . After a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling . Adele Haenel is older - more , well , more developed physically . What a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit , sauntering around , teasing the boys , swishing her long blond hair . But she 's not what she seems . Or is she ? I couldn't quite figure it out . The French are long on paradoxes and short on consistency . No wonder Francois is always sniffing after her . There 's not so much ambiguity in Louse Blachere 's character . She 's on the team too but she 's dumpy and plain , and sensitive about it , and has an intense crush on Francois . Blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performance . The movie deals with the relationships between these three , meaning intrigues , deceptions , hidden feelings , and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another . This is of course a tricky topic . It becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between Pauline and Adele . Not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie . The only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on , and what little sex there is under the covers , sometimes literally . I don't think I want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much , partly because it 's suggestive rather than expressed through action , partly because it 's complex , and partly because I 'm not sure I got it all . Let me give an example . Okay . Adele is the girl the others envy . She 's also quite distant and self satisfied . On top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all , from the handsome but dumb Francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from . She brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio . When Pauline approaches her about joining the swim team , Adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys . A superior and self-indulgent narcissist , you know ? But then the soi-disant slut takes the skinny Pauline under her wing and reveals to Pauline that she 's still a virgin . Really ? Yes , really . Pauline begins to draw closer to Adele and Adele finally confesses that she 'd like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like Pauline to do it for her . Pauline , now drawn sexually to Adele , performs the task with subdued relish . NOW Adele would REALLY like to get it on with a man , preferably older and experienced . So she takes Pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows Pauline to the powder room . The two girls stand there staring at one another , neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other . But Adele stands so close that Pauline slowly loosens her own reins , reaches up , and kisses Adele on the lips . Adele steps back , smiling , and says , " There now , that wasn't so bad , was it ? " , and then walks back into the club . That 's a pretty close description of whatever is going on between Pauline and Adele - but what the hell IS going on ? Initially , Adele treats Pauline like an irrelevant child , later like a close friend , finally like a potential lover - and the minute Pauline responds , Adele walks off satisfied . Is she USING Pauline the way she seems to be using men ? Does it satisfy Adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude ? I don't know . I 've slighted Louise Blachere as the third member of the trio , the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity , but I 've only skipped her for considerations of space . Should you see it ? By all means . ( Just compare it to the typical American movie about high school kids . ) For men , some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique , this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot .  
  Lots and lots of information to digest , and if you 've seen Zizek , you know his pace . Also if you haven't seen most of the films or at least some other films by the same directors mentioned in this doc , you will be somewhat lost . And the film list is long . Director includes Hitchcock ( Psycho , Vertigo , Birds ) , Lynch ( Lost Highway , Mullholland Falls , Wild at Heart , Blue Velvet ) , Tarkovsky ( Stalker , Solaris ) and The Conversation ( Coppola ) There are some segway films like , Star Wars : Espisode II , Matrix .. but these I suspect are baits . To be sure , Zizek is never boring , but if you don't buy ( or if you mind ) the psycho analytics , then you 'll be annoyed to no end . But you should not be , as the setting , clips , the way the film interleave with these clips , Zizek 's points are never boring .  
  " CASOMAI " was the last movie I 've seen before getting married , just last year . It was also the first movie I 've searched for , after I was married , because we promised to offer a copy to our priest . Sometimes , reality is not that apart from fiction . To all those who wrote that priests like " Don Camillo " don't exist in real life , I would recommend them to visit my Priest Pe . Nuno Westwood , in Estoril , Portugal : - ) To all others , I would only recommend them to see this movie , before and after the " I do ! " day : - ) Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal  
  Now days , most people don't watch classic movies , such as this . Most of friends only watch movies from the ' 90s to present . Thats kinda stingy . Most old movies like this are masterpieces , unique in their own way . Only because , back when these movies were being thought of and made , thats when ideas were fresh . Now people strain just to think of new ideas . Anyway , to the movie . For true fans of classic horror . This is for you . The movie is based with a investigator from Scotland Yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor , and stumbles on to three other strange occurrences with past residents of the same house . I won't say anymore , for I will ruin the movie more than I already have . But it is a terrific movie for as old as it is . And would never mind watching it again !  
  Four great stories from master Robert Bloch , adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early Seventies , are the base of this excellent Amicus ' production . This was a kind of movie very popular in the Sixties till the mid-Seventies and it 's one of my favorite type of horror movies . This one in particular shines for the episode Sweets to the Sweet , where Christopher Lee is stalked by his evil little girl child , heiress to her mother tradition . Great fun from start to finish , and good to very good are also the other three episodes ( with the last one a bit on the comic side , but with the great addition of Ingrid Pitt , the most famous vampress of the English cinema .  
  Having seen the Peter O'Toole version recently , I was ready to be awed by the smart writing in this version . Little time is spent on the fighting , which I prefer . Instead , we are shown all the many motives underlying both the French and English ( who held Normandy ) politicos and priests who put her to death . Even the worst hypocrite of them all , the archbishop , leaves us with the thought that " Of course , she was innocent . The innocent have always had to suffer for the ambitions of the mighty . She had no idea what she was saying , no idea of the implications of blasphemy or going against the church . Unschooled , she had no idea of what the church 's stand on such matters even was . " Preminger was true to the myths surrounding her death , and I appreciated the preview on the tape that showed the flames reaching up and burning her . Why ? They used gas jets in the movie , and 2 of them were stopped up . Suddenly , the air pressure blew out the stoppage and the flames leaped up right on her . Thankfully for her , they didn't have to repeat the shot as it was SO realistic : she WAS being burned ! Pretty traumatic introduction for an Iowa girl to her new career of acting . John Gielgud performed outstandingly . He is the English politico who is orchestrating the show . He also makes the point that once you condemn someone to death , you don't want to be around to watch them die . You might shrink from your ' duty ' the next time .. not that such delicacies bother the soul of our would-be president . We Christians , even the most anti-Semitic have no problem with falling back on the Old Testament when it comes to capital punishment , even though it was overridden by Jesus ' words . Bring on public executions like this little girl 's . Smelling burnt flesh might bring us respectable folks to our souls ' senses . The only little ' pick ' I have about this film is that we are not shown why the priest who has been so adamantly urging her burning becomes so suddenly so contrite , even to the point of madness . There should have been more expansion of his character , more dialogue-as the sudden ' coming to his senses ' doesn't make sense . And , whether Graham Greene does this deliberately or not , St . Joan is such a self-assured little upstart , you almost but not quite , are glad she meets her come-uppance . And , when she turned down life in prison , for some reason I thought of Anne Sexton , the poet who accused Sylvia Plath of ' stealing her death ' when she committed suicide .. knowing such an action guarantees immortality . You gotta wonder ! If ever there was a good example of obsessive thought and logic-tight compartments , this is one . St . Joan should have turned Buddhist and quieted the ' voices in her mind ' .  
  " El Mar " directed by Catalonian director Agusti Villarona , and based on the novel by Blai Bonet , offers a glimpse of the Spanish history as seen by a Balearic author that takes the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country . The movie concentrates on three friends , and follows them from those early days during the onset of the war in Majorca , to a few years later as two of those friends meet again when they are at a sanatorium , lost in the countryside . We first meet three boys that are playing happily . Not everything is what it seems . The tragic death of one of them points out about the cruelty of the one that commits the evil deed . The boys have excluded a young girl , about their age , from taking part in their games . When we meet the adult Ramallo again , he is on his way to a sanatorium . He seems to be suffering from tuberculosis . To his surprise , Manuel Tur , one of his boyhood friends is also being treated , and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that supervise their health care . It is obvious that Tur looks at Ramallo in a way that only means he is in love with the tough bully . Their relationship will have devastating consequences . Roger Casamajor does a good job with portraying the older Ramallo . Bruno Bergonzino makes an impression as Tur , the vulnerable youth . Antonia Torrens plays Sor Francisca with conviction . Angela Molina , puts an appearance as Carmen , the wife of the caretaker of the institution . Simon Andreu is perfect as Alcantara . " El Mar " is a dark film that clearly shows Agusti Villarona 's talents in making the novel come alive for the viewer .  
  Leslie Charteris ' series of novels of the adventures of the slightly shady Simon Templar ( " The Saint " ) was brought to the screen in the late 1930s with the up and coming George Sanders as Templar . It was a careful choice - Sanders usually would play villains with occasional " nice roles " ( ffoliott in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE , the title hero in THE STRANGE CASE OF UNCLE HARRY , the framed " best friend " of Robert Montgomery in RAGE IN HEAVEN ) . Here his willingness to bend the rules and break a law briefly fit his " heavy persona " , while his good looks and suave behavior made Templar a fit shady hero like Chester Morris ' " Boston Blackie " , and ( to an extent ) Peter Lorre 's " Mr . Moto " . The films are not the best series of movie mystery serials - but they are serviceable . Like Rathbone 's Holmes series or Oland 's Chan 's series the show frequently had actors repeating roles or playing new ones ( the anti-heroine in the film here was played by Wendy Barrie , who would show up in a second film in the series ) . This , and slightly familiar movie sets make the series a comfortable experience for the viewers , who hear the buzz of the dialog ( always showing Sanders ' braininess in keeping one step ahead of the bad guys ) , without noting the obvious defects of the plot . All these mysteries have defects due to the fact that even the best writers of the genre can't avoid repeating old ideas again and again and again . Here the moment when that happened was when one of the cast admitted his affection for Barrie , which she was long aware of . Shortly after he tries to protect her from the police . But as the film dealt with the identity of a criminal mastermind , it became obvious that this person was made so slightly noble as to merit being the mysterious mastermind ( i . e . , the script disguised him as the least likely suspect ) . Barrie is after the proof that her father ( who died in prison ) was framed by the real criminals in a robbery gang . She has several people assisting her - mugs like William Gargan - and she gets advice from the mastermind on planning embarrassing burglaries that can't be pinned on her . The D.A. who got her father convicted ( Jerome Cowan ) is determined to get Barrie and her gang . The only detective who seems to have a chance to solve the case is Jonathan Hale , who is shadowing Sanders but reluctantly working with him . The cast has some nice moments in the script - Hale ( currently on a special diet ) is tempted to eat a rich lobster dinner made for Sanders by Willie Best . He gets a serious upset stomach as a result , enabling Sanders and Barrie to flee Sanders ' apartment . Best has to remind him ( when he feels better ) to head for a location that Sanders told him to go to at a certain time . There is also an interesting role for Gilbert Emery . Usually playing decent people ( like the brow-beaten husband in BETWEEN TWO WORLDS ) he plays a socially prominent weakling here - whose demise is reminiscent of that of a character in a Bogart movie . On the whole a well made film for the second half of a movie house billing in 1939 . It will entertain you even if it does not remain in your memory .  
  Rosenstrasse is a touching story of courage in adversity . Reichdeutch women find that their Jewish Husbands have been locked up pending deportation . One an aristocrat disowned by her family , Lena Fischer , finds herself among the mob as does General Gudarian 's sister . But rank and privilege merit no special consideration . Nor does service to the Reich as a female detainee whose husband is on the Ostfront will learn . In one of the most horrifying scenes of the movie , the guards take the wedding band given by her soldier husband . Lest you think this is typical German brutishness we in America today have Lady Bush imperiously ordering the arrest of Gold Star Mothers ( mothers of US service-members killed in action ) because their very presence is offencive . Little , regrettably , has changed in the 60 years from Der Fuher to Der Fumbler . Fortunately the eight year old daughter Ruth escapes capture . Waiting in the cold on Rosenstrasse Lena Fischer is at first reluctant to take in Ruth responding in a way that we take as typically German . Even Lena Fisher 's brother Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach who is aware of and opposed to the Holocost cautions Lena against it . but Lena chooses to embrace the idea with an American rebelliousness even renaming Ruth , the more aryan sounding name Helga Lehmann . The siege ends favourably on Rosenstrasse but Lena mourns : What happened to Ruth after the war ? Years later Ruth 's daughter Hannah sets out in search of her mother 's past and meets 90 year old Lena under the guise of writing a personal history of the war . I did deem it interesting that Hannah wanted so much to look up the family but never checked on the fate of her grandfather last known to have served on the Ostfront .  
  Another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the Holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama about the Rosenstrasse Protest in Berlin , an event I had not known of , that began in late February , 1943 . The details are given in an addendum that follows this review . The film narrative sets the story of this protest within another , contemporary story that begins in New York City , in the present . Here a well off , non-observant Jewish woman , whose husband has just died , shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual . She goes even further , demanding that her daughter 's non-Jewish fiancé leave the house . The distressed daughter , Hannah ( Maria Schrader ) then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during WWII , in Berlin , her mother , then 8 years old , had been taken in and protected by an Aryan woman . Hannah drops everything , goes to Berlin , and finds this woman , Lena Fischer , now 90 . Hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story . It all seems rather too pat . The film thereafter improves , focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of 1943 that surrounded the protest , in which the fictitious central character is the same Mrs . Fischer at 33 ( played magnificently by Katja Riemann ) , a Baroness and accomplished pianist who is married to Fabian ( Martin Feifel ) , a Jewish concert violinist , one of the men detained at the Rosenstrasse site . The narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in New York City once again . While scenes in the present are color saturated , the 1943 scenes are washed out , strong on blue-gray tones . The quality of acting is generally quite good , what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in Germany and the direction of Margarethe von Trotta , New German Cinema 's most prominent female filmmaker , herself a former actress . The story of the protest is told simply . Only one feature is lacking that would have helped : still-text notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at Rosenstrasse , an outcome that was , as the addendum below makes clear , incredibly positive . " Rosenstrasse " has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics . Overly long , needlessly layered , purveyor of gender stereotypes , manipulative with music : so go the usual raps . It is too long . But I found in this film an austere , powerful , spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on Rosenstrasse where their Jewish relatives and others were detained . I found nothing flashy , contemporary or manipulative in this depiction . The very absence of extreme violence ( no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized ) intensified my tension , which increased incrementally as the film progressed . You keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute . The somberness of the film stayed with me afterward . I awoke often later in the night I saw the film , my mind filled with bleak , melancholic , chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film . For me , that happens rarely . ( In German and English ) . My rating : 8/10 ( B + ) . ( Seen on 05/31/05 ) . If you 'd like to read more of my reviews , send me a message for directions to my websites . Add : The Rosenstrasse Protest : Swept up from their forced labor jobs in what was meant to be the Final Roundup in the national capital , 1700 to 2000 Jews , mostly men married to non-Jewish women , were herded into Rosenstrasse 2-4 , a welfare office for the Jewish community in central Berlin . Because these Jews had German relatives , many of them highly connected , Adolf Eichmann hoped that segregating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied Poland . Normally , those arrested remained in custody for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the East . But before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case , wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the Rosenstrasse address , first in ones and twos , and then in ever-growing numbers . Perhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest , although not all at the same time . Women demanded back their husbands , day after day , for a week . Unarmed , unorganized , and leaderless , they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich . Joseph Goebbels , the Gauleiter ( governor or district leader ) of Berlin , anxious to have that city racially cleansed , was also in charge of the nation 's public morale . On both counts he was worried about the possible repercussions of the women 's actions . Rather than inviting more open dissent by shooting the women down in the streets and fearful of jeopardizing the secrecy of the " Final Solution , " Goebbels with Hitler 's concurrence released the Rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty-five of them who already had been sent to Auschwitz ! To both Hitler and Goebbels , the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable . But they were mistaken . Almost all of those released from Rosenstrasse survived the war . The women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction . ( Adapted from an article posted at the University of South Florida website , " A Teacher 's Guide to the Holocaust . " )  
  I guess if a film has magic , I don't need it to be fluid or seamless . It can skip background information , go too fast in some places , too slow in others , etc . Magic in this film : the scene in the library . There are many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris , yet they don't detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible , the hardest to fix . Both characters are smart . Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read ; he can't read because he 's had too much adventure in his childhood . Iris , although well-educated , hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the U-turn her life took . In both their faults and strengths , the characters compliment each other . It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an Iris would wind up working year after year in a factory , or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job . And while these " mysteries " are explained in the course of the story , their unfolding seems somewhat contrived . I assume no one took the time to rethink the script . Even so , it 's a good moviejust imagine what De Niro , Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had !  
  So wonderful , so quirky , so romantic , so Italian . The film is so feather - light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again . A kitchen sink world of bakeries , and hairdressers , and plumbing , but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence . Should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction ? Take your pick - they 're both faultless . Let me get back to that New York City that lies just beyond the looking glass .  
  This is a movie that should be seen by everyone if you want to see great acting . Mr . Torn and Ms Farrel do an outstanding job . I think they should have it on TV again so a new audience can enjoy it . Wonderful performances . It gives you a real feel of what the pioneers had to go through both physically and emotionally . Great unheard of movie . It was done when Ms . Farrel was very young . I had always thought of her as a comedian , but this certainly is not a comedy and she is just wonderful . There is very little dialogs , but that just make it seem more real . Mr . Torn as always is a great presence and just his breathing has great feeling . I must see movie .  
  A classic series that should be at least repeated or released on DVD . Billy Toth , after realising he is adopted after the death of his parents , embarks on a journey to find his real parents . After various rites of passage , his search culminates in the discovery that his fathers identity was stolen and used by a human trafficker in Europe ! If i remember correctly , the series ends on the Austrian ( ? ] ski slopes and a cliff top chase resulting in the death of Billys fathers betrayer . This series was all filmed on location in various destinations round Europe and appeared polished and incredibly well made with some episodes crossing into the realms of film noir and crime thriller . The main arc was often eclipsed by the slices of life that Billy went through during his years of toiling to find his mother and fathers secrets . A class act but underrated and forgotten .  
  Evening is an entertaining movie with quite some depth . All the actors and actresses turn in spectacular performances . With the tremendous cast , though , one expects stellar acting , but in this movie the expectations are exceeded . One can relate to personalities and situations in ones own family . As one watches the interaction of the family members one 's own family memories are immediately brought to mind . This is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book . Usually it is the other way around ; one reads the book and then wants to see the movie . I will definitely obtain a copy of the Susan Minot book and read it . The Rhode Island scenery is spectacular as is the soundtrack . Any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles . Needless to say now , but I recommend Evening highly . See it you will enjoy it .  
  " Protocol " is a hit-and-miss picture starring Goldie Hawn as a bubbly cocktail waitress who one night saves the life of a visiting Arab from an assassination attempt . The woman immediately becomes a celebrity , and gets a new job working for the U.S. Government . Will the corridors of power in our nation 's capital ever be the same ? Hawn is excellent as usual even though " Protocol " isn't as funny as her best film " Private Benjamin " . But it 's still a good movie , and I did laugh alot . * ( out of four )  
  All Dog 's Go to Heaven is an animated kid 's movie like no other . Gambling , drinking , death , guns and Hell are all prominent in the plot , and though kids will get very little of it , adults will be scratching their heads as to why this movie was made to feel like some sort of gangster movie . The actual movie isn't explicit in any way , it 's just an odd combination to make a kid 's movie on . Charlie Barkin ( Burt Reynolds ) is a player dog , who owns half a casino with his partner Carface ( Vic Tayback ) . After getting drunk ( A dog .. getting drunk .. in a kid 's movie . It just sounds weird . ) , Charlie is tricked and murdered by Carfax . When in heaven , he finds a way to come back to Earth , but he will no longer be allowed in Heaven . He still goes back to Earth and meets up with his old friend Itchy ( Dom Deluise ) , and plans payback on Carfax . Meanwhile , Carfax has a little orphan girl Anne Marie held captive because of her amazing ability to talk to all species of animals , which helps predict races . Charlie and Itchy free her , and try to help her find a family , while learning a lot about themselves . This movie is one of the few non-Disney that will appeal to both kids and adults . Kids will enjoy the funny characters and lively animation , while adults will enjoy the nice , sweet plot , and the more than normal developed characters . One thing that keeps this down , is that it 's a musical . Normally , that 's a good thing , but the music here is honestly terrible . They tend to jump around , almost sounding ad libbed , with next to no instrumental backing . In fact , these are probably the worst songs I 've ever heard in an animated movie , but luckily , the rest of the film is strong enough to not fall apart because of some bad notes . The ending of this movie works , but I honestly hate it . It 's sad , but happy , but more sad than happy , and makes the movie feel like it needs a sequel . Considering how bad the sequel made to this was , I wish the ending wouldn't have warranted a sequel and it would 've wrapped up into a nice , super happy ending . This is one of the few movies I feel this way about , but I do . Overall , this is a nice family film , with odd themes thrown in , but nonetheless , good entertainment . My rating : * out of * . 85 mins . G .  
  I can understand why some people like this movie , and why some people don't . For me , though , I really like it , even if I noticed some good bits , and not so impressive bits . The animation was actually excellent , like Charlie 's dream . The characters were a mixed bag , the best being Anne-Marie , voiced by the late Judith Barsi . ( I was physically ill when I read what happened to her ) Also , Carface is a very convincing villain , especially voiced by the wonderful Vic Tayback ( I particularly loved " Morons I 'm surrounded by Morons " ) and along with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat is probably the most memorable of all the Don Bluth villains . Charlie and Itchy only just lacked the same sparkle , but I loved King Gator and his song . Some of the film is very haunting , like Annabelle 's " You can never come come back " , which kind of scares me still . Unfortunately , there were some bits I didn't like so much . The story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused , but Disney 's Black Cauldron suffered from the same problem . Also there were some dark scenes , that young children would find upsetting , but the ending is very poignant . However the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung . None of them in particular stick out , with exception of " Let 's Make Music Together " and " Love Survives " , and Burt Reynolds can't sing and Dom DeLuise has done much better singing . All in all , a watchable movie , that could have been more , but is definitely memorable , and I would definitely watch it again . 7/10 . Bethany Cox  
  This is one of the greatest movies ever maybe even the greatest movie ever . I had forgotten about the movie for about 12 years . Until I saw an add on TV for ADGTH and it brought back fond memories of me watching it when I was a little kid . And when I watched it a few nights ago I became addicted to the movie . Usually I don't like animated family movies but this one is special it is the perfect family movie . The ending of the movie always touches my heart and saddens me very much but that is what makes this movie amazing better than all of the garbage that is coming out for kid movies today . I mean the movie is G rated and it is about 2 dogs who are involved with gambling , there is a lot of smoking , drinking , murder , death and hell depicted in the movie . Which I Believe makes the movie from good to great . I mean movies today don't bring reality to kids and in this movie they did . RIP Judith Barsi & Dom DeLuise  
  Series 2 has got off to a great start ! I don't think you need to have watched series 1 to get a grasp of whats happening but like any series its nice to feel some sense of the characters and to care about what happens to them . And this show makes you think like that ! These 4 30-something women seem to lead glamorous and exciting lives yet the premise is believable and realistic . So the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are exciting to watch but you also know that these are problems that happen to real women too . Its about the decisions we make as women and how sometimes we are led down certain paths in our lives rather than consciously making those choices !  
  I wasn't quite sure if this was just going to be another one of those idiotic nighttime soap operas that seem to clutter prime time but , as it turns out , this is a pretty good show ( no small thanks to talented casting ) . Four female friends with diverse backgrounds get together and share the weekly goings-on of their love-lives . The hour long program follows each of them separately through their often screwed up quests to find love and it does it without being boring or trite . Sharon Small 's " Trudi " is the homemaker one ( allegedly widowed after September 11th ) who gets a little preachy and annoying with her friends ( who tend to be a little looser and more creative in their endeavors ) . It 's great to see Small back on t . v . , as she was great in the " Inspector Lynley Mysteries " . The chick can act . Orla Brady 's character ( Siobhan , a lawyer ) is perhaps the most damaged but still very sympathetic of the women , as she wrestles with her kind but self-absorbed husband Hari ( Jaffrey , formerly of " Spooks " ) in his driven desire to have a child with her , regardless of her needs . The final two members of the cast are the effervescent Jess ( Shellie Conn ) , an events planner who 's a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone , gender not specific , and Katie , ( Sarah Parrish ) a somber doctor who 's affair with a patient AND his son have sent her career and love life spiraling out of control . That being said , I 'm hooked now and hope that the BBC continues cranking this series out because it 's good , it 's different and it 's got a great cast .  
  Saw this film in August at the 27th Annual National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Milwaukee , WI , it 's first public screening . THE FILM IS GREAT ! Derek Luke is wonderful as Antwone Fisher . This young actor has a very bright future . The real Antwone Fisher did a great job writing the film and Denzel 's direction is right on the money . See it opening weekend . You won't be disappointed .  
  After seeing Arthur on TV numerous times I laughed so hard Dudley Moore 's role as Arthur a happy go luck drunken millionaire was hysterical but John Gielgud as his servant / father figure Hobson was equally charming . I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and watched it , despite the passage of nearly 27 years it 's still as enjoyable as it ever was Liza Minnelli 's role as the love interest was fascinating the chemistry between the two was magic . Arthur Bach , ( Moore ) is a spoiled drunken millionaire who has a bar bill that reads like the national debt he has no desire to grow up and enjoys acting like a child . His activities are supervised by his dry English butler Hobson ( Gielgud ) it appears that nobody really cares about Arthur except for him , Arthur 's father ( Barbour ) offers an ultimatum if he doesn't marry the dreadful blonde socialite Susan Johnson ( Eikenberry ) in four weeks he 'll cut off his son 's inheritance of 750 million dollars . However Arthur meets and falls in love with Linda Marolla ( Minnelli ) a young working class waitress and tie thief , now he faces a difficult decision marry for love or money . When Hobson dies Arthur finally grows up and breaks it off with Susan before the wedding , leaving him to keep both the money and his true love . Arthur is a truly enchanting romantic comedy for for everyone  
  " Show People " is an absolutely delightful silent directed by King Vidor and starring Marion Davies and Billy Haines . What gems both of them are in this charming comedy about a young girl , Peggy Pepper , whose acting is the talk of Savannah trying to make it on the big screen . Though she 's a success in comedy , what she wants to do is make " art " so she moves up to High Arts Studio . Soon she becomes Patricia Pepoire and is too good for the likes of her friend Billy . Many stars of the silent era have cameos in " Show People , " including Davies herself without the curly hair and makeup . I 'm sure when people saw the film in 1928 , they recognized everyone who appeared in the elaborate lunch scene ; sadly , nowadays , it 's not the case , even for film buffs . In one part of the film , however , she does meet Charlie Chaplin ; in another , author Elinor Glyn is pointed out to her , and Vidor himself has a cameo at the end of the film . Other stars who pop up in " Show People " are John Gilbert , Douglas Fairbanks , William S . Hart , Leatrice Joy , Bess Flowers , Renee Adoree , Rod LaRoque , Aileen Pringle , and many others . Davies was adorable and a lively comedienne . It 's a shame William Haines quit the movies - he was cute and energetic , deservedly an enormous star back in the day . " Show People " is a simple story told in a witty way . It 's also a look back at an exciting era in Hollywood 's history and contains performances by two wonderful stars .  
  A tour deforce ! OK the kid that plays Oliver is a bit too sweet ! Starting with the great cinematography , color , costumes and most impressive performances this is a must see movie . I have seen several adaptations of this great novel , but this one stands above them all and its a musical to boot ! It is a masterful Fagan , never leaving his character to do a song . You never really know if you like him or not , the same feeling I got in the book . In other versions you hate him from start to finish . Bill Sykes .. when you read the book hes a mean one , and so he is in this movie . Oliver Reed was masterful . His wife directed this masterpiece . I went and saw his last movie , Gladiator based on his many fine performances , not to see the headliners . The music fits the times and the mood . Who will buy this beautiful movie ? You Should !  
  At this point it seems almost unnecessary to state that Jon Bon Jovi delivers a firm , strong , seamless performance as Derek Bliss . His capability as an actor has been previously established by his critical acclaim garnered in other films ( The Leading Man , No Looking Back ) . But , in case anyone is still wondering , yes , Jon Bon Jovi can act . He can act well and that 's come to be expected of him . It 's easy to separate Derek from the guy who belts out hits on VH-1 . I generally would not watch a horror movie . I 've come to expect them to focus on sensationalistic gore rather than dialogue and plot . What pleased me most about this film was that there really was a viable plot being moved along . The gore is not so much as to become the focus of the film and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of films with higher technical effects budgets . So , gore fans might be disappointed , but story fans will not . Unlike an action film like U-571 where the dialogue takes a back seat to the bombast , we get a chance to know " the good guys " and actually care what happens to them . A few scenes are left unexplained ( like Derek 's hallucinations ) but you get the feeling certain aspects were as they were to lay the foundation for a sequel . Unfortunately , with the lack of interest shown by Hollywood in this film , that sequel will never happen . These few instances are forgiveable knowing that Vampires could have been a continuing series . Is this the best film I 've ever seen in my life ? No . Is it a good way to spend about two hours being entertained ? Yes . It won't leave the person who fears horror movies with insomnia and it won't leave the horror movie lover completely disappointed either . If you 're somewhere in between the horror genre loather and the horror genre lover , this film is for you . It reaches a happy medium with the effects and story balancing each other .  
  The original Vampires ( 1998 ) is one of my favorites . I was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters . I was quite surprised at how this played out . As a rule , sequels are never as good as the original , with a few exceptions . Though this one was not a great movie , the writer did well in keeping the main themes & vampire lore from the first one in tact . Jon Bon Jovi was a drawback initially , but he proved to be a half-way decent Slayer . I doubt anyone could top James Wood 's performance in the first one , though .. unless you bring in Buffy ! All in all , this was a decent watch & I would watch it again . I was left with two questions , though .. what happened to Jack Crow & how did Derek Bliss come to be a slayer ? Guess we 'll just have to leave that to imagination .  
  There wasn't a day in 2002 where i wasn't chased by a scarecrow I felt that this film handled a serious issue well It brought back a lot of memories as it was so realistic Even today I have nightmares about corn on the cob , and can't even go near the tinned stuff in fear of my life I have to admit though , at one point in the film I did have to turn it off as it hit too close to home For those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow , by watching this film you could be educated about how it felt for us victims This film teaches us not to take life for granted or to mess with corn , believe me , I 've been there and I have the scars Watch the film , its amazing and educational  
  First , an explanation : Despite my headline , I 'm giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is NOT one of the best films ever made . All the criticisms registered here have valid points . Also , be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate Neil Simon 's brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter . He does have a distinctively New York ear for dialogue - especially dry , Jewish , love-suffused sarcasm - and if you have trouble accepting sarcasm as an expression of love , then you might have trouble accepting the optimism at the heart of this movie . So much for warnings . Here 's my main point : Walter Matthau is flat-out perfect , even beyond perfect , in this movie . I have never seen him funnier , or more touching for that matter - because at the same time that he shows us the hilariousness of this character who refuses to give up his Big Star self-image or insufferable attitudes even as his coherence is in decline , he also shows us the more vulnerable , maybe even heartbreakingly scared person inside the grouch . And he only barely shows us that sad part - it 's just enough to really get to you if you happen to be coping with your own father 's or husband 's mental decline right now ( I mention this as a warning ) , but artistically , it 's just enough pathos to give this character the most authentically deep roots I 'm seen in possibly any film performance . This is beyond Method acting - Matthau 's performance is exquisite as character work and a pure delight as comic delivery . This is a masterpiece of comic acting . About Richard Benjamin : I personally find his acting annoying in general , and his work in this movie is no exception - although he has some fine moments here . ( " Chicken is funny .. " is one of them . ) So if you like him , you should like him here , and if you don't this movie won't change your mind . About the 1976 Oscars .. I agree that Matthau was unfortunate to be up against Nicholson in " Cuckoo 's Nest " that year . It was a killer year for leading-actor competition ; if only there were separate Oscars for comedy and drama , then I think the Best Actor Oscars would have gone to Al Pacino for " Dog Day Afternoon " and to Walter Matthau for " The Sunshine Boys " - not to dis Jack 's fine work as McMurphy , but I think that Pacino and Matthau were each CLEARLY more masterful and astoundingly effective and downright legendary in their performances than Nicholson was that year . Also , I believe that Burns got the Supporting Actor Oscar more for sentimental reasons than for the quality of his performance - I mean , he was good in this movie , but not THAT good . ( Burns 's fine-as-ever but unexceptional-in-itself return to show biz beat Brad Dourif 's truly brilliant debut in " Cuckoo 's Nest , " not to mention Chris Sarandon 's stunning debut in " Dog Day Afternoon " - which I think proves my theory . ) Oscar theories aside , here 's my bottom line review : If you like Matthau 's comic acting , then see this movie and savor his powerhouse tirades and wonderful grandmother-inspired gestures , fleeting facial expressions and seemingly unscripted asides . ( But if you 're currently dealing with the pain of watching an old person lose his grip , then be warned that this movie might either be the comic relief you need or a dose of reality too painful to watch right now . )  
  I was about thirteen when this movie came out on television . It is far superior in action than most movies since . Martin Sheen is excellent , and though Nick Nolte has a small part , he too provides excellent support . Vic Morrow as the villain is superb . When Sheen " tests the water " in his ' 34 Ford ( COOL ) along the mountainous highway it is spectacular ! The ending is grand . I 'm disappointed in the low vote this received . I figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these days . Good taste eludes the masses !  
  What Irving Thalberg did in making this film today would never be attempted again . Making a Chinese story with occidental players even if they are of the caliber of Paul Muni , Luise Rainer , Charley Grapewin , and Walter Connolly among others . Perhaps it 's partly because the story was written by a westerner , Pearl Buck who got a Pulitzer Prize for her novel in 1932 . Ms . Buck , daughter of Chinese missionaries , probably brought China closer to the consciousness of America than any other person . Not the political struggles of China , but the lives and toil of the every day people we find in The Good Earth . Unfortunately later on , Pearl Buck became an apologist for the Kuomintang China of Chiang Kai-Shek in all its virtues and excesses . The rest of her literary output never matched The Good Earth . In The Sundowners there is a great description of comparing China to Australia by Peter Ustinov . When asked the difference , Ustinov said China was very big and very full and Australia was very big and very empty . That 's what you see in The Good Earth , China very big and very full of people , more than she can deal with at times . The Good Earth tells the story of Wang Lung ( Paul Muni ) as a young man who purchases a wife from a large house where she was a slave . The woman O-Lan ( Luise Rainer ) bears him two sons and sees him through all the good times and bad they have , drought , famine , revolution , and a climatic locust plague . Luise Rainer won the second of two consecutive Oscars for portraying O-Lan . She may have set some kind of record in that it has to be the leading player Oscar performance with the least amount of dialog . Everything she does practically is done with facial expressions , her performance could have been on a silent film with very minimal subtitles . I think only John Mills in Ryan 's Daughter had fewer words and he was playing a mentally retarded man . Muni is not always appreciative of how supportive she is in that male dominated culture . Rainer helps in the field , bears and raises the kids , does the housework . When Muni becomes a man of property he takes a Chinese second trophy wife who causes him a lot of grief . Still Rainer stoically bears it all . Still Muni is not a bad man and it 's a tribute to the film and his acting and Buck 's writing that you don't hate him and the culture gap is bridged . We 've got a group of oriental players now who do more than just Kung Fu movies . I 'm surprised The Good Earth of all films has not been remade at this point . I 'll bet the Chinese government would even let some American company do it on an actual location . Till then we 've got this great classic to appreciate and enjoy .  
  A warm , sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop ( James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan ) who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it . The key to this film 's success is that Ernst Lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low-key , unfussy performances . As a result , you fall in love with virtually all of them . There 's a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which I appreciated . Loneliness is a major theme , most obviously represented in the character of the shop 's owner and manager , played wonderfully by Frank Morgan . He discovers that he 's being cuckolded by his wife , and realizes that the successful life he 's created for himself isn't enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesn't have a partner to share it . This makes the timid romance between Stewart and Sullavan all the more poignant , because they 're both reaching out to this unseen other , who each thinks of as a soulmate before they 've even met . Of course we know everything will turn out right in the end , but the movie doesn't let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didn't live up to the fantasy . Lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry . The little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family , and that 's exactly how it feels to us as well . This is a wonderful , unsung romance . Grade : A +  
  ' The Shop Around the Corner ( 1940 ) ' is a pleasant romantic comedy , not the sort that I will hold dear to me until the end of my days , but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation . By 1940 , director Ernst Lubitsch had long ago taken Hollywood by storm , and his famed " Lubitsch touch " had become a sparkling commercial trademark . This film was planned for a 1939 release , but scheduling conflicts meant that James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan were unavailable for filming . Rather than substituting either of his main stars , Lubitsch decided to postpone production , in the meantime directing Greta Garbo in ' Ninotchka ( 1939 ) . ' When it was finally completed , ' The Shop Around the Corner ' appears to have been met with relative indifference , receiving zero Oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by Samson Raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and Frank Morgan in a supporting role . Time , nevertheless , has betrayed the film 's massive and enduring influence , with high-profile remakes including ' In the Good Old Summertime ( 1949 ) ' and ' You 've Got Mail ( 1998 ) . ' At its surface , one might assume ' The Shop Around the Corner ' to simply be the story of two lovers , Klara Novak ( Sullavan ) and Alfred Kralik ( Stewart ) , who love each other without knowing it . However , Lubitsch 's film runs much deeper than that . It 's the story of Matuschek and Company , a stylish gift shop in Budapest , and the various human relationships that make the store such a close-knit family . When store-owner Hugo Matuschek ( Frank Morgan ) begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife , we witness the breakdown of two families , both at home and at work . There 's absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the United States  perhaps in the blustery streets of New York  but Lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in Europe , the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep . This subtle subtext brings a more meaningful , personal touch to the film  in fact , even as I write this review , I 'm beginning to appreciate the story even more . Sullavan and Stewart are both lovely in their respective roles , but I think that it 's the supporting cast that really make the film . Each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix , and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable . I especially liked how Lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards Hugo Matuschek , who , in any other film , would have been restricted to an underdeveloped , two-dimensional portrayal . Matuschek may have lost the love of his family , but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees , and you feel a heartwarming glow when , in the bitter cold of a Christmas Eve snowstorm , he finds companionship in a freckle-faced young errand-boy ( Charles Smith ) . This genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of Billy Wilder 's later creations , for example , Boom Boom Jackson in ' The Fortune Cookie ( 1966 ) ' or Carlo Carlucci in ' Avanti ! ( 1972 ) . ' Of course , it doesn't really need saying , but Billy Wilder learned from the best .  
  Of the three remakes of this plot , I like them all , I have all three on VHS and in addition have a copy of this one on DVD . There is just enough variation in the scripts to make all three entertaining and re-watchable . In addition has any other film been remade three times with such all star casts in each ? Of course the main stars in this one are great , but the supporting actors are also superb . I particularly like William Tracy as Pepi . He was such a scene stealer that I have searched to find other movies he is in . He appeared in many , but most are not available . As the other comments , I also say - buy this one .  
  Watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line , the excellent character development , and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as a whole . Without giving away too much of the plot , it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons . Along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves . The story has a prologue about what dancing in Japan symbolizes sociologically , so it isn't exactly as simple to learn to dance in Japan as it is here in the U.S. The film is lighthearted ; you 'll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags . Yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe . All of the film 's characters are taken seriously , as they are , and none are diminished because of their " imperfections . " I 've been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends . It just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance . Is this synchronous or what ? I think so because now I 'm really geeked to give it a try . Watch this wonderful family film ( small children might not get it , but teens certainly would ) and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again . Why they would make a remake of Shall We Dance is a mystery , as it is perfect as-is .  
  A real classic , ten out of ten ! Every actor is perfect , the screenplay is a haunting succession of suspenseful scenes . Scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking . Wonder if this film is already out in DVD , because it must be seen in Widescreen version . Saw this film in the late fifties , maybe three or four times , and never since then forgot it . I remember it was one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features , process called Warnerscope which gave a very neat cinematography . Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved an Oscar for their performances . The only thing I could criticize is not having been directed by someone like , say Nicholas Ray , to increase its rhythm and tension .  
  I think I truly love this film . " Prix de Beaute " was originally a silent film but later dubbed into French in 1930 . Despite having someone else 's voice dubbed over hers , this remains a stunning tour de force for Louis Brooks . The fact that her singing voice is dubbed by the legendary Edith Piaf helps to mollify us purists about the dubbing deception . This is the story of Lulu and we first see her at a resort with her macho boyfriend , Andre ( Georges Charlia ) and their friend Antonin ( Augusto Bandini ) . Lulu enters the frame as a pair of legs : we see her inside the car changing into her bathing costume . Lulu is very free with showing off her body and this does not sit well with the irksome Andre . When Lulu considers applying for the title of ' Miss Europe ' we know that a happy ending is not going to be sitting at the end of Easy Street . The film seems to focus a lot on men ogling beautiful women . We see plenty of bathing beauties and the reactions of the men staring at them . But at the center of it all is the magnificent Louise Brooks . If you don't mind watching films from the bygone eras , then consider checking out this one . Louise Brooks is not a name that most average movie buffs may readily know but as soon as you see her you will be mesmerised and you 'll want to know more . Also check her out in ' Pandora 's Box ' if you can find it . Be wary of the US Kino DVD release . I don't know if their projection speed is correct . A lot of the scenes appear to be shown at too fast a speed . This may have been the way they were shot . I don't know . But since it 's the only way to see this film , it 's worth swallowing that one minor bitter pill .  
  This is full of major spoilers , so beware . " Prix de Beaute " always suffers in comparison to the two films Louise Brooks made with G . W . Pabst , " Pandora 's Box " and " Diary of a Lost Girl , " but in some ways , " Prix " is the quintessential Brooks film . Here she has a chance to be charming without the dark side of her Pabst collaboration . What " Prix " has that the Pabst films don't is music . In this early French film , the whole Louise Brooks mystique is fleshed out powerfully with a conjunction of image , song and music . The Charleston is what seems most associated with Brooks ( she was the first to dance it in Europe ) , but the essence of the actress comes across more strongly in the tango . The tango also plays a plot point in " Prix , " being the music she danced with on her short rise to stardom after becoming Miss Europe . Later , when she has forsaken her fame in favor of a mundane existence as the wife of jealous husband Andre , the longing for her forsaken fame becomes apparent when the same tango record is seen on her apartment record player . So appropriate is the tango to Brooks it is used to accompany the documentary about her life , " Looking for Lulu , " a film narrated by Shirley Maclaine . The brazen and forceful quality of the tango epitomizes Louise Brooks ' strong-headed but elegant and erotic individuality . The song , " Je n'ai qu'un amour , c'est toi , " adds an immense amount of pathos to what is not a great film ( but a very good one ) . By the way , Brooks ' voice was not dubbed for the film by Edith Piaf as some have claimed . Piaf was born in 1915 , and wasn't discovered until 1935 . The song , however , is what Brooks ' character , Lucienne , sings to Andre at the beginning of the film to cheer him up and express her deep affection for him . And at the climax it is the song she sings for her screen test , which she views with the producers and managers who intend to shape her career . It continues on screen after husband Andre , who has followed her to the screening room , shoots and kills her . In a single shot , with Lucinenne 's dead body in repose at the bottom of the screen while her screen test continues above with the song she once sang to Andre , the essence of what movies do that other art forms do not is perfectly characterized . As Andre watches his now dead wife sing to him on screen , the murder weapon still smoking , he subtly smiles . She is now his forever , and by association , ours . Coincidentally , Louise Brooks real life career crashed and burned after " Prix de Beaute , " so it was also the death of her final starring roll as well . This film really seals the Brooks mystique more so than the Pabst films ( which are superior films , no doubt ) . It also points out what it is about the movies that create the whole idea of the " cult " of the movies - where people like Brooks , James Dean and Marilyn Monroe live on more intensely after their death than when they were alive .  
  Billy Wilder is co-credited for the story , and his unsentimental touch is noticeable in this quite original tale of ghostwriting songwriters who both work for burnt-out music legend Oliver Courtney . The obvious misunderstandings are gotten out of the way quite quickly , thank heaven , and what remains is a witty and breezy concoction with some fine songs ( and some more forgettable ones ) , Crosby at his most charming , a great turn by Broadway legend Mary Martin and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant providing most of the cynical barbs ( Levant is in rare form and his quips haven't dated at all ) . A delightful surprise , and recommended for all fans of the genre .  
  I enjoyed the story by itself , but the things that I learned about WWI Planes & boats , make this movie a must see . The close-ups on the plane & the torpedo boat & how they were used were completely new to me . I heartily recommend .  
  with very little screen time and money , Dan Katzir manages to do so much . This movie , in its heart-warming simplicity , touches the beauty of love from a fresh angle . rejuvinated lust  
  We tend to forget that the master / slave context of the past centuries lead to more than well-tended estates , powered by large groups of enslaved people , and a lot of money for the white owners . It lead to a group of people caught in the middle - the offspring resulting from slave owners interferring with their female slaves . Some of these children just became more slaves , and others were free .. but free and coloured , which back then meant anything but , relative to the lot of their sires . A class formed around these offspring - the gens de couleur libre or free people of colour - and that class was able , to a certain extent , to own property , raise themselves from downtrodden to educated , and to attain a comparative dignity . That is to say , they weren't slaves , but they were still exploited to a certain extent . Often , the women lived as mistresses to the white plantation masters and men of wealth , set up in their own houses , with allowances , schooling paid for for their children , and a kind of gentility , dependent on the respectability they chose to impose on their families . In essence , they were prostituting themselves to ensure their own prosperity , and relative independence from labour - an arrangement called plaçage . Feast of All Saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one such woman , the result of just such an arrangement with a local gentleman , and the people who touched on their lives , in both a negative and a positive way . The tale was an eye-opener for me , a New Zealander , with no real conception of the black / white lines , let alone that grey area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre trod gingerly . The characters are very three dimensional , and have been well-rendered in this adaption of the novel , by Anne Rice . The parts are well-cast , the costumes are wonderful , and the brutal way the lines are drawn out , with the blurred areas made all the more distinct by the conflicts the protagonists go through . The gens de couleur libre could not marry the whites , the slaves could not help themselves , and the whites , even the sympathetic ones , couldn't bear to face the economic reality of doing right by the people they depended on . I recommend this story , both the novel and the miniseries , to everyone , unreservedly . If you can't handle the truth you 'll cringe and cower through some parts , as one injustice after another is meted out on those of colour , both by their white oppressors , and by their own people . Bear in mind though that this is nothing more than reality , and this tale is an absorbing way to learn about it . I know it may sound callous , but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me , despite the sour taste I found in my mouth at what went on , and I thoroughly enjoyed it . Watch it . If not read up on the period , because there 's a lesson to be learned from it all .  
  I 've been looking for the name of this film for years . I was 14 when I believe it was aired on TV in 1983 . All I can remember was it was about a teenaged girl , alone , having survived a plane crash AND surviving the Amazon . I remember people were looking for her ( family ) and that she knew how to take care of herself-she narrates the story and I vividly remember about her knowing that bugs were under her skin . I don't remember much else about this movie , and want to see it again-if this IS the same one-and if any of you have a copy , could you email me at horsecoach4hire @ hotmail . com ? I 'd be curious to attain a copy to see if it is in fact the same film I remember . It was aired on Thanksgiving ( US ) in 1983 , and I was going through problems of my own and this film really impacted heavily on me . Thanks in advance !  
  I first saw this movie back in the 1980 's and now in 2006 this movie still is one of the best movies I have ever seen ! I would recommend anyone to look at this movie . You will not be sorry . It is well acted out , so real and never a dull moment . The acting is superb and the location makes the movie seem like you are there . From the beginning right up to the end , this movie is the type that makes you lose your attention . The actress does an excellent job of portraying the girl who survived this horrific plane crash in the Amazon and it shows how she managed to survive in the Amazon all alone . It is unbelievable that anyone could survive under such conditions . This is why this movie is so appealing . The fact that this is a true story makes the movie even more interesting and to think that a young girl could survive from this ordeal is overwhelming . I find this movie one that I can watch over and over again and one that I never get tired of . This is indeed quite a compliment as I have hundreds of movies ! I would say this is probably my favorite movie and the best I have ever seen !  
  I thought the whole movie played out beautifully with fresh images and interesting cinematography the whole way through it . The actors were on top of their character 's backs in nearly perfect timing and looked great . The music was lush and well-thought-out . It even had a decent twist of an ending . So what 's with everyone voting it down ? The story wasn't entirely fresh ( felt like a remnant of " Running Man " with the whole television show idea ) , but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about how the public picks their Messiah certainly sounded true enough . It made sense to follow this one man who was put before a modern crowd and to put him on a pedestal because of his opportunity . It 's possible that Christians or other religious people pick this up because the movie has the word " God " in it , but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is to teach a possibility to people who maybe never saw the world like this , especially in the modern world where Christianity has been more and more accepted and forgotten about by some . I gave it a 7/10 stars here on IMDb . I thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original , for the most-part . Check it out if you 're not too offended to see an entertaining film from Madrid , Spain , about possibilities of the coming modern Messiah to a TV near you .  
  Sarafina was a fun movie , and some of the songs were really great . Sarafina was very entertaining . I don't normally like music things like this , but the singing was not lame like it looked like on the box . The movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the Soweto rioting of 1976 . It showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters . Because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience , and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government , who you can not sympathise with . The singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent . The clothing of the students in Sarafina is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from Soweto . They made the movie actually in Soweto , which is why it looks very accurate in many parts . All these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about aparthied . As viewers we must be critical of the way the history of Apartheid was presented . As I said before , you become sympathetic to the students - this makes it potentially less reliable and objective . Also , it changes some of the details from other accounts . In Sarafina it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students . The police and army were very aggressive at Soweto , but this is probably an exaggerated event . The police and army did shoot students , but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this . The fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime . This is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students . The movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about aparthied . The teacher was arrested for being against the government , and the mum goes to work in a white persons house . But there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it or any details about the racist policies and laws . - By George S , Chris and Finlay  
  I saw this movie , and the play , and I have to add that this was the most touching story that I had ever seen . Until I saw this movie I was unaware of how awful life was and probably still is for the South African children and adults that were and are living in that era . It brought tears to my eyes and much sadness to my heart that any human being should have to struggle like that just to stay alive , And to bring the children right out of that area and teach them to act and preform and turn them loose to tell their own story is simply amazing . This simply surpass a five star , I rate it a ten . Thank You Mr . Mbongeni Ngema for such a astonishing story . Although it has been 12 years since this story has been told , it is still one that lays heavy in my heart . If there is a VHS , or DVD out there on the play , Please notify me ASAP . Thank You . PS There was nothing wrong with the kids wanting to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to the attention of other countries in hopes that some one would have a heart and offer assistance .  
  I have not read the novel , or anything other by Kurt Vonnegut , but I am now intending to start . This grips you from the very first frame , and does not let go until the end credits start rolling . Taking you places you don't expect , the plot is interesting throughout . The pacing is spot-on , nothing lasts too long , and this does a perfect job of balancing between unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what we 've seen . It is well-told and well-thought out . I 've never watched a film that I feel I could particularly compare this to . It is intense and exciting , as well as funny and sad . The acting is excellent , Nolte absolutely shines , Goodman again proves that he doesn't have to go for laughs , and Lee and Arkin are spellbinding . I could go on , really .. no role is treated to a less than stellar performance . The editing and cinematography are marvelous , and all of the visuals are great , with a couple of unforgettable and astonishing ones . I am going to go for other movies directed by Keith Gordon , as well as the other two apparently related to this , through the author of the books . There is one scene of sexuality , and a lot disturbing and unsettling content in this . I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it ; it is not pleasant . 8/10  
  American playwright Howard W . Campbell , Jr . ( played with a musty obsolescence by Nick Nolte ) lives happily in Germany with his actress wife , Helga Noth ( Sheryl Lee ) before the beginning of World War II . At the peak of his life , Howard is drafted by an American agent ( John Goodman ) to become a spy on behalf of the Allies ; forewarned of the risks the job holds , Howard has everything to lose , but finds the offer irresistible . Following the death of his wife and the end of the war , Campbell camouflages himself with the anonymity of a solitary life in New York City , which muddies his neuroses even further . The central question ( indeed , a question that has frustrated many critics ) of the movie and Kurt Vonnegut 's source novel is , " is Campbell a hero or a traitor ? " Director Keith Gordon and screenwriter Robert B . Weide offer us clues , but no answer , and this ambiguitythis NOT knowingis what keeps " Mother Night " fresh and interesting throughout . At the beginning of the film , Nolte portrays Campbell as intelligent and confident ; by the end , he 's either scared and uncertain , or scared and COMPLETELY certain of his contribution / debt to humanity for the role he played in the war . Gordon applies a certain icy sheen to the images of the film 's first half , which complement his portrait of the Nazi bourgeoisie and captures Vonnegut 's dramatic side . On the flip side , when Campbell is confined to his lonely New York apartment ( which he affectionately calls " purgatory " ) only to be discovered by a group of Nazis , the humor produced also is purely distinctive of the author , and provides a temporary respite from the dramatic tension that unfolds . The moral ( even spiritual ) paradox " Mother Night " presents doesn't lend itself to simple resolution , and to a degree , should be left ambiguousthe black-and-white scenes of Campbell staring wearily into space as he is imprisoned in Israel suggest an unspoken contemplation we are not made privy toas Campbell is a character whose inner workings we wind up knowing very little about ; the war changes him , coming back to America changes him , and meeting up with the Nazis in New York compels him to prolong the facade of his " act " even further , to the point where he can only stare wearily at an image of himself projected on a wall , spewing anti-Semitic bile . Perhaps that 's the best reaction we could hope for .  
  Reese Witherspoon 's first movie . Loved it . The plot and the acting was top notch . You are emotionally involved with the characters . In my opinion , a must see . After watching this movie you will see why Reese Witherspoon 's acting career has been so successful . The other cast members do a great job also . The movie flows extremely well . There is not a boring moment in the whole picture . The Man in the Moon 's length is just right . As I said earlier , I think this movie was excellent . I have seen it numerous times , and have enjoyed every one of the viewings .  
  It is a pleasure to see such creativity on TV again . This show is poetic , artistic and good fun . The characters relate well and the writing is not bad ( I think it will improve as they get their legs ) . Definitely worth a look . The girls steal the show so far in this series . Chuck is adorable as is Olive . The two aunts are a delight . I sincerely hope they write them into bigger parts as they are magic . Well , that 's all the news that is fit to print . Go make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in an old fashioned way . This is like Dr . Seuss for adults .  
  It 's a great American martial arts movie . The fighting scenes were pretty impressive for American movie made in 90 's . Of course the fighting scenes aren't that good as in Honk Kong movies , actually only few American movies have fighting scenes which are as good as in Honk Kong movies , even nowadays . When you watch American martial arts movie , you are expecting to see less impressive fighting scenes , but still having some nice moves , which can be surprisingly good sometimes , or at least that 's what I 'm expecting from these movies . I was impressed by this film . Some fighting scenes were really impressive , the acting , direction and the plot were good enough , so it 's a really worth watching movie , if you like American martial arts films of the 90 's .  
  The H.G. Wells Classic has had several Incarnations . The 05 ' Speilburg Version and the classic 53 ' version But only this one stays completely true to the book . Nothing is changed nothing is removed . Originally Released as a 3-hour film . The director Re-Cut the film down to 2-hours of pure excellence . Its got a chapter by chapter visualization of the novels pages that " Wells would be Proud Of " The story is as everyone remembers . Martians Invade the Earth with Capsules containing an army of Tripod walking War Machines . The people of 19th century earth are ill-prepared to repel the alien forces and fight back with canons and guns who mes shells bound right off the Walkers and when humanity is no longer a world wide power they are saved by the smallest of organisms on earth . The Film is an excellent accomplishment for director Timothy Hines who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a meager 5 Million budget . Today B-Movies have larger budgets .  
  yeah , it 's a bit of a silly film , so if you are looking for an oscar performance , forget this one .. but , if you love John Candy 's humor , this is a must-see . We lost John Candy before he made enough of his great brand of comedy , and he is only better in one movie : Planes , Trains , & Automobiles ( with Steve Martin ) . Excellent supporting performance by Eugene Levy , perhaps his best work ever as the hot-headed Sal DiPasquale . Also good acting by Richard Libertini , Alley Mills & Pat Hingle . You must see this obscure and out-of-print film if you are a John Candy or Eugene Levy fan .  
  If you enjoy the subtle ( yes , I said subtle ) actions and reactions of John Candy , you can't help but like this film ( pronounced " fillum " by Salvatore DiPasquale ) . The unobservant ( and uninformed ) watcher always saw Candy as a broad actor - a big buffoon . And sometimes he was ( see " Stripes " and " Splash " ) . But , when given the opportunity , he could really be razor-sharp and quite subtle . It 's too bad he was cast in so many roles that only showed his broad side , because we 'll never get to see more of the other . Oh , yeah , the movie . One can watch " Going Berserk " over and over ( I know I have ) with the frequency of " Caddyshack . " It 's just that good . The plot , although a little convoluted , is actually fairly deep for a farce of this kind . It allows Candy and the always under-rated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy to bounce off of Candy .. and they bounce HARD . Definitely worth a glance for anyone who enjoyed SCTV or Candy 's other work .  
  You should not take what I am about to say lightly . I 've seen many , many films and have reviewed a great deal of them , in print . So when I tell you that this film has the single funniest scene I have ever seen in a movie , you might want to listen to me . There 's a lot of diversity of opinion as to what makes this INCREDIBLY stupid movie as funny as it is . And to those who just didn't get , well , I can't blame them , too much . The scene I speak of , comes at about the 30 minute mark and involves a dead convict shackled to John Candy . Up until that point , I had found the film dumb , confusing and it was beginning to lose me . When this scene came up , I laughed so hard , I peed my pants . No movie has ever done that to me before . When the project began , " Going Berserk " was supposed to be the SCTV movie . I remember it being announced . As time went on , the cast was whittled down To John Candy , Joe Flaherty & Eugene Levy . There also must have been a regime change at Universal , while it was being shot , because upon being released , it was shown in nearly ZERO theaters . When watching this a second time , I listened to the theme song ( which actually flaunts how incomprehensible the plot is , in the lyrics ) , relaxed my logic nerve and figured out what was going on . Aside from the aforementioned routine , " Going Berserk " has many other hilarious scenes to recommend it . This is almost a 3 Stooges flick , except it 's much funnier . Director David Steinberg has razor sharp timing , and he must have been laughing all through this . As for Candy , who 's basically in charge here , he has NEVER been funnier . With all the plot devices and explanatory scenes thrown out the window , he absolutely runs wild . Flaherty and Levy follow him effortlessly . There is a plot , but it 's a plot like " Animal House " had a plot , and yeah , the script is uneven , and a little slow to start . Once you know this , however , you can well appreciate the full SCTV style craziness that transpires . It IS stupid , but it 's stupid on purpose , and you need to remember that when you see it . DO see it , and discover for yourself , if it has the funniest scene of all time in it .  
  What an ambitious project Kenneth Branagh undertook here and how well it was realized ! This is the first filmed version of ' Hamlet ' to use the full text of Shakespeare 's play , but Branagh didn't do it just because " it was there . " His intention , I believe , was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down , so to speak . In return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves , a fair enough proposition and one that 's a bargain . The setting is a generic 19th century European one and this does more than work well , it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself . The production design and cinematography and both outstanding , which helps immensely when you 're watching a four-hour movie . Branagh 's casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise . The direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play . Since so much of ' Hamlet ' is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels , battles , etc . , this can be a daunting task . But everything Branagh tries to do seems to work . Branagh has always been one of the most interesting actor / writer / directors , if not always the best , since he made his big splash with ' Henry V . ' One quibble I had with him was what I saw as a tendency to ham it up at times . In his portrayal of Hamlet here he might be accused of that again , but there is a method at work . Let 's face it , ' Hamlet ' is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before , he or she needs help even if they 've read the play . Hamlet has the most lines of any Shakespearian character and Branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film , even if you don't know the literal meaning of every arcane word . This performance by Branagh was at the very least worthy of an Oscar nomination . There are so many other outstanding performances here they 're almost too numerous to mention , but some of them must be acknowledged . Derek Jacobi as Claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to Kate Winslet when it comes to handing out praise . Her portrayal of Ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling , made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time ! She looks to me like the finest young actress around . Other super performers in no particular order are Richard Briers , Nicholas Farrell , Michael Maloney , and Reece Dinsdale and Timothy Spall as Guildenstern and Rosencrantz , respectively . Honorable mention goes to Julie Christie , Charlton Heston , and Robin Williams , who manages to do his thing here successfully . Even Billy Crystal as a gravedigger works . The one cast member who doesn't , inexplicably , is Jack Lemmon . In the very opening scene he appears , and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood , Lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor . You know this must have been a real dilemma for Branagh , since everything else about the movies screams out that it 's the work of a perfectionist . Not to be facetious when speaking of a four-hour movie , but it does seem just a tad too long . Some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit , if I may be so bold , and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcome . Did I forget anything , other than Patrick Doyle 's score ? No doubt I did . I 'll just sum up by saying that Kenneth Branagh may have made the definitive film version of ' Hamlet , ' and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one .  
  Budget limitations , time restrictions , shooting a script and then cutting it , cutting it , cutting it .. This crew is a group of good , young filmmakers ; thoughtful in this script - yes , allegorical - clever in zero-dollar effects when time and knowledge is all you have , relying on actors and friends and kind others for their time , devotion , locations ; and getting a first feature in the can , a 1-in-1000 thing . These guys make films . Good ones . Check out their shorts collection " Heartland Horrors " and see the development . And I can vouch , working with them is about the most fun thing you 'll do in the business . I 'm stymied by harsh , insulting criticism for this film , wondering if one reviewer even heard one word of dialogue , pondered one thought or concept , or if all that was desired of this work was the visual gore of bashing and slashing to satisfy some mindless view of what horror should mean to an audience . Let " The Empty Acre " bring itself to you . Don't preconceive what you expect it should be just because it gets put in the horror / thriller genre due to its supernatural premise . It 's a drama with depth beyond how far you can stick a blade into someone with a reverence for a message that doesn't assault your brain 's visual center , but rather , draws upon one 's empathetic imagination to experience other 's suffering of mind and spirit . mark ridgway , Curtis , " The Empty Acre "  
  I went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession . I just wanted to check it out . I was not expecting much of anything . After all , a musician , an actor and a screenplay writer ? Not possible for so much talent to reside in one person . Right ? Wrong ! Obsession aside , it quickly became one of my favorites ! The story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up Hollywood special effects . The story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along . As the credits roll by , you suddenly realize you were glued until the end . At times , the acting seems a little over the top . I do , however , believe it 's done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character . Otherwise , I wouldn't have expected the level of acting witnessed . It 's worth seeing more than once . I find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something I either missed or forgot about the first time or two around . I completely recommend this movie . Feel free to go in with your doubts , but I 'm sure it will find a place on your shelf .  
  Despite what others had said ( * cough * ) , this is my favourite movie of all time . I don't know how long I had been waiting to see it , but once I finally did , I immediately fell in love . Sure , it 's strange , but that just gives it more of an exciting flavour . For those who don't know , Moonchild is one of Gackt and Hyde 's first movies . They haven't done very many at all , maybe 3 or 4 tops each . So , give them some credit . We all know that Adam Sandler wasn't the best at first either . I do believe that they do throw some odd situations in there , but I over look that to find the best points of this movie , the emotions displayed and whatnot . Therefore , I have given , and always shall give , this movie a 10 out of 10 .  
  This is what I call a " pre Sci Fi ; Sci Fi " movie . It gets no better than Lugosi / Karloff in this incredibly good " mood " type motion picture . These two genuine artists are at their very best , as is the story line . Karloff does an amazing job as a scientist that sees himself caught in a vise of vanity , pride , and scientific competition . I was caught up in the idea of watching a man as he drowns himself in the three previously mentioned concepts . I was saddened and at the same time fascinated with the two stars as they do themselves in . This is the sort of motion picture that begs for a remake . This time put Harrison Ford in the Karloff part and maybe Kieffer Sutherland as the Bela Lagosi role . It might be possible to do it almost as good . This is one of the very best that Hollywood EVER produced . As I said .. it gets no better . No way .  
  Brilliant adaptation of the largely interior monologues of Leopold Bloom , Stephen Dedalus , and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick in recreating the endearing portrait of Dublin on June 16 , 1904 - Bloomsday - a day to be celebrated - double entendre intended ! Bravo director Strick , screenwriter Haines , as well as casting director and cinematographer in creating this masterpiece . Gunter Grass ' novel , The Tin Drum filmed by Volker Schlöndorff ( 1979 ) is another fine film adaptation of interior monologue which I favorably compare with Strick 's film . While there are clearly recognized Dublin landmarks in the original novel and in the film , there are also recognizable characters , although with different names in the novel . For example , Buck Mulligan with whom Dedalus lives turns out to be a then prominent Dublin surgeon . This film for all of its excellence is made even richer by additional viewings .

  .. This isn't the first time Stanley blurred the distinction between genres to such great effect , either . In Dr . Strangelove you had a comedy about a horrific situation , and here the basis is a terrifying scenario which actually yields some very funny moments . Slow-burning madness and attempting to kill one 's family isn't hilarious of course , but the dialogue is very knowing ( " five months of peace is just what I want .. " ) and there is a terrific drinking scene which would be riotous if you included just one type of spirit , but is spine-chilling when you factor in the other . I disagree with those who say that the hotel has a negligible effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version . The cues Nicholson provides the audience as an actor merely hint at the potential for madness , which is only reinforced when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son . The environment that he is in , however , then absorbs those personality defects and unleashes them upon his consciousness . In much the same way as buildings are sometimes thought to soak up events that happen there , the hotel feeds on the frailties of a troubled but sane man , and uses his weaknesses against him to eventually take him beyond the point of no return . He may have dormant flaws in his personality before he arrives , but to me the Overlook itself is the trigger that sets them off . Kubrick 's cold and detached approach to directing works splendidly for a chilly horror film , and the unpredictable force of nature that is Jack Nicholson teeters all the time between making you giggle and scaring the wits out of you . When he explodes , you won't be sure how far he can go . Together they made a great team and with a blend of their talents gave us a classic . If you want a great viewing experience , then this is an example that well and truly shines ..  
  The Shining , you know what 's weird about this movie ? This is the movie that everyone , for people who claim to not like horror films , will always say that The Shining is a terrific film . This is Stanley Kubrick 's classic vision of Stephen King 's horror tale of madness and blood . This is just an incredible film and wither you have seen it or not , you have heard of it , know a few lines from it , and know some of the classic images . Who could forget Jack 's " Here 's Johnny ! " ? Who could forget " All Work and No Play Make Jack a Dull Boy " ? Who could forget that chilling ending ? This is the film that is unforgettable and honestly in my opinion is Kubrick 's best work . I know there is a lot of argument in that department , a lot of people say it 's 2001 : A Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange or even Dr . Strangelove , but if those film pioneered film making , then The Shining perfected it . This is the tale of isolation , madness , terrifying images , and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl underneath your skin . Jack Torrance , Jack 's son Danny , and Jack 's wife , Wendy arrive at the Overlook Hotel on closing day . The elderly African-American chef , Dick Hallorann , surprises Danny by speaking to him telepathically and offering him some ice cream . He explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift ; they called the communication " shining . " Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel , particularly Room 237 . Dick tells Danny that the hotel has a certain " shine " to it and many memories , not all of them good , and advises him to stay out of room 237 under all circumstances . Danny 's curiosity about Room 237 finally gets the better of him when he sees the room has been opened . Danny shows up injured and visibly traumatized after Jack tells Wendy that he loves his family . Seeing this , Wendy thinks Jack has been abusing Danny . Jack wanders into the hotel 's Gold Room where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd . Danny starts calling out the word " redrum " frantically , and scribbling it on walls . He goes into a trance , and withdraws ; he now says that he is Tony , his own " imaginary friend . " Jack sabotages the hotel radio , cutting off communication from the outside world , but Hallorann has received Danny 's telepathic cry for help and is on his way . Wendy discovers that Jack has been typing endless pages of manuscript repeating " All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy " formatted in various ways . Horrified , Jack threatens her and she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat , locking him in a storage locker in the kitchen . Jack converses with Grady through the door of the locker , which then unlocks releasing him . Danny has written " REDRUM " in lipstick on the door of Wendy 's bedroom . When she looks in the mirror , she sees that it is " Murder " spelled backwards . Jack picks up an axe and begins to chop through the door leading to his family 's living quarters . " Here 's Johnny ! " , and Jack 's legendary image is born . The Shining is one of those films that you seriously have to make time to see , this is an incredible film and still gives me nightmares . Jack Nicholson 's performance is timeless and unforgettable . But one I also feel is extremely overlooked is Shelley Duvall , her scene of finding Jack 's rant All Work is incredible , that 's a look of horror and you can see that fear in her face after realizing her husband is mad . Also another incredible scene is when Jack sees a ghost woman in the bathtub , it 's honestly one of the most terrifying scenes in horror cinema . The reason this film is so well known is because it 's a film of perfection , it 's been on The Simpsons , it 's been shown in other films and it 's a film that will forever stay with you when you see it , trust me . 10/10  
  This film takes you on one family 's impossible journey , and makes you feel every step of their odyssey . Beautifully acted and photographed , heartbreakingly real . Its last line , with its wistful hope , is one of the more powerful in memory .  
  * SPOILER ! * i saw this gr8 film a few years back , its a lovely story about a young fella who wants to drink his mothers milk at the breast but she thinks he is to old for it . he ends up lusting after another ladies breasts and ends up in competition with his brother who fancies her . throw in a jealous husband of this woman who cannot get " aroused " and you have a cheeky yet warm story about love , friendship and lovely pairs of jugs hehe its brilliant dont be put off by sub-tit-les hehe !  
  I liked the movie a real lot . Wanted to see it just for Dara Tomanovich , but the plot and story were ok too . A very cool change in plot when you least expect it .  
  I can't remember many details about the show , but i remember how passionate i was about it and how i was determined not to miss any episodes . Unfortunately at the time we had no VCR , so i haven't ever seen the series again . However i can remember strongly how i felt while watching it and how thrilled i was every time it came on . Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor these days ( i think i was almost in love ) and he remains one of my favorite actors to the day , mostly due to his appearance in the series . I would gladly buy / steal / download this series , i think i would go to great lengths in order to see it again and revisit a childhood long gone .. Any ideas ? Does anybody knows of a site devoted to the series or has the episodes on tape from their first airing ?  
  A good picture is worth all the words . This film has the most poetic scene ever dreamed of about people with Down 's syndrome . And I won't spoil it by telling you . You 'll want to see it yourself . Pasqual Duquenne is an amazing actor . I did not need to understand a single word he said to understand his meaning . The film has a magic of it 's own . After watching it I understood better that we put too much value on achievement and not enough on the people we love . Passion and simplicity is all we need .  
  If you would like to see a film of different kind , if you feel the Love in your heart , even if you miss the Lord , this film makes you think . Although Georges is mentally handicapped , you can see the ultimate intelligence at the end , when love gives you directions not the brain . I am not emotional , but this film makes you feel the human being . The film is as good as Forrest Gump in my belief . The foreign movies are sometimes more interesting , yet there is not enough advertisement to make them popular . " Rang-e khoda " ( The Color of The God ) by Majid Majidi is another example of such foreign movies , almost with similar taste .  
  I saw this film first on my way home from Paris to Newark aboard Air France in August 1996 . The film itself I believe is quite a masterpiece . It 's the kind of film that people should be making . I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around . In this French film , he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his zest for life until he across a Down Syndrome man who lives in an institution with other Down Syndrome patients . The actors including the actor who actually has Down Syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men . Daniel 's life and ours changes forever with the Down Syndrome man . He realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living and loving and that 's what life should be all about . The ending is kind of silly though but I still think it 's one of my favorite movies . It 's enough to bring a tear to your eye .  
  To me movies and acting is all about telling a story . The story of David and Bethsheba is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account . In this movie I thought the storytelling by Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward were at their best . To know and understand the story of David and his journey to become the King of Israel , made this story all the more compelling . You could feel his lust for a beautiful woman , Gregory Peck showed the real human side of this man who in his time was larger than life . Susan Hayward 's fear , reluctance , but then obedience to his authority as her King was beautifully portrayed by her . One could also feel David 's anguish the nigh that Uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home . As well as the sadness when he was killed in battle . Raymond Massey 's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the King made me feel his anger . The sets were real enough , and the atmosphere believable . All in all I think this was one of the best movies of it 's kind . I gave it a rating of ten .  
  Nagra comes from conservative Indian family that isn't exactly into girls playing competitive soccer . But our attractive young star CAN play some serious soccer . Rhys-Meyers coaches Nagra and encourages her to perform , while Knightley is supportive teammate and friend . When sis ' wedding is scheduled for the same day as the ultimate soccer match , what 's a girl to do ? Similar in its own unique way to BFGW as Nagra tries to push the envelope on traditional family ways . Here it 's dad ( well-played by Kher ) who can see both sides of the issue . Docked an entire point for a hokey late sexual preference non-crisis , if they needed filler they could have gone elsewhere . Nice final wrap up to the whole deal .  
  As an anti-football person , I ( on the surface ) grudgingly took my younger brother to see this film , although secretly I hoped it might be East is East II . The trailers looked fun so I thought I 'd give it a go . It took about ten minutes but after that I was glued to the screen , and that wasn't anything to do with the neck cramp caused by sitting too near the front due to a packed auditorium . The acting was fresh and vibrant , the characters engaging , and the jokes genuinely funny . The entire auditorium was laughing out loud every minute or so . Football fan or no football fan , sport became irrelevant to the main principles of love , friendship , family , independence and rivalry . Add a dash of Sikh culture and you have the formula for the best British comedy I 've seen in a long time , dare I say it .. better than East is East . This film trots along nicely at a lovely pace , never dwelling on anything longer than necessary nor leaving anything unfinished , keeping the viewer entertained and mentally engaged . Though not a characteristically twisting-and-turning film , there are some pleasant surprises on the way and things don't always happen as you would expect . Saying that , there were elements of predictability but these were exploited satirically more than used as script-fillers . I suppose depending on your particular penchant for happy-endings you could be either delighted / let down by the ending . Personally , if there was any other outcome I would have written a strongly worded letter to the script writers . As for the actors , I would have to say that Juliet Stevenson ( Paula ) put in the finest performance . I never knew that people like that existed but she her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts has convinced me that they possibly do ! Prize for the most unconvincing ( of the main characters ) goes , unfortunately , to Kiera Knightley ( Jules ) , but don't get me wrong , even she offered a great performance , it 's just that someone has to be last of the best and sorry Kiera , this time you 're it . Tip : Don't leave before the credits . Once the lights came back up I realised to my horror that perhaps I shouldn't have watched this film after all . My beloved but forgotten Ice Junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice . Oh , what am I saying , it was absolutely brill and I can't recommend it enough . I will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my collection of 3 videos . I 'm a student . I only splash out if it 's really worth it .  
  Silverlake Life , The view from here , is an absolutely stunning movie about AIDS as well as about a gay love relationship . Some images are indeed really hard to take , especially when one is gay or fears about AIDS , and probably for any sensitive person watching it . It 's not easy to make a movie about such a terrible illness and its consequences about not only one , but two people 's lives . This movie teaches how to care for each other in such hard times , but it never gets too morbid , it still shows life at any time , reminding you that outside of the theater or of your room , life goes on , whatever the destiny of some people may be . The characters are incredibly endearing , while we watch their intimacy in shots that never go beyond a very strict limit , never unveiling anything too private or offensive . Children should certainly not watch this movie , but grown-ups whether they have to deal with such situations or not , should do it , and will not regret the tears they shed .  
  I stumbled onto this movie when I was eBay'ing Caesars Palace stuff , as I 'm enamoured with its rich Vegas history as the last of the original luxury resorts still standing in good condition ( unless you count Bally 's , the original MGM Grand ) . In that respect , this movie delivers full-force . You 're given a grand tour of the Caesars property , which in spite of all the renovations and additions they 've done over the 40 years it 's been open , looks alarmingly similar . As a film overall , the plot is somewhat difficult to follow , thanks in large part to the horrendous editing . And when I say horrendous , I 'm not using that word lightly . There 's a lot of spliced-in , second-long snippets of Vegas traffic , casino crowds , and even a scene where the Robert Drivas character is having a conversation with his father about how much he 's grown up , and without any explanation , he ( Drivas ) goes ( in those infamous snippets ) from being himself , to a baby , to a little boy , and then back to himself while talking back and forth with his father . ( That doesn't give away any plot details ; if anything , one can be prepared for it and maybe they won't be as flabbergasted as I was by the editing . ) The film has aged well otherwise , and has a good message about the inherent differences between a father and his son that most guys could relate to in some form or fashion .  
  Bored and unhappy young babe Zandalee ( a winningly sultry and vibrant performance by luscious brunette knockout Erika Anderson ) feels trapped in a stale and loveless marriage to failed poet and decent , yet dull businessman Thierry Martin ( a solid and credible portrayal by Judge Reinhold ) . Zandalee has a torrid adulterous fling with sleazy and arrogant artist Johnny Collins ( deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Nicolas Cage ) . Can the relationship between Thierry and Zandalee be salvaged ? Or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed ? Director Sam Pillsbury and screenwriter Mari Kornhauser lay on the tawdry soap opera-style histrionics something thick while attempting to tell a wannabe serious and insightful story about desire run amok and its potentially dangerous consequences ; the plot goes gloriously off the rails in the laughably histrionic last third . The dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar ( sample line : " I wanna shake you naked and eat you alive " ) . Better still , this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity ( the gorgeously statuesque Anderson looks smoking hot in the buff ) and sizzling semi-pornographic soft-core sex scenes ( Johnny and Zandalee doing the dirty deed in a church confessional booth rates as a definite steamy highlight ) . The tart'n'tangy New Orleans setting adds extra spice to the already steamy proceedings . With his long , scruffy black hair , greasy mustache , foul mouth , and coarse manners , Cage 's Johnny is an absolute hoot as the single most grossly unappealing " romantic " lead to ever ooze his way onto celluloid . The cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity : Anderson , Cage and Reinhold all do respectable work with their parts , with fine support from Joe Pantoliano as Zandalee 's merry flamboyant homosexual friend Gerri , Viveca Lindfors as Theirry 's wise , perceptive mother Tatta , Aaron Neville as friendly bartender Jack , and Steve Buscemi as a funny , blithely shameless thief . Walt Lloyd 's sharp and gleaming cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look . The flavorsome , harmonic score by Pray for Rain likewise hits the spot . A delightfully campy and seamy riot .  
  I just saw a press screening of this film and I was pleasantly surprised . Not often is it that I get to see all of my favorite actors in one film at one time . I really enjoyed the pick pocket scene and it was good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden back together . I think their chemistry on camera is a direct result of their time together off camera . My favorite scene was by far ( surprisingly so ) Bret Ratner 's piece .. Without giving too much away , I 'll just say that there is a surprise that leaves you hanging .. The old couple were really good together and you actually got the impression that they had spent a lifetime together . Both the Chris Cooper and the Ethan Hawke segments packed a punch with surprises that seem realistic and similar to experiences that I 've had in the big apple . Over all the film is a great place to take a date .. especially if you 're already fond of the city itself . I can't wait for the next in the Cities of Love .  
  Bogdonovich 's ( mostly ) unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other . A film that has the feel of a fairy tale , but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic Manhattan locations and " true " geography , perhaps the best location filming in NYC I 've ever seen . John Ritter reminds us that with good directors ( Bogdanovich , Blake Edwards , Billy Bob ) he can be brilliant , and the entire ensemble is a group you 'll wish truly existed so you could spend time with ` em . One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesn't seem to be a rip-off of something else , this is the high point of Bogdanovich 's fertile after - " success " career , when his best work was truly done ( " saint jack " , " at long last .. " , " noises off " .  
  The whole point of making this film , one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera , was to make it more accessible to the masses . And it succeeded admirably in doing so . The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly . Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals ( a young Loren , handsome Della Marra , and a slinky Ms . Maxwell ) who make the story much more believable , giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be . Altogether , an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi 's great works . I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera , a form with which I was then not well acquainted . I still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals . Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames , and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films .  
  Frank McCarthy who produced the Academy Award winning biographical film Patton follows it up with a strong tribute to another of America 's fighting generals , Douglas MacArthur . Gregory Peck gives a strong characterization of the man , his genius as well as his egotism . With MacArthur you never knew quite where one began and the other left off and too many times they blended . The whole story of Douglas MacArthur would be a six hour film or a TV mini-series . It would cover him from his days on frontier posts with his family to his time at West Point where he still has the highest scholastic average ever achieved by a cadet . It would talk about his service in the Phillipines as a young officer , his legend building bravery on the battlefields of World War I in France . It would also have to tell about him firing on the Bonus Marchers of World War I veterans in 1932 , probably putting the final kabosh on any chances President Herbert Hoover had of getting re-elected . During MacArthur 's last years he and Hoover had penthouse suites at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City . That must have been a subject they avoided . This film concentrates on the years 1941 to 1952 and it is told in flashback . The film opens with MacArthur addressing the student body in 1962 . As he speaks the words of the famous Duty Honor Country speech , MacArthur 's mind goes back to World War II and his desperate struggle against the advancing Japanese on the island of Corregidor and the fields of Bataan on Luzon . The film takes him through his struggle to win back the Phillipines , the occupation of Japan and the first 18 months culminating in his relief of command by President Truman . MacArthur as a film would not work at all if it wasn't for the portrayals of Dan O'Herlihy and Ed Flanders as Presidents Franklin D . Roosevelt and Harry S . Truman respectively . It 's the part of the film I enjoyed the best , seeing MacArthur and his relations with both these men . FDR by O'Herlihy captures the aristocratic squire and exceptionally devious man that was our 32nd President . Roosevelt was a man who got his points across with unusual subtlety and cleverness . Sometimes he liked scheming a little too much for its own sake , but he was the master politician of the last century . Note how he deals with MacArthur both as a battlefield commander and potential rival at the same time . Truman by Flanders is as people remember him , a blunt spoken man of the people who disliked MacArthur 's haughtiness from the gitgo . Of course it 's in the history books how Truman relieved MacArthur in 1951 for insubordination . MacArthur was insubordinate , no doubt about it . Yet I could write a whole thesis on the Truman-MacArthur relations . Along the way it need not have ever come to a crisis . I 've always felt that FDR would have dealt with the whole matter in a far better way had he still been president then . MacArthur was also grandly eloquent and Gregory Peck captures some of that eloquence in some of the orations that made him as much a legend as victories on the battlefield . Listen to Peck at the Japanese surrender , at MacArthur 's farewell to the nation before the joint session of Congress , and of course his speech to the cadets in 1962 . Watch the newsreels and see if you don't agree .  
  The effects of job related stress and the pressures born of a moral dilemma that pits conscience against the obligations of a family business ( albeit a unique one ) all brought to a head by - or perhaps the catalyst of - a midlife crisis , are examined in the dark and absorbing drama , ` Panic , ' written and directed by Henry Bromell , and starring William H . Macy and Donald Sutherland . It 's a telling look at how indecision and denial can bring about the internal strife and misery that ultimately leads to apathy and that moment of truth when the conflict must , of necessity , at last be resolved . Alex ( Macy ) is tired ; he has a loving wife , Martha ( Tracey Ullman ) , a precocious six-year-old son , Sammy ( David Dorfman ) , a mail order business he runs out of the house , as well as his main source of income , the ` family ' business he shares with his father , Michael ( Sutherland ) , and his mother , Deidre ( Barbara Bain ) . But he 's empty ; years of plying this particular trade have left him numb and detached , putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist , Dr . Josh Parks ( John Ritter ) . And to make matters worse ( or maybe better , depending upon perspective ) , in Dr . Parks ' waiting room he meets a young woman , Sarah Cassidy ( Neve Campbell ) , whose presence alone makes him feel alive for the first time since he can remember . She quickly becomes another brick in the wall of the moral conflict his job has visited upon him , as in the days after their meeting he simply cannot stop thinking about her . His whole life , it seems , has become a ` situation '- one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully extirpate himself without hurting the ones he loves . He can deny his age and the fact that he has , indeed , slipped into a genuine midlife crisis , but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own . He 's at a crossroads , and he 's going to have to decide which way to go . And he 's going to have to do it very soon . From a concept that is intrinsically interesting , Bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive , and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what Alex is going through . He makes it very clear that there are no simple answers , that in real life there is no easy way out . His characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and , moreover , within any given family unit . The film resoundingly implies that the sins of the father are irrefutably passed on to the progeny , with irrevocable consequences and effects . When you 're growing up , you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large ; and often it is years into adulthood that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral parameters established by every individual who walks upon the planet , and that the ones set by the father may not be conducive to the tenets of the son . And it is at that point that Alex finds himself as the story unfolds ; ergo , the midlife crisis , or more specifically , the crisis of conscience from which he cannot escape . It 's a powerful message , succinctly and subtly conveyed by Bromell , with the help of some outstanding performances from his actors . For some time , William H . Macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business , creating such diverse characters as Quiz Kid Donnie Smith in ` Magnolia , ' The Shoveler in ` Mystery Men ' and Jerry Lundegaard in ` Fargo . ' And that 's just a sampling of his many achievements . At one point in this film , Sarah mentions Alex 's ` sad eyes , ' and it 's a very telling comment , as therein lies the strength of Macy 's performance here , his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated , believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing . Consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed , staring off into the darkness ; in that one restless moment it is clear that he is grappling , not only with his immediate situation , but with everything in his life that has brought him , finally , to this point . In that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt , confusion and uncertainty , all of which have been successfully suppressed until now ; all the things that have always been at the core of Alex 's life , only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing , demanding confrontation and resolution . It 's a complex character created and delivered by Macy with an absolute precision that makes Alex truly memorable . It 's a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly insurmountable odds will be able to relate . It 's a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors around . Sutherland is extremely effective , as well ; his Michael is despicably sinister in a way that is so real it 's chilling . It 's frightening , in fact , to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth . This is not some pulp fiction or James Bond type villain , but a true personification of evil , hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door , which is what makes it all the more disconcerting . And Sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly , with a great performance . Neve Campbell looks the part of Sarah , but her performance ( as is the usual case with her ) seems somewhat pretentious , although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film . If only she would occasionally turn her energies inward , it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters . ` Panic , ' however , is one of her best efforts ; a powerful film that , in the end , is a journey well worth taking . 9/10 .  
  Oh man , why ? " Six Degrees " is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone . If focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions . When I first heard of this show , it didn't caught my attention at all . It seemed too ordinary , actually . Then , i saw some episodes .. and loved it ! First of all , the characters . They are all well-written and different from each other . There 's a alcohol addicted , a woman whose fiancée cheats on her , a woman who just lost her husband , a driver who has a troubled brother and so on .. Unlike what we 're used to , most of the characters interact with each other in casualties , like in our daily routines . Great ! My favourite ones are Mae , Carlos and Whitney . Then , the cast . They are all great . Jay Hernandez , from " Hostel " , shows here his acting habilities in a more 3d character than his previous work as Paxton . The other ones give great performances too , specially Campbell Scott , who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan , who plays Whitney . Well when i came to IMDb , after watching some episodes , i couldn't believe that it got cancelled . Seriously , i can't understand the low ratings . It 's too bad it didn't have more than one season . It would really be a good show to follow !  
  Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands , trying to make sense of what he 's just done . Meanwhile , a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency 's response to what 's just happened on screen . An American flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot , but as he speaks , it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory , as if it doesn't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security . This shot effectively captures the mood of the film . As well as portraying Bourne 's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne , Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security . It is also probably the best film you 'll see in the cinema this year . It 's just so intense . Bourne says to Simon Ross ( Considine ) " This isn't some newspaper story , this is real " and in the audience you almost believe him . The camera shakes , but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you 're there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers , and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they 're portraying , instead of just being actors performing well-written roles . The action scenes are so brutally fast-paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement ; the stunt-work is nothing short of amazing . The pacing is just incredible . It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion , but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot ; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set-piece . While they 're often simple ( the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone ) they 're charged with such dramatic intensity that you can't take your eyes off them . The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you can't help being swept along by it . With its intense action set-pieces , brilliantly paced storyline , and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security , the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age . Ultimatum is its peak .  
  It 's great how this movie pulls you along . I had honest laughs . Don't care that it 's low budget cause the thing works for me . To be honest my wife didn't really go for it in the same way but she prefers a different type of film . She did admit though that it was very creative and well put together and probably all on a shoe string . These characters who 's lives are strange and troubled give me something to relate to in my own world . Just keep going and be who you are . Dreams are what you make of them . In watching this movie a second and third time I realized that there are some hidden moments that passed by me on the first time through . What can I say , I like my fun with some complexity . Anyway liked it . Hope to see more .  
  This is an early film " Pilot " for the hit Canadian tv show Trailer Park Boys . It was played to executives at a few networks before Showcase decided to sign them up for a tv series . Great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films . The movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around " exterminating " peoples pets for money . If you have a dog next door whos barking all night these are the guys you go to ! But they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout . Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series . I highly recommend it ! Rated R for swearing , violence , and drug use . Its not too offensive either ( they dont actually show killing animals )  
  Half a dozen short stories of varying interest enlighten us about life in Finland . These stories are interwoven and each contains a scene in which a sonic boom is heard . This indicates that the events depicted happen at the same time . The film begins with a bungy jump which promises some excitement but the early stories are quite low key . The film improves so stick with it . Two broken marriages in stories that follow provide plenty of drama while a scene in a hospital gives us a terminally ill patient begging for pain relief . The last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving . While the various scenes of family life take place in Finland , the themes are of a general nature wherever you happen to live . Collections of short stories are rarely as satisfying as a good tense 90-minute drama .  
  A charming romantic comedy . The plot is a little too complicated-I tried to summarize it three times and I can't . Suffice to say it 's worth seeing . The movie is funny , beautiful-the plot is totally unrealistic but it works . Everybody in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great-it creates a sweet , romantic feel through the entire film . The acting is great-Robert Downey Jr . and Cybill Shepherd are in top form and enjoying every second of it . Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are just OK but fine . If you 're a sucker for good , sweet sentimental films ( like me ) , catch this one . Also Downey looks great in his underwear ! Extra bonuses-the title song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great song " After All " sung by Cher and Peter Cetera .  
  As a lover of the surreal ( in art and film ) I was pleased to discover this film on IFC . It is definitely a keeper . Most of the other reviews tell the general plot ( not all correct ) so I won't bother to bore anyone with that . The main thing is the alternate worlds concept which is brought on by Ana 's impending illness , and the way she manages to link with someone else after being so " alone " , and finally with her family , which I believe is still at least a little troubled . It only can be called a horror movie in that it has frightening scenes but is a fantasy ( with a little hint of " coming of age " only because Ana is a pre-teen who " hates boys " ) . I heartily recommend it to those who appreciate the stretch of their imagination .  
  In the film Kongwon-do ui him it features a relatively intimate look into the meaningfulness ( as well as general meaninglessness ) into the lives of various Koreans ; empty people seeking ways to fill themselves , enjoying the escapism of nature . From the beginning to the end of the film we observe the fallibility of the various characters ; we learn of their shortcomings and their desires , the overall complexity captured within human life ( and yet the overal simplicity of humanity ) . Although the film is slow-moving , it can be very contemplative . It does not force any ideas , but allows the ideas to come about themselves , it allows the concepts to reveal themselves . The film ends as well and as suddenly as it begins , and one truly understands the meaning of aloneness , that love is often an act of selfishness , and the many mistakes that we make . It is a look into everyday life , very well and beautifully done . If you are looking for action or for intense drama , this is not the film for you . However , if you enjoy honest , original , and meaningful films that are not forced and without glitz , this is a great film to watch .  
  Love it , love it , love it ! This is another absolutely superb performance from the Divine Miss M . From the beginning to the end , this is one big treat ! Don't rent it - buy it now !  
  Fever Pitch has many of the clichés we have come to identify with Hollywood romantic comedies : a relationship between two people with little in common , the secret he 's been hiding that she discovers , the inevitable breakup , and the very public  well , I won't go any further but you get the picture . In spite of its predictability , it works , especially if you love baseball as I do , though I 'm not quite as obsessive as Ben Wrightman , a Boston schoolteacher played by Saturday Night Live comedian Jimmy Fallon . Adapted from a novel by Nick Hornby by veteran screenplay writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel , Ben is a lifelong Boston Red Sox fan whose Uncle gave him season tickets when he was seven years old and he 's been kind of stuck emotionally at that point all of his life to the detriment of his relationships with women . Ben is not just a fan but a " fanatic " who travels to Fort Meyers , Florida each winter for the Red Sox Spring Training games and never misses a home game during the regular season . His family does not consist of parents or siblings but the fellow groupies who attend each game with him and his bedroom is not a place to sleep but a Red Sox museum to visit . When he falls for business consultant Lindsay Meeks ( Drew Barrymore ) , he is threatened with the possibility of having to grow up but Ben is not quite ready to do that . He would rather attend the Yankee series than go with her to Baltimore to meet her parents or to go to Paris with her and miss the Anaheim series . It takes his relationship being on the verge of dissolving , for him to stop and think about his priorities , especially when a pint-size Dr . Phil wannabe asks him , " You love the Red Sox , but have they ever loved you back ? " While the premise of Fever Pitch is that some things are more important than baseball ( perish the thought ) , you would never know it from the way things turn out . Of course , to any one familiar with the history of the Boston Red Sox , it is a team that will break the hearts of its most die hard fans - but this is 2004 , the year the curse of the Bambino came to an end and as the Red Sox move to a new level , Ben might just do the same . Both lead performances are excellent and the Farrelly Brothers even manage a pretty gross gag . While Fever Pitch will never be mistaken for an art film , it is a joyous romp that will have to go down as one of my guilty pleasures . Go Blue Jays ! .  
  It 's rare , nowadays , to find a romantic comedy that isn't incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the entire movie ( eg . Big Fat Greek wedding ; Me , Myself & Irene ) . There were only a couple of unnecessarily demented jokes in this movie , nothing unpalatably profane . All around , it was a cute movie with likable characters . I thought the ending was a little abrupt . It feels like they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang up finish . The acting left a little to be desired , but was made up for by the pace of the story . If I 'd known it was a Farrelly brothers movie I would have assumed it to be a stomach turning piece of garbage and not watched it , but it seems that even they are capable of accidentally making an okay movie . Good for them , I hope they pull their heads out the rest of the way and start consistently making good films .  
  I 've been trying to find out about this series for ages ! Thank you , IMDb ! I saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind . As a 6-year old , of course , I was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops , which was absolutely chilling ( I talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine , which I still have ) What I also remember , though , was the atmosphere , which was unusual right from the beginning - mysterious , austere , and extremely authentic . When I read the original many years later I experienced that same sensation . It 's a very hard thing to capture - and probably impossible in Hollywood . Every ' Odyssey ' I 've seen since has been an enormous let-down . The characters in this series seemed genuine , real people - ancient Greek people - and not some Hollywood stars in costumes . This is a real masterpiece ! But - Why is it not better known ? And why isn't it available on VHS or DVD ? I would just love to have the chance to see this again !  
  This film has great acting , great photography and a very strong story line that really makes you think about who you are , how you define yourself , how you fit in , whether you accept to play a role or break free .. There already are excellent comments dealing with these aspects . I want to comment on the formal setting of the film . Basically , it 's two people on a roof . There is unity of place and time , with 2 protagonists , and the radio acting as the choir . Many directors have turned Greek tragedies into film , many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a Greek tragedy , but no director , in my opinion , has succeeded as admirably as Ettore Scola in approaching the purity and force of the great Greek tragedies both in story line and formal setting . A masterpiece .  
  Soylent Green I found to be an excellent movie . If you like Logan 's Run you 'll like this . Yes the movie is old and there are no special effects and some of the acting can somewhat be best described as " cheesy " but the story is excellent . The story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very poignant . At the end the mystery wasn't a mystery but the story unfolded in an easy at the right pace . It 's nearest modern day equivalent would be " Dark Angel " in terms of how the US is shown to be third-world country .  
  Truly amazing film , the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is frightening . A world vastly overpopulated , unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer , and all our natural resources spent . In this nightmarish degenerate society we have the great Charlton Heston as a likable film noirish style detective trying to fathom the truth behind a murder , opposite the film noir legend Edward G Robinson turning in a fine last performance . One of the images that will always stay with me from this film , is the masses of people that populate the stairwells and the way in which Thorne ( Heston ) has to hop through them every time he uses them . The movie 's use of music is note worthy too , although it contains no score in the usual sense , The opening theme is good , and the subsequent snatches of music we here in Simonson 's apartment , and especially the Beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic are outstandingly atmospheric .  
  The pioneering Technicolor Cinematography ( Winner of Special Technical Achievement Oscar ) is indeed enchanting . Add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream team like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer , and you 've got a rather pleasant " picture " . Unfortunately the contrived plot as well as the over-blown acting leave much to be desired . Still , there have not been any more breathtaking Technicolor films before this one ( 1936 ) , and very few since then , that can top this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors . Cinema fans who have enjoyed the glorious color cinematography in " Robin Hood " ( 1938 ) , " Jesse James " ( 1939 ) and " Gone With The Wind " ( 1939 ) , will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here . " The Garden Of Allah " will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography .  
  " Descent . " Yeah . Boy .. I haven't seen anything this powerful and scintillating since Bruno Dumont 's , " Twentynine Palms " ( 2003 ) . ( By the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent pic about the topic of " female empowerment , " " THE Descent " ( 2005 ) , directed by our Splat Pack friend , Neil Marshall , who also happens to be a major talent his own right . ) But getting back to this " Descent , " the NC-17 rated ( uh-oh ) effort on which the lovely Ms . Dawson takes a producer 's credit ( congratulations ) and directed by Talia Lugacy ( strong chance that 's not a real name ) , as good as it is ( in moments ) , it will not be appreciated by most lay people out there because the script is pretty flawed . As a producer , you really have to tighten up that script . Of course , in the premise alone , you have the promise of rising conflict , but there still lies the task therein of accomplishing rising conflict . At times , this thing plays like an interesting piece of experimental theater and , well , I guess I 'll let the others who 've already commented here speak to the boringness of it , namely that which occurs in the second act - but find me a second act that isn't boring ? There 's also this Catch 22 that goes along with these quasi-independent films like " Descent " in which Rosario happens to be attaching herself to and leveraging her " fame-identity " to get a script into production that would , under usual circumstances , not get made at all while at the same time she is basically a miscast in the film 's leading role . Rosario Dawson is gorgeous and , apparently , you can shoot this girl from just about any angle all day long , but , oh , wow-wee , how fast the time just slips away : Rosy ain't no undergraduate no more . That 's part of the confusion about the screenplay : " Is she a graduate student ? A TA ? No , graduate students don't really have these type of qualms with football players , do they ? " Again , if you are Rosario Dawson , Executive Producer , that 's the one of many , many aspects to the professional film process you 'll have to think about as you embark on this wonderful new role in your film career . And if you don't have the answer to why you 're movie isn't convincing , let me tell you : there is a boatload and a bevy of vivacious , well-qualified , undergraduate aged talents , pining to get involved in the business , who might have nailed that lead character down , all the while , looking just as darn good as you know who ; but unfortunately without Ms . Dawson - no Honey , NO money . I have to say , the camera department did an outstanding job , however , because this film is really well shot ( i . e . lit ) in all its dreary / dreamy darkness . The nightclub scenes look wonderful ; one can tell all those music videos are starting to pay off and the play with time .. The shooting / framing is all quite excellent which makes the picture a rewarding watch . " Descent " is good not great . However , I have a feeling , thanks to NetFlix , this movie will find a life of its own . I hope this group continues making films . If you 're into experimental American film-making , cinematographic imagery of implausibly well formed college studs ( or male model drop-outs ) in their early twenties , or if you 're an undergraduate , just plain angry at the hormonally aggressive young men that comprise less than half of your American university , " Rosario Dawson 's Descent " might be your flavor of RockaRoll .  
  The story for the first-aired television installment of " Columbo " is simple : one-half of successful mystery-writing team does away with the other , frames an unseen Mafia group , is blackmailed by an admirer , does away with the admirer , and is tricked up by the stalwart Columbo . With that said , this is still one of the most entertaining in the show 's history , benefiting tremendously by the work of the late Jack Cassidy and star Peter Falk . Besides the notability of being directed by a young Steven Spielberg , the episode also has a air of the macabre because of the future of two of its stars : Cassidy and Barbara Colby . The two share several scenes together and it is poignant that both would die tragically within a decade of this filming , Cassidy in an apartment fire and Colby at the hands of assailants , yet to be found after over three decades . Now , both demises are true-life MYSTERIES !  
  Pretty good picture about a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time . If the murderer wanted to whack the dame , why not just off her and let the cops try to figure out whodunnit ? Involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous , not to mention all the mouths you 'd have to worry about staying shut . Why did the depressed lady go out to the bar when she could barely sit up in a chair or say a word ? Are there really cops out there who are wise cracking , gum popping , grinning apes who approach a suspect in such a glib manner ? This probably played well back before the wheel was invented , but it is so corny and unbelievable today . Catch the manic drum break by Elisha Cook ; his frenetic hammering never once matched the recording . His mad facial expressions made up for the off kilter stick sync .  
  Joseph L . Mankiewicz is not remembered by most today as one of the finest directors in Hollywood history , but this film proves that he is . Already a success by doing sophisticated American dramas such as A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve as well as successfully adapting Shakespeare to life in Julius Caesar , Mankiewicz does a marvelous job of bringing this hit Broadway play to film and does it with style . Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson , even if he can't sing too well . He is the only actor who could pull it off perfectly wit his sheer coolness and clarity . Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer , as expected , and does a good job of acting as Nathan Detroit . Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando sizzle with great chemistry . All supporting actors do their part , especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horse in a very funny bit . Still , Mankiewicz should be given most of the credit for bringing a fine musical in its own right to the screen in such a way that it feels authentic in many scenes but is still a story in its own world . All in all , Guys and Dolls is a great musical and works on many levels it normally should not have .  
  Guys and Dolls is a unique play based on the characters . Sky Masterson ( Marlon Brando ) is a high-class gambler who takes up a bet with Nathan Detroit ( Frank Sinatra ) for one-thousand dollars . Nathan needs the money so he can run his usual crap game and make a fortune . The bet was that Sky wouldn't be able to take just any girl to Havana , Cuba and the " doll " he chose was Sarah Brown ( Jean Simmons ) who was in charge of a missionary . Sky finally bribes Sarah enough to go to Havana with him . They end up falling in love with each other , but later she accuses him of something he had no part in . Nathan ran a crap game in the missionary the night they were gone . Nathan 's 14 year fiancé Adelaide ( Vivian Blaine ) disapproves of Nathan 's gambling and tries to stop him from doing it . However , when the movie ends it all ends happy with a double wedding . The songs in this movie are just wonderful no matter who sings it . Marlon Brando has no singing voice at all and true they could have dubbed him but it didn't really matter . He did a wonderful acting job ( obviously seeing as it 's Brando ) and played his character very well . I have seen a few movies with Jean Simmons and thought that this movie was her weakest one , she also couldn't sing at all . However , the singing is made up by Frank Sinatra , Vivien Blaine , and Stubby Kaye . Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye was also in the original Broadway production of Guys and Dolls . Vivien Blaine had a terrific voice and was the perfect Adelaide . If you like musical , and even if you don't , i advise you to watch this .  
  " Girlfight " follows a project dwelling New York high school girl from a sense of futility into the world of amateur boxing where she finds self esteem , purpose , and much more . Although the film is not about boxing , boxing is all about the film . So much so you can almost smell the sweat . Technically and artistically a good shoot with an sense of honesty and reality about it , " Girlfight " is no chick flick and no " Rocky " . It is , rather , a very human drama which even viewers who don't know boxing will be able to connect with .  
  As predictable as a Hallmark card , but not without merit , The Rookie makes for a solid outing . Dennis Quaid , the most reasonable jock actor working today , is absolutely perfect as the science teacher turned baseball player Jimmy Morris . The film is never dumbed down for the children , as would be expected from a G rated film . As a sports film , The Rookie is one of the best I have seen since Any Given Sunday .  
  Delightful film directed by some of the best directors in the industry today . The film is also casting some of the great actors of our time , not just from France but from everywhere . My favorite segments : 14th arrondissement : Carol ( Margo Martindale ) , from Denver , comes to Paris to learn French and also to make a sense of her life . Montmartre : there was probably not a better way to start this movie than with this segment on romantic Paris . Loin du 16ème : an image of Paris that we are better aware of since the riots in the Cités . Ana ( Catalina Sandino Moreno ) spends more time taking care of somebody else 's kid ( she 's a nanny ) than of her own . Quartier Latin : so much fun to see Gérard Depardieu as the " tenancier de bar " with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discussing their divorce . Tour Eiffel : don't tell me you didn't like those mimes ! Tuileries : such a treat to see Steve Buscemi as the tourist who 's making high-contact ( a no - no ) with a girl in the Metro . Parc Monceau : Nick Nolte is great . Ludivine Sagnier also . I 've spend 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to go back ! Seen in Barcelona ( another great city ) , at the Verdi , on March 18th , 2007 . 84/100 ( * )  
  The dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies ; as is the equally dehumanising , but potentially life-saving , dehumanising effect of military training . Joel Schumacher 's ' Tigerland ' follows the standard template , we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers , with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers , and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified ; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained ( typically , as here , Vietnam ) . But ' Tigerland ' has an interesting take , by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz ( played outstandingly well by Colin Farrell ) , who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent , and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity . Around this character , a taught , gripping plot has been constructed , and it 's also a plus that the action never leaves America ( whereas Stanley Kubrick 's ' Full Metal Jacket ' , to name just one other film of a similar type , lost focus once the action shifted to Asia ) . Although this is not a film of staggering originality , it 's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout : the best film from this director that I 've seen , and among the very best of its genre .  
  Spielberg 's first dramatic film is no let-down . It 's a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an African-American woman . It also proves that not all movies that have the African-American ethnicity as the center of the story have to be helmed by an African-American director . What I love about this movie is Spielberg 's ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book . Furthermore , Danny Glover was excellent as Mr . And usually , he 's just himself throughout most of his movies . But in this , he completely branches out and is someone else for once . But , the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from Whoopi Goldberg . She is excellent as Celie . You will never forget these characters once you 've seen this movie . Now , I heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well , and all I can say is : I hope it 's about as good as this one is , because this one is a film that shouldn't be missed .  
  This movie took my breath away at some points , I simply loved it ! I admit that the character dialogs and storyline could have been done a bit better , but hey , this is just a simple ( short ) story of a couple of guys trying to slain a dragon , there 's nothing more to it ! The overall design , atmosphere , the beautiful landscapes .. it 's all just magical ! They 've put a lot of love in this movie . Character designs were great and funny . A bit Tim Burton-ish if you like . I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in great design , displayed in a simple small , but lovely story .  
  Have you heard the story about the reluctant heroes who were hired by a King to slay a dragon ? Oh , you have ? Was it set in a world entirely composed of small islands floating above clouds , and did the heroes have to make dangerous leaps from one island to the next on their journey ? Did water flow upwards and remnants of great cities levitate on the horizon ? I didn't think so . I stumbled onto this movie by accident and I 'm really glad that I did ! It 's one of the most beautiful movies I 've ever seen . Much like the Pixar movies , it 's a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in today 's world . The animators have invested thought into almost everything that appears on the screen , and this attention to detail is staggering ( the scene where the mushrooms in the foreground belch green smoke whilst the characters walk obliviously in the background is one of my favourites ) . The monsters are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in action . Although the plot may not be entirely unique , the movie has enough charm to make sure you keep watching . Our protagonists are likable and interesting , ensuring the audience is behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon which might otherwise devour everything in its path . Of course , Hector is the character most will fall in love with . A small blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and English , Hector provides comedy relief in a way Jar Jar Binks could only dream of . In summary , I 'd recommend watching The Dragon Hunters if you get the opportunity . Watch it for the incredible animation , the breath-taking battle scenes and for a glimpse into a world that 's unlike anything else you 've seen on a cinema or television screen . At the very least , it 's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - no matter if you 're nine or twenty-nine ( which , in fact , I am ) !  
  One of the finest films ever made ! Why it only got a 7.6 rating is a mystery . This film is a window into the world of the black experience in America . Should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10 . I recommend watching it with " The Long Walk Home " as a companion piece . If you think Whoopi Goldberg 's work is about " Homer and Eddie " or " Hollywood Squares , " think again . Don't miss this movie , which should have won the Oscar . ( And read the book , too ! )  
  As I am always looking for something new and unique , I watched this film online . I thought that it would be just another " B " rate movie but I was amazed at the acting by the two main characters . All of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed . The plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story . This movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp , " Dumb and Dumber " or blood and guts . This is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting . I would prefer this movie to many " A " rate movies I have seen even a great number with high box office earnings . I highly recommend this movie .  
  yeah right . Sammo Hung already acted in the main role in 1983 's " Zu Warrios from the Magic Mountain " . Now , 2001 , he does it again with " Zu Warriors " . But this time , he finally does it right . You seldom see him in wuxia , more often in classic eastern or crime slapstick . But this role simply does fit him ! The ancient Chinese legend about zu mountain is not often represented in movies ( as far as I know about movies translated for the west ) . Although , the legend contains a vast of interesting stories and possibilities . Straight said : you haven't seen a story alike yet in a modern movie ! And that makes it so great ! And wow : all the colors plus the enormously deep , right into the heart going story makes you fall for this movie in an instant . The first time I watched it , I had to watch it again instantly , and I did . OK true , I didn't understand all of it the first time . But that makes it only better ! You know , you didn't understand all of it , because there is so much spice in it ! Therefor it is a pleasure for one self to watch it over and over again . And yeah , it grows deeper in your heart , the more often you watch it . Summary : A story to love , characters you cry with , and truly : a movie you never forget ! - Editors note : well , I think I must watch it right now again : D  
  I first saw this film as a young boy and recently purchased it on DVD . James Stewart brings great depth to the role of Chip Hardesty , a hardworking and dedicated FBI agent . His life in the Bureau is intercut with his family life , which is not all rosy . His wife ( an excellent portrayal by Vera Miles ) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job , and they even separate for a time ; Chip 's best friend and fellow agent Sam Crandall ( Murray Hamilton ) is killed in a gunfight ; Chip 's son , Mike , enlists in the Marines during World War II . Through it all , the family carries on with bravery and dignity . The action sequences are quite exciting and the semi-documentary style of the film works effectively . And the music by Max Steiner says it all ; fidelity , bravery and integrity . This country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the FBI and , yes , to J . Edgar Hoover as well . If Mr . Hoover 's type of vigilance had been observed , we might have been spared 9/11 , the surge in crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we 've had to put up with since his passing .  
  This is apparently one of Shemp 's first shorts with the Stooges . ( This excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team ) . But the threesome 's comedic timing is at its honed best here . Aside from the intense slapstick scenes , there are others more subtle , but just as funny . Watch Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot . Or watch the real object prompting Moe 's exclamation , " Oh .. highly polished mahogany ! " Emil Sitka is at his bewildered goofiest . And the goon may look scary , but he 's somehow funny . He seems as frustrated and perplexed with the Stooges as are " regular " people in other shorts . For Shemp aficionados , this is a must have episode . It won't disappoint .  
  Although at one point I thought this was going to turn into The Graduate , I have to say that The Mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman . I 'm so glad this is a British film because Hollywood never would have done it , and even if they had , they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters . The story is revealed slowly and realistically . The acting is superb , the characters are believably flawed , and the dialogue is sensitive . I tried many times to predict what was going to happen , and I was always wrong , so I was very intrigued by the story . I highly recommend this movie . And I must confess , I 'll forever look at my mom in a different light !  
  When Tsui Hark experiments , nothing and no one can withstand him . Legend of Zu is possibly 6Hours condensed into 1h40 . One does not understand all , but like at " 2001 A Space Odyssey " you also don't have to , but one feels the power of the film to every second , every picture . An extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering , astounding , rejoicing in the recent years . VITAL severe MASTERPIECE ! It 's absolutely perfect as it is .

  Pinjar is truly a masterpiece .. . It 's a thought provoking Film that makes you think and makes you question our culture . It is without a doubt the best Hindi movie I have seen to date . This film should have been shown at movie festivals around the world and I believe would have been a serious contender at Cannes . All the characters were perfectly cast and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai were haunting in their roles . The story the movie tells about partition is a very very important story and one that should never be forgotten . It has no biases or prejudices and has given the partition a human story . Here , no one country is depicted as good or bad . There are evil Indians , evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistanis . The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious , meaningful and haunting . Everything about the movie was amazing .. and the acting just took my breath away . All were perfectly cast .  
  Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki film . After seeing it for the first time I 'm glad to say that it doesn't disappoint . On the contrary , you get your time 's worth , which means ( as to what Miyazaki 's films are concern ) , that is nothing less than excellent ! Produced early in his cinematic career , Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies , with strong ( but young ) female characters , forced to grow up due to external circumstances , helped out by very interesting ( and some times lovable ) supporting characters . And , of course , the usual battle of nature versus civilization , flying machines ( lots of it ! ) , beautiful painted sceneries  but alas , no pigs ( at least that i 've noticed , after all I have only seen it once ) . Never the less , Miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier , with Nausicãa , which was a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke , his magnum opus . Castle in the Sky is set a bit a part from these two , with a soft action packed first 30 minutes , resembling his TV series Conan , and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes . In here we are introduced to Sheeta , a girl who literally falls from the sky , only to be found by Pazu , a young boy working in a little countryside mining town . Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa , Pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from , whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates . As the movie progresses , the plot gets heavier and much more interesting , revealing Myiazaki at his best . The sound track is very reminiscent of Spirited Away , ( or vice versa , as Castle in the sky was produced first ) , and much like its director , Joe Hisaishi _ the composer _ starts with a very light score , that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward ! A note to the English dubbing , with a good interpretation from the two lead stars , although Anna Paquin 's Sheeta has a very thick accent ( which the actress still had at that point in her career ) , and a heads up for Mark Hamil as Muska , making up for a delighting yet devilish villain ! Don't miss this one people !  
  Youth , sexuality , and the French countryside - one of the more unique films you 're ever going to see . If you can see it that is , no mean feat considering how hard it is to find copies of it ( a combination of scarcity and censorship . ) It 's sometimes erotic , sometimes disgusting , and occasionally funny . A trifle boring also in the middle , but all in all you can't call yourself an aficionado of bizarre film until you 've seen this one at least once .  
  I 've watched a bunch of episodes of Cold Case since its premiered ( especially now that it immediately follows The Amazing Race , but this was one of the best instances of writing and acting I 've seen from the house of Bruckheimer . The casting , especially of the younger officers , was spot on , and the script and editing , the soundtrack , and the acting made this episode a tour d'force . If I were the producers I would submit this episode for Emmy consideration . It amazing how complete a portrait was made of Coop and Jimmy within the confines of s 48 minute episode ; that takes a lot of talented people doing their best . I hope there 's is advance warning of when this episode is repeated , because I 'm sure I 'll notice a lot that I did not notice the first time around .  
  No , this hilariously horrible 70 's made-for-TV horror clinker isn't about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake . Still , this exceptionally awful , yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute , unremitting silliness and atrociousness that 's quite tasty in a so execrable it's downright awesome sort of way . Richard Crenna , looking haggard and possibly inebriated , and Yvette Mimieux , who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in " Jackson County Jail , " sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint , dull , sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute German Shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit . Pretty soon Mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann ( the psychic alien moppets from the Disney " Witch Mountain " pictures ) are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty , ugly canine entity in the den . Boy , now doesn't that sound really scary and disturbing ? Well , scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain't , but it sure is funny , thanks to Curtis ( " Night Tide " ) Harrington 's hopelessly weak direction , cartoonish ( not so ) special effects , an almost painfully risible'n'ridiculous plot , and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story ( besides the leads , both Martine Beswicke and R.G. Armstrong briefly pop up as members of a Satanic cult and Victor Jory has a nice cameo as a helpful Native American shaman ) . Favorite scene : the malicious Mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on Crenna , practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade . While stuck-up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock , devout TV trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to Alpo .  
  Samuel Fuller 's Pickup on South Street is anomalous : A " Red Scare " movie devoid of hysteria , in which the Communist threat is nothing more than the McGuffin that ignites the plot . Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves loose woman Jean Peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm ; unbeknownst to either of them , it harbors secrets vital to the Cold War . Peters , as it happens , was under surveillance by FBI agents who are as nonplussed by the theft as the man who 's running her , cowardly comsymp Richard Kiley . In trying to retrieve the precious film , both sides enlist the help of Thelma Ritter , a streetwise old jane who 's always on the earie and willing to sell what she hears . Fuller draws from an opulent palette of tempos and tonalities in telling the story , which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality . From the subways to the waterfront , his midsummer Manhattan takes on a sweaty sheen that 's almost pungent . The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mixture of the tumultuous and the tender , and they 're scored to " Again , " a song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House , also starring Widmark . The pace slackens for Ritter 's beautifully written and played death scene - among the most poignant vignettes in all noir , and a kind of mirage-oasis in a film parched of sentimentality . This is writer / director Fuller 's only work in the strictest confines of the noir cycle ; his later explorations of American pathology ( The Crimson Kimono , The Naked Kiss , Underworld U.S.A. ) never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as Pickup on South Street .  
  This is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s . This minimalist and fast-working director has something unusual for his earlier films-a cast with some stars . Richard Widmark , Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this film about a group of Communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets out of America-and they 'll stop at nothing to succeed . The film starts with Peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents . They know she is a link in a long espionage chain . Unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equation-a small-time pickpocket ( Widmark ) is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that Peters is carrying . Widmark thinks it 's just another purse he 's ransacked-only later does he realize the seriousness of what he 's stolen . Now it 's Widmark on his own-with Commies and the FBI hot on his trail . Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish . Although she didn't get top billing , a special mention should be made of Thelma Ritter . This supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her lifetime as a stool pigeon . Seldom was she given this much of a chance to act and I was impressed by her ability to play a broken down and sad old lady . As far as the script and directing go , they are very good-but with one small exception . At first , I loved the way Widmark and Peters interacted . It 's one of the few times on film you 'll see a woman punched square in the mouth ! Now THAT 'S tough . Later , inexplicably , they become amazingly close-too close to be believable . Still , with so much great drama and such an effective Noir-like film , this can be overlooked . See this film .  
  The movie has a great written genre story . It features all of the usual Columbo ingredients ; The way Lt . Columbo approaches and bonds to his suspect , the way the mystery unravels for him , Columbo 's dog , the cat and mouse play , which is great in this one and luckily as well some good relieving humor , mostly involving the Columbo character . It 's all written despite the fact that it doesn't even have a truly original concept . Columbo hunting down a detective / murder novel writer had been done more than once before in a Columbo movie . It 's also an extremely well directed movie from James Frawley , who after this directed 5 more Columbo movies , in the ' 70 's and ' 80 's . He provided the movie with style and some truly great and memorable sequences . It 's one of the slower moving Columbo movies , despite not having a too long running time . This style and approach doesn't always work out well for a Columbo movie but in this movie it does , which is perhaps not in the least thanks to the acting performances of the movie . Most Columbo movie either starred a big well known star or a star from the early days of film-making , as the movie its murderer . This movie stars the rather unknown 81 year old Ruth Gordon . She didn't starred in an awful lot of movies throughout her career but she is still well known to some , mostly for her role in " Rosemary 's Baby " , which also won her an Oscar . She had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting , which some people might not like though . It earned her 4 more Oscar nominations throughout her career , prior to her win for " Rosemary 's Baby " , in 1969 . She has some great interaction as well with Peter Falk in their sequences together . The movie also stars a still young G.D. Spradlin . I say young because I only know him from his latest productions out of his career , despite the fact that he already was 57 at the time of this Columbo production . He is still alive but retired from acting , ever since 1999 . An even better than usual Columbo movie entry . 8/10  
  I really enjoyed this movie . The script is fresh and unpredictable and the acting is outstanding . It is a down-to-earth movie with characters one cares about . It brought tears into my eyes a few times but left me with a great feeling afterwards .  
  During a Kurt Weill celebration in Brooklyn , WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE ? was finally unearthed for a screening . It is amazing that a motion picture , from any era , that has Weill-Gershwin collaborations can possibly be missing from the screens . The score stands tall , and a CD of the material , with Gershwin and Weill , only underscores its merits , which are considerable . Yes , the film has its problems , but the score is not one of them . Ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy , and Fred MacMurray cannot quite grasp the material . Then , too , the ' modern ' segment is weakly written . BUT the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark , as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies - Joan Leslie and June Haver . Both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work . As a World War II salute to our country 's history - albeit in a ' never was ' framework , the film has its place in Hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits .  
  A milestone in Eastern European film making and an outstanding example of Serbian mentality . A group of completely different people are doomed to die because of their discord . With " Maratonci trce pocasni krug " makes two mythological movies everyone here knows word by word .  
  There wasn't a dry eye amongst the audience yesterday afternoon after I left the cinema , having seen this gem of a film in a sold-out house as part of this year 's Hamburg Film Festival . And the tears shed were all of laughter . This film was hilarious , there 's no other way of saying this . There wasn't one boring bit in it , I laughed right through it and with me everyone else of us three hundred lovers of French cinéma . Alain Chabat was absolutely terrific . A great clown if needs be and serious if the situation calls for it . The performance was of course completely over the top , but this was exactly what the story needed and what made it work so well . Equally great was Charlotte Gainsbourg who I love to see a lot , and the mother was also a very strong performance . The sisters could have been a bit more detailed in character script-wise , but apart from that there is nothing to moan about . I had a great afternoon seeing this film while Hamburg was drowning in rain outside , and I wish films like this from France would get a regular release in Germany . But the distributors is this country don't seem to understand that the French make good films . I at least can't wait to find a DVD which offers subtitles ( Hello Australia ? Please ? ) because that film I need at home to watch several more times !  
  The mere fact that I still think of the movie a decade later is what really speaks volumes about the film . To me this substantiates Grand Canyon as a film that will touch you in one way or another . I truly believe that before the movie Crash there was Grand Canyon . The major difference between the two films in my opinion is the timing of their release . I 'm not going to argue which one is better , but I will contend to the idea that they share the same message . I 'd love to hear from those that have an opinion on this subject . I will start a commentary which you can find at http : / ww . myspace . com / 62229249 . You may also find me there to post any other topics about movies that we may share , because i have a true love for film .  
  Cuban Blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way . I actually watched it while sailing around Cuba on a western Caribbean cruise . It details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution . Not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end , when the Socialist regime came and took the property of the boy 's father . The majority of the film is the boy 's coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else . There are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to . A class A film with fine acting and directing . This is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists . It is a film about people and their lives , their mistakes , and their triumphs . A good film worth watching several times annually .  
  Although some may call it a " Cuban Cinema Paradiso " , the movie is closer to a How Green Was My Valley , a memory film mourning for a lost innocence . The film smartly avoids falling into a political trap of taking sides ( pro-Castro ? anti-Castro ? , focusing instead in the human frailty of the characters and the importance of family . Filled with good acting , in particular from Mexican actress Diana Bracho , who plays Keitel 's wife . A masterpiece , filled with references to classic movies , from CASABLANCA to Chaplin 's CITY LIGHTS . Gael Garcia Bernal plays a small role which is critical for the dramatic payoff of the story . TV director Georg Stanford Brown , in a rare return to acting ( remember THE ROOKIES ? ) , plays a homeless bum who acts as Greek chorus , superbly . It is a pity that this movie , originally titled DREAMING OF JULIA , has been released in the States by THINKfilm with the atrocious title of CUBAN BLOOD , which has nothing to do with the movie .  
  Barbara Stanwyck gives this early Douglas Sirk-directed , Universal-produced soap just the kick that it needs . Not nearly as memorable as Sirk 's later melodramas , it 's easy to see by watching " All I Desire " where Sirk would be heading artistically in the next few years . Stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to her family in smalltown , U.S.A , after deserting them a decade earlier . Her family and community have mixed emotions in dealing with her shocking return . Some of the cinematography is amazing , and Stanwyck is tough-as-nails and really gives this film a shot of energy . Overall , a fairly good show .  
  An old man who lives in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat . He wanders the woods to witness a murder but did he see the murder or is he losing his mind ? Is he just getting old ? The movie so great because the viewer has to make up their own mind on what is going on . There is very little dialog in this movie but it doesn't need words , the whole movie speaks for itself . You knew what was going on and I liked it . The other part that I liked were the shots of the woods in late fall and winter . Those were pretty but the only thing I didn't like was the view of the old man in his underwear . He could have tied the robe a little tighter but other than that , it was a pretty deep movie .  
  I really think I should make my case and have every ( horror and or cult ) movie-buff go and see this movie .. I did ! It-is-excellent : Very atmospheric and unsettling and scary .. Incridible how they could make such a gem of a film with the very low ( read - " no " ! ) - budget they had .. Synopsis taken from website : " One morning , an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat . He finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no corpse .. " On this website ( IMDb ) there is no trailer , but I will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there IS a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it out .. ww . softfordigging . com  
  Though I liked On the Town better I really liked it . I 'm a new comer when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly . Though I had heard of them I had never seen anything with them in it until recently . The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain that made me a fan of Gene 's . I think that is better too . But I thought that this movie was good and like all movies there are some parts that are better than others but in my book it 's an awesome movie and I love it . Frank and Gene make a good team . I have yet to see them together in Take me out to the Ballgame . But I 'm sticking to my guns bu saying that I really enjoyed it , and that I love it !  
  Yes , this is one of the great musical movies I grew up with with such great entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly , not to mention the petite and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson . The music and dancing is superb . I understand Frank took lessons from Kelly ; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse , which is quite unique for the time . Betty Garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra . She is one of Hollywood 's great underrated stars . I saw this again on A & E TV and as well have it in my old VCR tapes . Never get tired of these old musicals . Whatever happened to Hollywood ?  
  Usually musicals in the 1940 's were of a set formula - and if you studied films you know what I 'm talking about - a certain running lenghth , very " showy " performances that were great on the surface but never got into the real personalities of the characters etc . THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT - and light years better and well worth it 's nomination for best picture of the year - 1945 ( although had no chance of beating the eventual winner - Lost Weekend ) . Gene Kelly was probably in the best form of his career - yes I know about " American in Paris " and " Singing in the Rain " . This one is different . He really gets into his character of a " sea wolf " thinking ( at first ) that " picking up any girl while on leave " is nothing more than a lark . And if you had to make up a " story " to get her - so be it - until . Sort of like the Music Man when he gets " his foot caught in the door " . The eventual hilarity of the film stems mostly from his and his new pal ( Sinatra ) ' s attempt to make the " story " good in order to " get the girl " that he REALLY and unexpectedly falls in love with . You are going to have to see the movie to see what I mean . Besides that there are so many other elements of great film in this one , it 's a classic buddy story , nostalgia to a time when WWII was almost over ( the war ended about a month after the films release ) , a realization that a guy that always laughed at life can find out that he really is a great human being , great songs and probably a few other elements of classic film making that I can't think of right now . Why not a 10 ? Near the end - at nearly 2 1/2 hours starts to feel a bit long . There is a small ballet number that Gene Kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945 but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now . But overall , this ones a definite winner on every level .  
  Insisting that Martin Luther King 's inspirational spirit resides not just in American civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere , Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev transplants this belief to a 1969 Danish middle school . More specifically , it works its way into the crusade of a young boy named Frits ( Janus Dissing Rathke ) against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster Svendsen ( Bent Mejding ) . Adapted from a true story , the performances are executed with certain aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied characters keeps it involving . A battle of ideologies between a 13 year-old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to inherent humour but awkward shifts in mood disorients despite keeping it shrewdly cynical in the same vein as a " Dead Poets Society " more than a " Matilda " . It treads a familiar path but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that rounds off Frits as a young boy becoming a young man , manages to raise the film into a rousing family film with its nose right on the money .  
  I didn't even want to watch this movie after reading Maltin 's review and 1 1/2 star rating . I watched it anyway on the advice of my son and found it much better than I expected . I would give it 2 1/2 stars out of a 4 star system . You have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all . If you don't know much about religion , you will miss a lot . I graduated from high school the year the movie was made , so maybe I can relate to it better . Yes , there is some pretension in the movie and it 's weird to some extent , but that was the 70s so what do you expect . I can see why people might not like the movie ; however , I cannot understand people saying it is boring . The movie is anything but boring . You will either hate it or love it . If you find it boring , you are probably brain dead .  
  This is a lovely , spirit-restoring movie . From the use of the actual villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting , every choice was perfectly right ! The quiet joy of this film doesn't stale after repeated viewings . Josie Lawrence , Miranda Richardson , Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to play these parts ! I would dearly love to see Enchanted April released on DVD in a widescreen format .  
  Princess Tam Tam is without the trappings of racism , in the way we think of racism in the United States , but there are more subtle ( to the American viewer ) assertions about ethnic identity during the time . Pay attention to Alwina 's ( Baker ) placement within shots , how she is addressed by the other characters , the settings around her that all depict her as a " savage " African , and ask yourself if Alwina has any shred of agency throughout the film . I don't want to ruin anything but at the end pay very careful attention , the dichotomy between " Eastern " and " Western " culture is to say the least offensive , such diction is thankfully disavowed these days . The French have a checkered past as an imperial force throughout the areas depicted ( see Chris Marker 's Les Statues Meurent Aussi - 1953 ) , and pay attention to the places the European travelers visit while they are in Africa , and what does that reflect about their attitudes towards the " other " . I give this film a 7 because I am a sucker for Baker , much of what she did in her professional career , like Princes Tam Tam , that is regressive is certainly overshadowed by her efforts towards integration , her work as a freaking spy ( I am gushing , sorry . ) However the film for me is captivating because of her performance , besides that it is a telling relic of bygone mentalities .  
  I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles . I thought the story was good but there were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over-acting . This took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score , which really irked me throughout the entire movie . If the musical score was improved I could overlook the few overacted scenes . Then the film would be much , much better .  
  Well , I would consider Police Story as one of Jackie Chan 's best film . The plot , the fighting scenes and the stunt works are excellent . In this film , Jackie himself acted as a police officer called Chan Ka Kui ( Kevin Chan in some versions ) who successfully arrested a crime lord . After the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence , he framed Chan for the killing of a police officer . Due to this , he became wanted by the police . Later on , Salina ( Brigitte Lin ) , who was the secretary of the crime lord , went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime lord 's crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to Chan . However , the crime lord knew that Salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to capture her . Later on , Chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen , defeating them one by one . At the last scene , Chan was seen punching the crime lord . Lastly , this is the best action and comedy movie . Everyone should watch it . Highly recommended .  
  It 's depressing to see where Jackie Chan has ended up . He used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punches , kicks and incredible stunts . To be fair , he 's now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown . But with ' Rush Hour 3 ' , where he takes a back seat to Chris Tucker ( of all people ! ) , and then there 's ' Kung Fu Panda ' where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character barely has any dialogue .. to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement . It 's times like this when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old VHS tape and watch Jackie kick some arses in his younger , fitter , Chris Tucker-free days . Enter ' Police Story ' . Jackie Chan plays Kar-kui , a policeman whose task it is to protect a witness before a major trial . He faces resistance from both the unco-operative witness and the numerous hit men sent by the mob to silence them both . But on the other hand , who cares ? We don't watch Jackie Chan films for the story . We watch them to see Jackie Chan perform eye-popping stunts and generally punch and kick a whole lot of people who are less awesome than he is . And on that level , ' Police Story ' doesn't disappoint at all . There is an awesome showdown in a shopping mall at the end that culminates in Jackie sliding down a giant , high-voltage chandelier . Seriously , if this sort of thing happened more often , no male would ever need coaxing to go shopping for clothes . There is also comedy , much of which involves Kar-kui inadvertently upsetting May ( Maggie Cheung ) , his eternally suffering and apparently ever forgiving girlfriend . The humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle , but it works so I 'm not complaining . The acting isn't too subtle , either . Indeed , I 'm not sure there was anything subtle about ' Police Story ' at all . Director Jackie Chan ( yeah , he does that too ) clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films , and knows that while we 're waiting for the next fight to start , the last thing we want is to be looking for nuance and depth and inner meaning . So ' Police Story ' is a blast . As is the case with most of his films , the fact that Jackie actually does the stuff you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition . I mean , when Jackie Chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella , a whole new " Wow ! " factor is added to the action .  
  This movie has one of the cheesiest plots I have seen . For me , that 's what makes it so awesome ! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series . While there was less slapstick , they still worked wonderfully together " comedically . " I wish Yvonne De Carlo , as Lily , would have had more plot involvement . She showed that she could do comedy in the original series , but it was mostly wasted in this movie . This movie also stars the great Sid Caesar , but sadly he doesn't have any interaction with Gwynne and Lewis . I think some better work could have come out of that .  
  I really enjoyed this movie . I was fifteen when this movie came out and I could relate . This will be a movie I would show my kids to let them know , the feelings they are having are normal . It is funny to see how we could be so devestated by things at such a young age .. who knew that we would bounce back .. again and again .. Great movie !  
  Directed and co-written by Eytan Fox the writer / director of the highly acclaimed 2002 mini feature " Yossi & Jagger " ( 2002 ) . This comparative epic , at 1hr 53 minutes , is another fine romantic drama in which we must deal with tragedy as well as celebrate the beauty and joy in life . Westerners , especially urban gay men like myself , need to be moved outside our safety zone and be informed of the real life and death struggle elsewhere to be able to love with equity . While " Yossi & Jagger " focused on a pair of gay lovers in the closeted confines of Israeli military service , " Ha Buah " is centred on a group of civilian friends , both straight and gay , who share a unit in the heart of Israel 's generally gay-tolerant , but not always gay-friendly , capital Tel Aviv . " Ha Buah " opens with a dramatic border check point scene in which Noam ( Ohad Knoller  Yossi from " Yossi & Jagger " ) first meets handsome young Arab Ashraf ( Yousef Sweid ) . Romance soon blooms  but in that political climate opportunities would have to be seized quickly or lost altogether . From there we follow an intricate interplay among the members and lovers of the housemates and the unavoidable effect of Ashraf 's very conservative family . If you follow this film 's dialogue attentively enough then you will have no reason to be disappointed with the ending . The soundtrack for " Ha Buah " is vibrant and the visuals are both beautiful and stark  i . e . real life in the Middle East . The English subtitles are very easy to follow and you quickly relax and appreciate world cinema at its best .  
  What ever happened to Michael Keaton ? What a great actor and he proves it in this movie . This movie is actually FUNNY ! And the reason why this movie is funny is for two reasons : an excellent script and Michael Keaton . This movie is one of the funniest comedies in the history of Hollywood . This movie is the ultimate spoof of gangster movies . In this movie , Hollywood actually pokes fun at itself by using the the gangster movie genre as the basis for a truly original comedy . The rest of the cast is funny too , especially the supporting cast . If you like to laugh and want to watch a movie that contains nonstop humor , then this movie is for you .  
  If this movie proves only one thing , it 's that Keaton is , was and always will be a comic at heart , even when dodging bullets , heading for the electric chair and getting at the wrong end of an information line in prison . But " Johnny Dangerously " goes on to prove even more . In the ' 80s , the ZAZ boys ( Zucker , Abrahams , Zucker ) were the pinnacle in the world of genre spoofs . But there were several pretenders to the throne . This time , Amy ( " Fast Times at Ridgement High " ) Heckerling tries her hand , with an amazing amount of television writers behind the script ( go and check ) . This slap-happy slapstick spoof of the 1930 's cops-and - " gag " sters movies throws just about every cliche for a loop and even adds a few cliches that didn't exist way back when . And not only is the ever-dependable Keaton on hand as the Johnny of the title , but so are such funny guys and dolls as Piscopo , Henner , Stapleton , Boyle , Dunne , DeVito , Walston and just about every other actor in Hollywood that happened to walk into the immediate vicinity . You 'd be surprised by how many faces you 'll recognize . I know I was . And the jokes ? Well , when they start out , they come at you fast and furious , like a machine gun . There are too many to count in the beginning , topped off with a crazy theme song by Weird Al Yankovic . But you have to watch for when they reload . And they have to reload a little too often . Everyone tries , they seem to be having fun and I was laughing a good amount of the time . In the end , though , there was plenty of time to think about how certain scenes could have been funnier - not usually the best thing to think about after watching a comedy . But for a slow night when there 's nothing good on TV , pop in " Johnny " and be ready for some " Dangerously " serious laughter . Eight stars . Check out " Johnny Dangerously " .. don't be a " bastidge " .  
  This movie is utterly hilarious . Its cast clicks immediately with frame one and takes us on a wonderful ride through spoofing gangster films . The conflict of brother vs . brother appears when Johnny 's brother becomes a do-gooder D.A. However , the best character is Johnny 's crimelord rival , the overly accented Moroni . As Johnny says " That man should be arrested for butchering the English language . " Check it out on video . It 's worth a look .  
  Sure it may not be a classic but it 's one full of classic lines . One of the few movies my friends and I quote from all the time and this is fifteen years later ( Maybe it was on Cinemax one too many times ! ) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie-he can't seem to figure out how to play it - but he 's surrounded by a fantastic cast who know exactly how to play this spoof . Looking for a movie to cheer you up ? This is it but rent it with friends-it 'll make it even better .  
  Trapped : buried alive brings us to a resort that has just opened , and is soon to close . We start with a guy in gear blowing up drifts , to avoid the possibility of avalanches . somehow , that doesn't make sense . anyways , he 's about to blow away one particularly big one , when he notices the resort is open . despite his best efforts , higher authority tells him his day is over . soon , as everyone expects , an avalanche hits . Look , i 'm not gonna reveal any more , all i can say is this was a B-movie designed for the family channel ( which i just saw it on , and the fact it had no commercials proves it 's a B-movie ) anyways , it 's a pretty decent film , but it 's partially unreal . firsthand , when people are buried by ice and snow , they 're buried . not just traced by powder . or , what about a CD for a screwdriver ? it 's not possible . and finally , what i can't stress enough , is that an explosion cannot stop a avalanche , guaranteed . furthermore , it 's worth a rental or a TV viewing , but not owning . 7/10 . The movie is rated PG , but maybe it should have received something a little more strong . a boy nearly loses his foot in an elevator , but his leg is cut around the ankle , a guy is toasted by electricity and diesel , and in the weight room , dead people are laying around . enjoy .  
  This movie was well done in all respects . The acting is superb along with the fine audio soundtrack which I purchased because it was so moving . It is my all time favorite movie ahead of eastwoods " white hunter , black heart " . This movie is simply the best . cheers Zuf  
  If it 's action and adventure you want in a movie , then you 'd be best advised to look elsewhere . On the other hand , if it 's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with that mood , check out " The Straight Story . " Richard Farnsworth puts on a compelling performance as the gentle and gentlemanly Alvin Straight , in this true story of Alvin 's journey on a riding mower across three states to see his estranged brother who has had a stroke . Farnsworth is perfect in this role , as he travels his long and winding road , making friends of strangers and doling out lots of grandfatherly type advice about family along the way . The story moves along as slowly as the riding mower , but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching , waiting for the next life lesson Alvin 's going to offer . Stretch out on the couch , relax and enjoy . It 's the only way to watch this very good movie , which rates a 7/10 in my book .  
  Enjoyed the movie very much . Certainly will leave the audience wanting to know more , and there is truly a lot more historically to find out ! Did the production team fall to the temptation of over dramatization , particularly of the shooting event ? There is a ton of interesting accurate material hinted at ? Prince Albert 's contribution to UK and the monarchy warrants a movie on it 's own but granted that was apparently not part of the intention here . The costumes and sets are especially good but am I alone in thinking that this production ( which judging by the length of titles at the end was certainly not a cheap one ) wanted badly for a British Court historical etiquette expert beyond the Duchess of York ? i . e . Did Princess Victoria really stuff an entire truffle / rissole ( ? ) into her mouth while speaking to the Prime Minister in the company of His Majesty with her mouth full ? ' Could never really felt that sympathetic to Victoriain this movie , or indeed in her shoes at all . Yet loved the casting of the principals , whose acting was convincing , so did the script really allow us to really get to know them well ? I always felt like a totally detached , uninformed outside observer , much more so than with " Mrs . Brown " or even " The Queen " . Yet to be honest I still could not take my eyes off the screen , except that is for some of the more avant-garde camera techniques which were distracting from time to time .  
  ' The Luzhin Defence ' is a good film with fine central performances , but too much of the novel and not enough of the filmmaker 's craft shines through . It felt through most of the film that the characters just helped to push the narrative along . Marlene Gorris could perhaps have examined the psyche of Luzhin , rather than depicting him as a tortured innocent victim torn apart by the cruel motives of others . Adapting literature for the screen is clearly a difficult task , especially a novel written in the early 20th century . This film does not go deeply enough into the relationship between Luzhin and Natalia . Natalia 's rift with her mother comes across a churlish disagreement by the mother rather than a dramatic flashpoint in the film . I felt that I was put through Luzhin 's torment and eventual tragic end , without being given the pleasure of having his unusual and complex personality unravelled . However , this was a moving and enjoyable film but certainly not a great one .  
  It takes a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations , characters and jokes of ' Zavet ' as well as of many other films of Kusturica . See for example the opening scenes , with the remote village in the Serbian mountains , with the low-tech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants , the nostalgia for the good days of the Communist rule , and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the Soviet hymn . Kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous movies , but creates a whole world of himself in the process . This is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case . It 's a fun film before all . Kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about . Music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies . His style is direct and grotesque , we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same . The space he develops melds present , history and magic , and the colours seem to be of a Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema . This is not a perfect film either . The principal flaw is the length , some editing and shortening would have been useful , as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up . It is yet one of the most catching , amusing , moving films that I have seen lately .  
  Superb cast , more please ! If you can catch just about anything else written by Plater ( or starring these wonderful actors ) . For anyone who doesn't know Plater has a real feeling for jazz , my recommendation is to see the ' Beiderbecke ' trilogy whenever you can . " There 's three kinds of jazz - Hot , Cool and ' What time does the tune start ? ' "  
  Walking home after the film , I was humming the familiar waltz music that Natalia and Alexandre were dancing to . I 've heard that before - where ? Ah , from Kubrick 's " Eyes Wide Shut " ( track 2 ) , ' got it just as I arrived at the door . It 's " Waltz No . 2 from Jazz Suite No . 2 " composed by Dimitri Shostakovich , performed here by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra . Yes , I went and picked up the soundtrack from Tower 's . What a treat ! The film score by Alexandre Desplat was fulfilling - there are fifteen tracks besides two tracks of the delightful waltz . It 's not often these days we get a soundtrack entirely dedicated to a comprehensive film score . Reminds me of favorite scores by Maurice Jarre , Ennio Morricone ( beginning notes of track 6 have traces of " Nuovo cinema Paradiso " ) , Georges Delerue , and John Barry . There are subtle nuances of strains and notes from the strings , celeste , piano , and harp . Emily Watson and John Turturro delivered a credibly consuming paired performance . The love story , their intimate connection , is very much between Alexandre and Natalia - his childlike yet tormenting inner world , and her generous and bold understanding of him - a relationship alone to them both . Director Marleen Gorris of " Antonia 's Line " ( 1996 Academy Award 's Best Foreign Language Film from the Netherlands ) gave us a quietly sensitive film - not without its unsettling human conflicts , intrigues , obsessions , family strives , lovingness and respect . The front-end subject is the mind-game and mathematical logic of chess . Beneath it can be a mild tearjerker of a drama set in the late 1920 's . Cinematography captures the serene beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy near the Swiss border . I highly recommend the soundtrack if you don't feel like going to the movies . Alexandre Desplat 's lyrical film score of " The Luzhin Defence " is complete .  
  " Panic in the Streets " was a decent thriller , but I felt a bit disappointed by it . The central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times is fascinating , but the film never really explores or develops it . Its well made and entertaining , but its not as interesting as it should have been . The screenplay for this one is really weak and brings the whole film down . None of the central characters are really compelling or believable . Fortunately , the film is very well made so it compensates for the weak scripting . The direction by Elia Kazan keeps the film suspenseful and moving at a lightning quick pace . There are some standout sequences , particularly the memorable chase climax . When his direction was combined with better screenplays several years later , the man could mostly do no wrong . The acting is also very good . Richard Widmark was always a watchable leading man and does what he can with an underwritten character . Paul Douglas spends his time yelling a bit too much but does a decent job as well . The standouts in the cast are the two villains . Zero Mostel , known primarily for his comic roles , is effectively slimy as one of cinema 's ultimate toady characters . Jack Palance is , unsurprisingly , a chilling villain . " Panic in the Streets " is disappointing but still worth watching . ( 7/10 )  
  If people didn't know who Barbra Streisand was before this , .. ( is that POSSIBLE ? ) .. they sure knew who she was after ! This show went on to win 5 Emmys , & stands out as one the best things Streisand has ever done . It 's made up of 3 acts .. ACT I .. Barbra singing standards from room to room , filled with musicians , including a segment where she is a little girl again , all ending with a splendid version of her signature song , ( at the time ) .. " People " . ACT II .. A musical tour of Bergdoff-Goodman , while Barbra Sings poverty songs .. it 's better than it sounds .. ACT II .. The best part , Just Barbra , musicians , & some great songs , like .. " Happy Days Are Here Again " , & a " Funny Girl " medley .. all in all , a great part of television history , made by one of the greatest performers in the world !  
  I think this has the potential of being the best Star Trek series yet , I say POTENTIAL .. we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas .. BUT I HOPE NOT ! For those that have not seen it .. SEE IT ! Without that annoying " PRIME DIRECTIVE " floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool .. and Scott Bakula was without a doubt a GREAT CHOICE for Captain , and the Vulcan Babe is hot too , ( Check out the decontamination scene ) I gave this a FULL 10 .. it blows away ALL the other series openers .. I hope this goes longer than 7 years ..  
  I thought King Solomon 's Mines was beautifully done . My only reservation was Alison Doody . Her acting was superb but her makeup and hair was not of the period , and always seemed to make her look out of place next to the other actors . I thought Patrick Swayze was an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain . It was nice seeing a seasoned , rugged looking actor in this role after sitting through movie after movie with the fair haired , fair skinned actors like Val Kilmer , Brad Pitt , etc . He was an excellent choice and I enjoyed every minute of this movie . This version cannot be compared with the 1950 's version with Stewart Grainger . It was a big screen movie and not a made for TV movie . I thought both Quatermains were believable but the two medias have to be kept separated . I am looking forward to seeing this once more , and I hope Patrick Swayze will again look to these type of roles .  
  I first see this film almost 21 years ago when it was an ITV ( before the days of cable and satellite ) Matinée . i was off School with the Mumps and i was totally wrapped in the film . i have had it on bought video for about 10 years and i want to obtain a DVD copy of it . David Niven is my all time favourite actor and i think it is a travesty that he was over looked so many times when the Oscars came around . i also think that the queen should have knighted him as he easily did as much for the movie industry if not more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins . the way the film switches from black and white to colour and back again is well done and the film has such stellar actors as Roger Livesy , Marius Goring and an early appearance from Richard Attenborough .  
  I am a big fan of the movie , but not for the usual reasons . I think Travolta and Winger performed at higher than average rates , I think the sets were representative of the location and the era , I liked the sound track and the Charlie Daniels Band . However , I think the photography was amazing ! Since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and Gilley 's had low ceilings-perhaps 10-12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a " smoke-filled bar " hung 2-4 feet below the ceiling . The Camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors , the bull , the bar , the women , the dancing , the low-level of light that actually was in the bar ! What a feat ! Sure there was auxiliary lighting , but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar , it had to be low-light shots . Ray Villalobos ( the camera operator ) was outstanding ! He got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film . Thanks , Ray-Great work !  
  My only minor quibble with the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN , is the fact that the wonderful RAYMOND MASSEY is relegated to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene . And the trial itself , IMO , is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasy . David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are wonderfully cast as the young lovers , but it 's ROGER LIVESEY who gives the liveliest and most credible performance . French accented MARIUS GORING is a delight ( he even gets in a remark about Technicolor ) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim Niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight . Goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers them with relish . Seeing this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years , I think it 's a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for films . The Technicolor photography , somewhat subdued and not garish at all , is excellent and the way it shifts into B & W for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and effectiveness . The opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story-and Niven 's tense talk with radio operator Hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth , unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter . Truly a marvelous film from beginning to end , another triumph for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger .  
  Actually I liked this movie very , very much . Not because of it ` s plot , acting , jokes , no . I liked it , because it ` s one of the worse movies ever created . It ` s so lame , so bad , that it becomes terribly funny . Some jokes are actually cool , but the rest makes me pray for unemployment for the scriptwriter . " Men in white " are so dumb and stupid , that you can do only two things . Turn the TV off or roll on the floor laughing ( beer helps a lot : ) . I chose the second option .  
  After going for a bike ride that day , lying beside a lake in a nature reserve , spending half an hour feeding and talking to a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood in it , this film made absolute sense to me . The imagery of the film was beautiful and that is all you need . Switch off the conscious control knob of the mind and job done . Reminded me of Baraka ( 1992 ) but with the added lesson of my previous paragraph . This comment requires a minimum of ten lines , ten lines is the minimum not 9 lines but ten . After finishing counting all the lines you realise that there are less than ten even though less than ten lines is all that is needed to make my comment .  
  Yes it may be goofy and may not seem as funny as many high budget comedies out there , but this movie is truly hilarious if you really watch it . Tim Meadows has always struck me as being funny off of the Saturday Night Live show . Whenever he would do this character on the show I would crack up laughing . So after I saw this was going to be playing on Comedy Central one night I decided to check it out . All in all I was farily impressed with this movie , because it wasn't meant to win any Oscars or become comedy of the year , but it did entertain the Saturday Night Live fans that love the Ladies Man character . This movie is also packed with some highly quotable lines that can be recited for years to come .  
  Do you like really inventive comedy or do you love " the wedding crashers " , if the answer is the latter stop reading now . I can't believe this movie is not higher rated . Basically Meadows plays a character not unlike Austin Powers . There are so many inventive moments in this gagorama . From crudity - Leon playing with himself on the porch , the ex boyfriend tricked into eating . . Oh well . To inspired lunacy - clown sex , the Broadway routine , the voice over . Meadows is great as the childish , but very sweet natured Leon . Some great lines " don't blame the wang " " freaky deaky sex world " too many . . . Why this movie wasn't huge is a mystery . Great comedy .  
  The premise for this movie is simple and so is the script : an elderly Muslim gets his teenage son to drive him in his similarly elderly station wagon from France to the haj in Mecca , Saudi Arabia , so that he can fulfill his holy Muslim obligation before he dies . The father is clearly devoutly religious , but the son is unimpressed ; he accepts out of obligation to his father rather than to religion , he 'd rather be with his ( non-Muslim ) girlfriend . The father is stubborn in a lot of things which the son doesn't understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama , although it is often rather irksome . However , like any good road movie there are oddball characters encountered along the way ; for example a woman on a backroad in Croatia who upon being asked for directions to Belgrade simply gets in the backseat and points with her hand uttering one word which they assume to be a place but can't find it on the map . In Bulgaria another man they ask directions of confirms he can speak French but then provides an extensive commentary in Bulgarian . There is also occasional humor - in one country the son tires of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat - they are given a goat , but unfortunately ( perhaps fortunately for the viewer ) it runs away before the father can perform the Muslim slaughterman ritual . They eventually make it to Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican but on a much grander scale . For westerners it is all bizarre but fascinating . The movie isn't sophisticated but is charming in its own way , a kind of National Geographic with soul .  
  This movie is incredible . If you have the chance , watch it . Although , a warning , you 'll cry your eyes out . I do , every time I see it , and I own it and have watched it many times . The performances are outstanding . It deals with darkness and pain and loss , but there is hope . This movie made me look at the world differently : vicarious experience , according to my English teacher . Also , if you 've seen it , note the interesting use of shadows and light . Home room is a phenomenal movie , and I rate it 10/10 - for real - because of the excellent acting , amazing plot , and heart-wrenching dialogue . Very tense , very moving . Doesn't give all the answers , but makes many good points about humankind  
  The opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness - the altered version of the Archers ' logo , the introductory disclaimer , the way the camera pans over the cosmos . It 's strange to think that ` It 's a Wonderful Life ' came out in the same year . No great coincidence : the 1940s was awash with heaven-and-earth films ; but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered , something best passed over in silence , when placed next to Alfred Junge 's vision . It continues to look great all the way through , as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us . I 'm not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general . One of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other . Not so here . Powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if it 's the most natural thing in the world , a mere change of palettes . Both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own . As for the story .. this may be Pressburger 's best script , or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events . Other than that it 's tight , yet with more going on than I can possibly allude to here . Was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary ? ( Or both ? Perhaps Carter dreamt up a fantasy that was , as it so happened , true . ) Everyone says we 're meant to neither ask nor answer this question , but I don't see why . I 'm sure we ARE meant to ask the question . The film even gives us clues as to what the answer is - indeed , the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions . The fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well doesn't mean that this shouldn't occupy us as well . There is , as I 've said before , a lot going on . Consider the scene in which Abraham Farlan ( Heaven 's prosecuting lawyer ) plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match , and contemptuously says , ` The voice of England , 1945 . ' Dr . Reeves ( the defence ) acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment , and then produces one of his own : a blues song from America , which Farlan listens to as though he 's got a lemon in his mouth . Reeves looks smug . Snobbery ? Well , I don't see why it 's snobbish to condemn blues music - and that 's not what Powell and Pressburger are doing , anyway . As the song is being played , we get a shot of the American soldiers listening to it : several of them nod their heads to the rhythm , perfectly at home . THEY don't find it incomprehensible . There 's something valuable about the song and neither Reeves nor Farlan knows what it is . Reeves probably realises as much . All English audiences ( and all Australian , Indian , etc . audiences as well ) know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast , too ; and that while Reeves understands THAT , he is unable to explain it to Farlan - hence the blues broadcast , which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else . It 's a clever scene . One last thing . I found David Niven a bit cold , without the charisma he would acquire later in his career ; but even so , I don't think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began , as this one did .  
  This is a classic action flick from the ' 80s featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles . Set in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything , including the television networks . One of their most popular TV shows is " The Running Man " , where convicted felons are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions . It 's set up like a game show , where the audience votes for their favorite " stalkers " , trained killers who hunt down and kill the show 's unlucky " contestants " . Audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom . And the host is played by none other than Family Feud 's Richard Dawson , who 's game show experience makes him well suited for this role . When Ben Richards ( Arnold ) is falsely accused of mass murder , he is forced to play this sadistic game . This movie is chock full of classic Arnold one-liners , such as his famous " I 'll be back " right before he enters the arena . And he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with " How about a light ? " I could go on and on , but I don't want to spoil the movie . It 's funny stuff ! Whether it was intended or not , this movie serves as a great parody of today 's " Reality TV " craze . Already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers , and even court cases are televised for their " entertainment value " . Running Man demonstrates what would happen if reality TV hit rock bottom , and it is a scary picture . One can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far . Overall , this is a fun film & I highly recommend it . 9 out of 10 !  
  The film was shot at Movie Flats , just off route 395 , near Lone Pine , California , north of the road to Whitney Portals . You can still find splashes of cement and iron joists plastered across the rocks where the sets were built . And you 'll recognize the area from any Randolph Scott movie . I won't bother with the plot , since I 'm sure it 's covered elsewhere . The movie stars three athletes - Fairbanks fils , who must have learned a good deal from his Dad - Grant , an acrobat in his youth - and MacLaughlin , a professional boxer from South Africa . Their physical skills are all on display . Not a moment of this movie is to be taken seriously . It 's about Thugees , a sect in India , whence our English word " thug . " I can't go through all the felicities of this movie but probably ought to point out that the director , George Stevens , was a polymath with a background in Laurel and Hardy movies - see his choreography of the fight scenes - and went on to the infinitely long dissolves of Shane and The Diary of Anne Frank . Dynasties rose and fell . Geological epochs came and went , while Liz Taylor and Monty Clift kissed in " A Place in the Sun . " Here , in his comic mode , he excels . This is a story of male bonding and it would be easy - too easy - to read homoeroticism into it , as many people do with Howard Hawks . Or hatred of women . But it isn't that at all . Sometimes things portrayed on screen don't deserve too much in the way of heuristic attention . Men WILL form bonds by working together in a way that women do not . ( Women share secrets . ) Read Deborah Tannen , nobody 's idea of an anti-feminist . Well , when you think about it , that 's what evolution should have produced . For most of human history - about nine tenths of it - hominids have been hunters and gatherers , and the men tend to hunt and the women to gather . Hunting is more effective as a team enterprise . Men who were not very good at bonding were Darwinianed out , leaving men who have a lot of team spirit . And Grant , Fairbanks , and MacLaughlin have got it in spades . Sorry to ramble on about evolution but I 'm an anthropologist and it is an occupational disease . Did I ever tell you about the horse in Vaitongi , Samoa , that slipped on the cement and fell in the bathtub with me ? You 've got to watch the hooves . Joan Fontaine is lovely , really . Only got to know her in her later years and wondered why she was in so many movies . I lived in Saratoga , California , where her sister , Olivia DeHavilland , grew up and went to a convent school . Pretty place . If you miss this adventurous lively farraginous chronicle of the British Empahh at its height , you should never forgive yourself . It 's so famous that it 's parodied in the Peter Sellers movie , " The Party . " Yes - the colonel 's got to know .  
  This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time . Miriam Flynn is excellent as Bunny Packard . Zane Buzby as Delores is comic genius . The rest of the cast is amazing , and the film is really really funny . A definite satire of horror films , with a zany twist . If you enjoy a fun , comedy filled evening , then go and rent this classic . You 'll laugh all the way through !  
  This is one of the most daring and important of the so-called " Pre-Code " films made in Hollywood during the 1930s . Unlike some Pre-Code films that occasionally dabbled in subjects that would have never been allowed after 1934-5 , this film fully immersed itself in a very sordid yet entertaining plot from start to finish . The conventional morality of the late 30s and 40s was definitely NOT evident in this film , as the film is essentially about a conniving woman who sleeps her way to the top-and with no apologies along the way . This " broad " both enjoyed sex and used it on every man who could help her get rich-something you just never would have seen in films made just two or three years later . The film begins with Barbara Stanwyck working in her father 's speakeasy . In addition to being her boss , he is also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so that he 'll allow the illegal bar to operate with impunity . While not especially clear here , it appears as if Daddy has been " renting " his daughter 's body out for a long time . However , after nearly being raped and attacking this man by breaking a bottle of beer over his skull , Barbara has had enough and heads to the big city . It doesn't hurt that the still blew up and killed her father , but her feeling that she was whoring herself out and had nothing to show for it appeared to be the impetus to move . Despite the Depression , Barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge mega-bank . She starts out at a pretty menial job as a file clerk , but in the space of what seems like just a few weeks , she sleeps her way from one job to another to yet another-until she is sleeping with the head of the bank and his future son-in-law ! This all ends in tragedy , but Babs doesn't seem too shook up over the deaths of these two men . In fact , some time later , she is able to insinuate herself into the life of the NEW CEO and once again she 's on top ( perhaps in more way than one ) . Now so far , this is a wonderful movie because it was so gritty and unrepentant . Barbara played a 100 % sociopath-a woman with no morality and no conscience-just a desire to squeeze as much out of life as she could no matter who she hurt in the process . However , the brave writers and producer " chickened out " and thought it important to tack on a redemptive ending . Considering that this woman was so evil and conniving , her change of heart at the end was a major disappointment and strongly detracted from the film . In many ways , this reminded me of the ending of JEZEBEL-as once again , a wicked person somehow " sees the light " and changes at the not-too-convincing conclusion . My advice is to try watching RED-HEADED WOMAN and DOWNSTAIRS . RED-HEADED WOMAN is much like BABY FACE but features no magical transformation at the end-the leading lady really is a skunk down deep ! In DOWNSTAIRS , a film very much like RED-HEADED WOMAN , the roles are reversed and a man ( John Gilbert ) plays a similar conniving character . Both are classics and a bit better than this film . This film is an amazing curio of a brief period of often ultra-sleazy Hollywood films and in this light it 's well worth seeing for Cinephiles . Also , fans of The Duke take note-John Wayne plays a very small part in the film and it 's very unusual to see a very young Wayne playing such a conventional role .  
  Very slick , very Pre-Hays Code , and still very sassy . I would highly recommend seeing this movie , even if you are not a fan of Stynwyck . She 's funny , she 's sexy , she 's hard-working - and love that perm she gets ! Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as a doozie of a floozy who rises up in the world , perfectly portrayed by a bank building . John Wayne ( in a suit ! ) plays one of her first conquests . The last three minutes are a letdown , but the sets , the lines , the clothes all add to one heck of a movie about rising vertically in the horizontal position .  
  In my opinion this has to be one of Barbara Stanwyck 's best performances . She was one of only a handful of actors , then and now , who could say more with a single look than an entire page of dialogue . And I was lucky enough to see the original and uncensored movie , with the extra 4 minutes of additional footage . Too bad the movie is so short . Lily is a young woman barely holding it together working for her father in his illegal speakeasy . Her only link to anything is her good friend , Chico , played wonderfully by Theresa Harris . Though Chico is African American ( and having a white woman be best friends with a black woman back in the 30s was as controversial as the subject matter of this movie ) , and Lily is not , they have a special bond . And it is not sexual . Just 2 women stuck , or shoved , into a situation beyond their control . After Lily 's father dies , and she does not know what she will do , she is told that she has the power to get out and to get what she wants . Yes , it 's immoral , but that 's the entire point of this movie . Then " they " had to go and ruin the last few minutes . So , up until the last few minutes of the movie , it 's a superb film and worth watching . The " lesson " of the movie is still as valid today as it was back then , and I 'm sure will be a 100 years from now . Women , it 's awful what Lily does in order to get what she wants , but it works . Men , take note .  
  This really is an incredible film . Not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the United States up for its dishonesty , subterfuge , and blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination . Chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice . These filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before . And in the cross hairs we see the USA , once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality . It 's heart-breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we 're witnessing is a tool long used by successive American governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens . The footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of TV or generic footage but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future . Truly a moving experience for anyone with a conscience . These Irish film makers deserve our gratitude . Long live Chavez . We need to enshrine the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit . First phase in this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are , and this documentary does a great job of doing just that .  
  The year is 1964 . Ernesto " Che " Guevara , having been a Cuban citizen for the last five years , disappears from the face of the Earth , leaving a glum Fidel Castro to announce that he is probably dead , when in truth , he has left Cuba to move to Bolivia to live an assumed identity . Whilst living in La Paz , Guevara undertakes an idea to overthrow the corrupt , bourgeois government there . Once again , Steven Soderberg takes up where ' Che : Part One ' leaves off ( only better this time ) . The pacing is more on target , the job of acting is ever so fine ( including a turn by a sickly looking Benecio Del Toro , as Che Guevara ) . Suffice it to say , it 's probably best if you see both films , to get the true story of Guevara & what kind of a man he was ( I had the rare open window of opportunity to see both films at one screening-talk about a long haul ! ) . As with ' Che-Part 1 : The Argentine ' , this film has no MPAA rating , but contains enough salty language & violence to easily snag it an ' R ' .  
  This is such a fantastic movie , a Western about a self-concerned man ( Jimmy Stewart ) going up to the Klondike for gold . On the way , he gets hassled by a local sheriff in Alaska ( John McIntire , giving a wonderfully evil performance ) , whom he hassles back . McIntire threatens that he 'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town , which is , unfortunately , the only way back to the States . The main chunk of the story is about the peaceful Klondike town of Dawson being turned upside down by new residents from McIntire 's town . Ruth Roman , for instance , who has come with Stewart and his two companions ( Jay C . Flippen and Walter Brennen , who plays Stewart 's best friend ) , builds a saloon ( a Hollywood front for a whorehouse ) and tries to run the town 's restaurant and hang-out place out of business . She paves the way for McIntire and his goons to come up , too . In 1953 , Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the peaks of the Western genre , The Naked Spur . The Far Country is just the tiniest bit less , and it contains 99.9 % of what made that film so special without , of course , feeling like a cheap copy . Like The Naked Spur , The Far Country boasts beautiful , on-location cinematography . The landscape is gorgeous . Stewart gives one of his best performances ( nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954 , Rear Window ) . I suppose it could be considered cliche , as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end . Still , Stewart plays it so damn well , he makes this character very human . And the supporting performances are universally fantastic . In addition to those I 've mentioned , the adorable French actress Corinne Calvet is very good . And I ought to single out Walter Brennen , as well . He seems to have specialized in playing best friends . His relationship with Stewart is very touching , since he is , at first , the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man . The screenplay is very well written , and Mann 's direction is impeccable . A masterpiece . 10/10 .  
  When I watched this film the first time , it was a taped copy and the title was / is Caged Terror . I still own the tape , and I confess , I 've watched it more than once from beginning to end ! The film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally amusing ! I have gotten a few of my friends to watch this and we 've had some great laughs from the terrible script . The film concerns a couple , ( remember this is like early 70 's so they are just too hip man ! ) who go on a week-end camping trip in what I believe was supposed to be upstate NY . They have some hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl bemoans the death of the fish and that they ate it ! The guy comes back with something goofy about how they ate the fish and now it was a part of them , and he goes ; " And that 's beautiful man ! " Heavy man , really heavy ! LOL ! Anyway , along come a couple of Vietnam vets , one of who plays the flute , I believe . ( At any rate they are musical fellows ! ) The guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple prove unfriendly , they end up terrorizing them during the night . The guy ends up caged in a chicken coop , and has to watch his girl friend being ravished by the two guys . Actually , by the end of the night , she seems to be pretty into it , and when morning comes , the guys leave and the girl and guy are free to leave . Supposedly the guy has learned a lesson about how to treat people , and the girl has a smile on her face ! : ) Anyway , I would recommend this film highly to anyone looking for a damn good laugh ! It never fails to amuse me anyway ! If I could find this on DVD and replace my old tape copy , I 'd actually buy it again , it 's classic camp ! You gotta love this stuff !  
  A highly atmospheric cheapie , showing great ingenuity in the use of props , sets and effects ( fog , lighting , focus ) to create an eerie and moody texture . The story is farfetched , the acting is merely functional , but it shows how imaginative effects can develop an entire visual narrative . This movie is recommended for its mood and texture , not for its story .  
  I waited until the 4th of July to write this because . . . well . . . because it just feels right to be doing it on this day . In 1924 D.W. Griffith needed a hit , he had not had a big one since ORPHANS OF THE STORM ( 1921 ) . He 'd been working steadily since then but his movies had been smaller in scope and had failed to hit the right chord with audiences . He was planning a film about Patrick Henry when he was contacted by members of the Daughters of the American Revolution ( DAR ) who asked if he might expand his ideas to encompass more of the American Revolution . This movie is the result . By the time he had finished he had a 14 reel history lesson and there wasn't a trace of Patrick Henry anywhere . We all know the story of the Revolutionary War but Griffith threw in a love story with Patriot farmer Nathan ( Neil Hamilton ) falling in love with Tory aristocrat Nancy Montague ( Carol Dempster , a leading lady for Griffith for many years ) . Complicating matters is the fact that Nancy 's father hates Nathan . . . well not just Nathan , he hates all rebels . It does not help matters when , during a skirmish on the streets of Lexington someone jostles Nathan 's arm causing him to discharge his gun and accidentally wound Nancy 's dad ! Paralelling the love story is the ( mostly true but partially embellished ) story of Capt . Walter Butler ( Lionel Barrymore ) a renegade British officer who feels he owes allegiance to no one . With Thousands of Indians form the Six Nations on his side he hopes to crush the colonials and become monarch of his own empire . Comparisons with BIRTH OF A NATION ( 1915 ) are inevitable . The Montague family might just as well be the Cameron 's from the earlier film while Nathan could be a part of the Stoneman family . The sequence of the Battle of Bunker Hill is staged very similarly to a scene in BIRTH OF A NATION with the attacking army , in this case the Redcoats , storming a trench packed with Patriots . The only thing missing is Henry Walthall charging across No Man 's Land to stuff a flag into the muzzle of a cannon . Amazingly enough the battle scenes in America seem to lack the energy of the battle scenes in BIRTH and fail to draw the audience in . Something is clearly missing . It isn't scope , G.W. " Billy " Bitzer 's camera work is quite good . Maybe what is missing is . . . dare I say it . . . sincerity ? The brutality of Capt . Butler and his men is well underscored although much of it happens in long shot or offscreen . Don't expect any heads to be lopped off in closeup like we saw in INTOLERANCE ( 1916 ) . In one scene Butler 's second in command , Capt . Hare ( Louis Wolhiem ) gouges out the eyes of a captive colonist . We see only the beginning of the deed , for the remainder the camera focuses on Hare 's face as he obviously has a good time doing this . Lionel had been working with Griffith on and off since 1912 . A story goes that he approached Griffith for work and D.W. , knowing the reputation of his famous family , said " I am not hiring stage actors . " to which Lionel replied " And I am nothing of the kind , sir ! " He makes a very good and quite believable villain . Louis Wolhiem appeared with Lionel 's older brother John three times ; in SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR . JEKYLL AND MR . HYDE ( both 1920 ) and later in THE TEMPEST ( 1927 ) . As Capt . Hare his wild staring eyes and disheveled hair not only mark him as a villain but make you think he is quite mad also . Neil Hamilton later remarked that America was his first time on horseback and " I was scared to death . " . He hides his displeasure very well though and we can believe he was quite the equestrian by the time shooting was over . Mr . Griffith was very much in love with Carol Dempster and at one point asked her to marry him . She refused and soon left his stock company , after which her star status gradually waned . Speaking of horses , one accidentally amusing moment which had to be unscripted came during the depiction of Paul Revere 's ride . He rides his horse right up on the front porch of a family to announce " To arms ! The Regulars are coming ! " but as he tries to leave the horse cannot negotiate the steps backwards and stumbles spilling his rider on the ground ! I am amazed Griffith did not do another take . So is America a classic ? YES ! Don't wait for July 4th to see it , it is enjoyable anytime .  
  Cheech & Chong 's Next Movie ( 1980 ) was the second film to star to pot loving duo of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong . The lovable burn out smokers are now roommates . They live in a condemned building looking for ways to score more smoke and just lay about all day . But Cheech is the " responsible " one . He has a job and a steady girlfriend . One day , Cheech wants to get his freak on so he tries to get Chong out of the house . Another problem arises as well , Cheech 's brother " Red " ( Cheech is another role ) is in town and wants to hang with him . Firguring that he could kill two birds with one stone , Cheech pawns Chong off and Red . What kind of adventures will Chong and Red get into ? Will Cheech get his freak on ? How long will Chong go without some smoke ? Just watch CHEECH & CHONG 'S NEXT MOVIE to find out ! Tommy Chong takes over the directorial reigns for the sequel . He received some experience when he did some uncredited work on UP IN SMOKE . Funny but not as good as the first film . But Cheech and Chong fans will enjoy it . Followed by NICE DREAMS . Recommended .  
  Roman Polanski masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as Repulsion . I can't imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in Le Locataire , yet both parts of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people , myself included . Polanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters ( Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire ) , starting with some lack of self-assurance soon to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise . The shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since there 's no tangible supernatural element here . While horror movies allow for some kind of catharsis ( be it cheap or more elaborate ) Polanski sadistically tortures us and , if in his latter opus the dark humour is permanent , we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to on the edge of our seats . Suspense , horror , all this is a matter of playing with the audience 's expectations ( alternatively fooling and fulfilling them ) , not literally with people 's nerves . In my book Rosemary 's Baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle : the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat , while we are forced to identify with a sole character . What 's more if the fantasy elements are all in the hero 's mind the situation is most uncomfortable since we , the viewers , are compelled to judge him , reject him while we have been masterfully lured ( " paint ' n lure " ) into being him .  
  I 'm a pretty old dude , old enough to remember the taste of Oreos and Coke as they were 50-55 years ago , when every taste for a kid was fresh . I wish I have somehow set some aside then is some magical suspended locker , so that I could taste those things today . This magical locker might even have adjusted the fabric of the food to account for how I 've drifted , physically and otherwise , a sort of dynamic chemistry of expectations . Over the half century , they would have had to adjust quite a bit , because you see I would have known that I set them aside . Eating one now would be a celebration of self and past , and story , and sense that would almost make the intervening years an anticipated reward . I didn't have enough sense to do that with original Coke . And I couldn't have invented one of those magical psychic lockers  not then . But I did something almost as good . In the seventies , I really tuned into Roman Polanski . He was a strange and exotic pleasure  you know , movies smuggled out of the Soviet block . Movies so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks afterward . Movies that make you want to live with Polish women , one , and then deciding that they would be the last to get it . Here 's what I did . I took what I knew would be my favorite Polanski movie and set it aside . I did not watch it . I deferred until I thought I would be big enough to deserve it . Over the years , I would test myself , my ability to surround beauty and delineate it without occupying it . There probably are few Poles who have worked at this , practicing to deserve Chopin . Working to deserve womanness when I see it . Trying to get the inners from the edges . Recently , I achieved something like assurance that it was time to pull this out . I already knew that I was already past the time when this would work optimally , because I had already seen and understood " 9th Gate . " If you do not know this , it is about a man who innocently rents a room in which the previous tenant ( about whom the story is named ) jumped out the window , to die later after this man ( played by Polanski ) visits . What happens is that time folds and he becomes this woman . We are fooled into believing that he is merely mad . But the way we follow him , he is not . He merely has flashes that the world is normal , and that the surrounding people are not part of a coven warping his reality . The story hardly matters . What matters is how Polanksi shapes this thing , both in the way he inhabits the eye that only makes edges and in inhabiting the body that only consists of confused flesh . The two never meet . There is a dissonance that may haunt me for the next 30 years . Its the idea about and inside and an outside with no edges at all  at all except a redhead wig . I know of no one else that could do this , this sketch that remains a sketch , this horror that remains natural . To understand the genius of this , you have to know one of the greatest films ever made ; " Rear Window . " The genius of that film is the post-noir notion that the camera shapes the world ; that the viewer creates the story . What Roman does is take this movie and turn it inside out . In Rear Window , the idea was that the on-screen viewer ( Jimmy Stewart ) was the anchor and everything else was fiction , woven as we watched . Here , the on screen apartment dweller is the filmmaker . We know this . We know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator . We know it is true that bodies shift identity , that times shift , that causality is plastic . We know that the narrator will kill us . We know that the narrator will leave us in a perpetual horror , on that edge that he imputes but never shows us and lets us imagine . Ted 's Evaluation - 4 of 3 : Every cineliterate person should experience this .  
  What can be said , really .. " The Tenant " is a first-class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full-blown paranoia . It 's an intricately-plotted film-every detail seems included for a reason-even though the plot seldom makes sense , and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner . Therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable Trelkovsky ( Polanski ) -a meek Polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenant 's suicide-to guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty . After an apartment-warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers , Trelkovsky comes under increased , seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building ; the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfu * k on par with the later efforts of David Lynch . " The Tenant , " however , is more brooding and sinister , laced with unexpected comic relief , fine performances , and a truly haunting score . It 's a movie that 's better experienced than described , so hop to it .  
  Roman Polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time , as the mind behind classics such as " Rosemary 's Baby " and " Chinatown " . Probably what makes Polanski 's cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces , he is also fond of making low-key movies that are of a more personal nature . " Le Locataire " , or " The Tenant " , is one of those movies ; a horror / suspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever done . Polanski himself plays Telkovsky , a young man looking for an apartment in France . When he finally finds one , he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant , Simone Choule , attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window . After Simone dies of the injuries , Trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her , to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building . While sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other " apartment-themed " films ( " Repulsion & " Rosemary 's Baby " ) ; this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in Trelkovsky 's head , the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind , and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant . Trelkovsky 's descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by Polanski . While at first his performance seems odd and wooden , slowly one finds out that Polanski acts that way because Trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way ; as a simpleton with almost no life , who traps himself in this maddening sub-world that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people . The supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the film . Also , the beautiful cinematography Polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation , and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for Trelkovsky . The haunting images Polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractive . If a flaw is to be found in the film , is that it is definitely a bit slow at first . this may sound like a turn-off but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics Trelkovsky 's own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm . Also , the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has . However , more than a flaw , it is a joy to face a thought-provoking plot like this one . While " The Tenant " may not be for everyone , those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience . " Le Locataire " is really one of Roman Polanksi 's masterpieces . 10/10  
  Farrah Fawcett gives the best performance by an actress on film in this gritty real life attempted rape thriller where she turns the tables & gives James Russo a taste of his own medicine . A must see for any movie fan .  
  This is the second movie based on the life and times of ultra hung porn star , John Curtis Estes , better known as John Holmes . Boogie Nights is also roughly based on his life . Maybe someday someone is going to do a movie on the life of Tommy Byron instead . The problem is , that the story is not very well told . There are many Law & Order episodes that have more twists and turns than Wonderland , and the director never gets the criminal case going with any kind of gusto . Val Kilmer has two problems - he is not nearly as hung as Holmes is ( and no prosthesis this time around , unlike in Boogie Nights ) , and he is much better looking than mope Holmes . The director does not introduce one single likable individual among the cast . The racist , immature lowlifes he hangs out with , or his wife , and the police don't get much in the way of characterization . The best part of the movie is Eric Bogosian telling Paris Hilton to " get lost " . Having said all that , anyone interested in the sleaziest side of the porn business in the 1980s or true crime shouldn't miss it .  
  Made in 1931 , this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more often . We open on a quiet little French village , scanning the roofs of the sleeping citizens . Then we hear something that sounds like a party . Upon investigating the uproar , two neighboring men are told the story of two men , supposedly friends , who picked two numbers for the lottery . Our star of the picture has his number and his friend his . When he asks his friend , would he share half of the dough , should his ticket be the winning number , his friend promptly says no . In fact , H.E. double hockey sticks no ! is the way he acts about it . So when our man discovers he has the winning ticket and that it has been lost , through no fault of his own , he is frantic . Everyone is out for themselves , looking for this ticket , in something like a precursor to " The Great Race . " Even though this is all a flashback , I was in knots the whole time and got so upset over every little thing in this all-for-me show me the money cash in the bank film . Watch Le Million today !  
  I have lately got into the habit of purchasing any interesting DVD that the Criterion company releases . I figure that even if I dislike the movie , Criterion usually supplies enough extra material to compensate for any shortcomings in the actual film . I read up on them , and I buy the ones which are the most interesting to me . Le Million is my latest purchase , and I must say that I was not disappointed in the film . It is cheery , funny , and romantic . Everything about it is quite excellent . The songs are wonderful . If I understood French , I would probably hum them and sing them all day long . The acting is very good for this kind of movie . American musicals of the classic Hollywood era relied more on song and dance than the actual characters and story , but in Le Million , the characters are rather well developed and the story , while not being anything extremely impressive , is not at all lacking . I loved the developments of the relationships , especially the relationship between the once best friends Michel and Prosper . The romantic moments are also very well developed . The direction is nearly perfect , with several very memorable moments . Probably the single most perfect scene of the film occurs right after the lead couple has an argument . They hide on the stage of an opera performance , and the opera singers sing lines which the couple , Michel and Beatrice , interpret to their own situation . This is definitely one of the high points in cinema history . The scene managed to make me laugh , to win me over with a very sweet romance , and make me smirk at just how clever the director was . I give this film a 9/10 . P.S. - Some information for anyone who has the same faith in Criterion that I do and is planning to buy it . Amongst the Criterion discs I now own , Le Million contains the fewest features . All it has is a photo gallery ( not all that useful ; one might flip through it once ) and a rare television interview with Rene Clair , the director . This piece is of some interest . He was one of the many directors who had started out in silent film , and when talkies were first appearing , he said that they represented the death of film . I think most film-savvy people understand what these directors meant when they said that , but it is interesting to hear him explain it . Also , if you have read the description of this movie on Amazon . com , please note that they were wrong in one important respect : not every line in the film is sung . In fact , it contains no more songs than a regular musical . It is actually a lot more like a Chaplin or Buster Keaton or Marx Brothers film . My criticisms of the disc are not that important . Heck , Criterion has the right to smack me around for making those complaints . The fact is , their people probably spent hundreds of hours fixing up a film which only 20 ( now 21 ! ) people have voted for on imdb , and only about a hundred people , if that , will ever see the film . Heck , if you look at the Criterion web site , Le Million is nowhere to be found . I have no clue why not . It 's something they should really be proud of ( of course , their web site is surprisingly horrible ) . They did a fine job on this film . Bravo ! They deserve all the money I can stand to give them !  
  As I 've noticed with a lot of IMDb comments , certain reviewers seem to demand that every film they see have smugly intelligent plots that wallow in there own cleverness . I am not one of those people . If I watch an action film , I want to see explosions , gunfire and heroics . If I watch a comedy , I want to have tears of laughter in my eyes . You get the idea . Therefore watching a horror film , I primarily want to be scared . The Grudge is a very scary film , in both it 's well executed ' jump ' scenes , and it 's creepy imagery . I 've been a horror film fan for many years , and I 'm talking about the masters such as Dario Argento , rather than directors of some of the treadmill teen horror flicks that are churned out these days . If you want to be scared , watch this film . Way scarier than the original Japanese ' Ring ' ( which I also think is a great film ) .  
  " The Grudge " is a remake of Shimizu 's own series of popular Japanese horror films . Shimizu knows he is not dealing with anything new , so he does what any intelligent person would have done in his place : he forgets logic and concentrates in giving viewers a fun ride . He uses commonly known clichés associated with ghost stories but Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative manner . The nonlinear narrative is not a mere gimmick but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives . At the end , all I can say is that if the only purpose of a horror film is to scare the audience ( the same way a comedy is to make people laugh ) , this movie succeeded with flying colors . I watched it in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see viewers go wild over this one . It probably doesn't play as well in your living room .  
  Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce shine in this sterling example of brotherly love and commitment . Hulce plays Dominick , ( Nicky ) a mildly mentally handicapped young man who is putting his 12 minutes younger , twin brother , Liotta , who plays Eugene , through medical school . It is set in Baltimore and deals with the issues of sibling rivalry , the unbreakable bond of twins , child abuse and good always winning out over evil . It is captivating , and filled with laughter and tears . If you have not yet seen this film , please rent it , I promise , you 'll be amazed at how such a wonderful film could go un-noticed .  
  I 've always enjoyed films that depict life as it is . Life sometimes has boring patches , no real plot , and not necessarily a happy ending . " A River Runs Through It " is the perfect name for this film ( and Norman Maclean 's novel ) . Life ebbs and flows like a river , and it has it 's rough spots , but it is a wonderful trip . Robert Redford brings a lot to the film . His narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly . As a director , he is restrained and calm , and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes . As for the acting , Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprising well as brothers . I don't know quite how to describe Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn 's performances , except that they truly feel real . " A River Runs Through It " is a wonderful film . 8.6 out of 10  
  My room-mate ordered this one off of the web a while back and I finally got around to watching it . It is gross . It is cheezy . It is pretty dumb .. but it is also a lot of fun . I mean , this was the most fun we have had watching a movie like this since " City Of The Walking Dead " ages ago . It was like being at the old Drive-In Theater again ! You could tell the guy who made this movie liked all the horrible dubbed zombie movies . This one has all the cliches and tricks from those films rolled into one , and it 's neat because it is SUPPOSE to be like that . The cheeze factor is high , the gore flows and the laughs roll ! The effects go from sloppy to good , with the one where the guy gets torn in half and the one where a guy gets his heart shoved through his chest both being excellent ! The acting goes from terrible to actually pretty good . There is not much plot , just lots and lots of gore . This one is patterned after the zombie movies from Italy and Spain I think , because they linger on the gross scenes forever , like this movie . If you like Troma movies , cheezy B-grade stuff , then you can do no wrong watching this one . A nice way to waste a Friday night !  
  I originally reviewed this film on Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago , and blasted it . I believe I called it " wretched " and a " turkey . " Okay , well , by most standards , it 's still a turkey . It 's got almost no production values , what little plot there is makes almost no sense , and the acting is on the level of a third-grade play . That said , this has really grown on me over the years as a sort of camp classic . In fact , all of director Todd Sheets ' films have had this effect . They 're almost like Ed Wood in that regard : Watch them over and over and pick out the flubbed lines , continuity errors ( same zombie , two different locations ! ) , and other flaws . I 'll say this : Sheets is a very nice guy , and while this , one of his first productions , isn't that great , he has gotten better . And I must add that the only really decent actor / actress in the film is Kasey Rousch , though I may be biased , as I attended school with her .  
  Just got my copy of this DVD two disc set and while not perfect , I found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time . I have to say right up front that I am a huge fan of Zombie movies , and I truly think that the fine people who made these films must be too . I also have a soft spot for people who are trying , sometimes against all odds , to live a dream . And again , these people are doing it . Is this some award-winning collection of amazing film ? No . Not even close . But for what they do on their meager budgets , these films should be recommended . For me , the bottom line is always , was I entertained ? Did I have a good time with this movie ? And here the answer to both was " Yes . " The first in the series is also the most raw . It opens with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility and people melt down or something . Cut to some years later and a new housing community is built over the old reactor site . Some kids making a video fall into a hole and find themselves trapped in the bottom levels of the facility . They get rescued , but the hole is not sealed and the people from the opening start lumbering out of the hole . Soon , the whole town is overtaken by the undead . And these zombies are fun . They go from cool rot makeup to the cheapest slap on white-face ever , but they are fun . The whole movie culminates in a showdown between the final survivors of the area and the undead , with our heroes going into the reactor 's lower levels to take out the flesh eating zombies and seal the hole forever ! Pretty cheesy , but I think it was meant to be . Still , it moves very fast , has buckets of gruesome effects and really tries to have some style . The acting is uneven , but a few good performances shine through and one really should listen to the commentary track . I went back and watched it again with that on and found it to be a good bit of information on the trials and fun that the crew and cast experienced on the movie . Director Todd Sheets seems pretty proud of this , his first film , but also has no delusions . He knows it 's a trashy zombie movie , but he does show respect to people involved . Also , Sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field . The behind the scenes of Zombie Bloodbath is pretty fun as well . I felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for . There are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage , mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like CNN , FOX and MTV . Over all , a fun little film that is VERY rough around the edges , but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride ! I have seen many DV films , and some shot of video films , and many are quite dull , but this one really wasn't . While newer DV films are technically superior , they just aren't fun ! Overall , this is a solid , if a bit flawed , release with plenty of extras and TONS of gore and splatter . While not breaking any grand rules of move making , I found the series to be fun and always a laugh , so I give this set a solid recommendation . Todd Sheets was not trying to make award winning art here folks , he was trying , sometimes against all odds it seems , to make fun zero budget , splattery horror and to that end , he has succeeded in spades .  
  The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! This is a good Three Stooges short . It funny and its cast includes Christine McIntyre , Symona Boniface , Gino Corrado , Fred Kelsey , Sam Flint , Chester Conklin , Theodore Lorch , Lynton Brent , Judy Malcolm , Vernon Dent , John Tyrrell , Heinie Conklin , and Bess Flowers . The Stooges performed very well in this short ! I recommend this one !  
  I remember when I first saw this short , I was really laughing so hard , that like with a lot of other films that I have seen , no sound came out ! Curly is really great at " singing " opera in this one , I am surprised that he did not consider a career as a professional singer , because he was really good ! If you noticed , this was filmed near the end of Curly 's career as a Stooge , you could really tell he had changed , because he had lost weight and was thinner , his voice was deepening , his face was getting lined with wrinkles , though he still could pull it off , he looked like he was fifty at the age of forty . This was because he was suffering many minor strokes before his big one that ended his career . Be he still managed to pull it off in his last ones ! If you don't mind the fact that Curly was really getting very ill at this point , this is actually one of their funniest shorts . I know that I didn't mind the fact that Curly was really changing , because I still thought that he was great ! 10/10  
  One of the more sensible comedies to hit the Hindi film screens . A remake of Priyadarshans 80s Malayalam hit Boeing Boeing , which in turn was a remake of the 60s Hollywoon hit of the same name , Garam Masala elevates the standard of comedies in Hindi Cinema . Akshay Kumar has once again proved his is one of the best super stars of Hindi cinema who can do comedy . He has combined well with the new hunk John Abraham . However John still remains in Akshays shadows and fails to rise to the occasion . The new gals are cute and do complete justice to their roles . A must watch comedy . Leave your brains away and laugh for 2 hrs ! After all laughter is the best medicine ! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !  
  One of the things about the film that warmed my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene . I have occasionally carried out my times of dry fly fishing , having tied my own flies , and being accompanied by my brother and my father we spend a day on one river or another seeking to tempt the ever elusive Brown Trout to rise and take the fly that has been offered to them . When we had occasions like this any differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and the surroundings of the place we were in . This was one of the amazing things that was portrayed to me in the film as the minister and his two sons , Norman and Pauly carried out the ritual . For there is something ritualistic about fly fishing as there is something ritualistic about so many pastimes . You can't just start casting your fishing line and hope for the best . You have to attune yourself to the place you are in , you have to scan the surface of the water considering how it is flowing and where the best point might be to place your fly and , depending on your skill level , you might even get your fly to land there long enough for a fish to take note of it and strike . The ' Art of Fly-fishing ' was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists . The title for the film could not be more aptly chosen , for the river did in fact run through the life of father and two sons . This film however spreads itself broader than the family and community in Montana , by the the Blackfoot river , where the film is played out . It has the capacity to draw you in , to enthrall you , to capture you , as the history of the family , community and period is unfolded . The Story told is not just a family history , but a history of Life . What may be classified as a ' River of Life '  
  This movie needs to be put on DVD . It was so funny and I loved it . Really , really cute and funny . Not realistic , but not suppose to be . The only thing I did not like about it was the girl relying on the guy too much . It represents the time period way of thinking though . I have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has been unavailable for US format only in the UK and will not play on US DVD players . It is sadly an over looked Classic film ! Believe it or not , but this film could easily become a cult favorite , for all ages . Too bad , we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own . Lindy is unsinkable , a positive character that makes lemonade out of lemons . She is funny and charming . She stole the show !  
  Some of the posters seem less than gruntled because this is neither Mark Twain nor Rodgers and Hart but clearly it doesn't pretend to be either . You 'll look a long time to find a greater Rodgers and Hart fan than me but Burke and Van Heusen weren't exactly chopped liver in addition to which they knew Der Bingle inside out and tailored some great songs - But Beautiful , Moonlight Becomes You , It 's Always You , The Day After Forever , etc - to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine - and unfairly neglected - ballad , Once And For Always , plus a couple of upbeat philosophy-lite entries in If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon and Busy Doing Nothing . The flimsy plot isn't meant to be taken seriously - why else make Merlin a heavy when in most , if not all , of the other versions he is more a friend / mentor to Arthur - so if you start wondering aloud why Sir Lancelot who has been sold to historians as the epitome of chivalry and uprightness metamorphoses into a schoolyard bully you 're not going to get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie . On balance it does what it sets out to do , entertain , so good luck to it .  
  Undoubtedly the best heavy metal horror item made in the manically headbangin ' 80 's , which admittedly doesn't sound like much considering how utterly abysmal many other entries in this odd little fright film sub-genre like " Hard Rock Zombies , " " Blood Tracks , " " Terror on Tour , " and the especially ungodly Jon-Mikl Thor-starring stinker " Rock'n'Roll Nightmare " tended to be . That aside , this one still deserves props for downplaying the excessive splatter and needlessly flashy special f / x razzle-dazzle in favor of focusing on adolescent high school characters who are depicted with greater acuity and plausibility than the norm for a mid-80 's teen-targeted scarefest . Moreover , the film 's pointed sardonic parodying of both ridiculously overblown 80 's heavy metal stupidity and the nauseating self-righteousness of the uptight killjoy conservative stiffs who claimed it was the devil 's music are very clever and on the money funny ( famed Greed Decade heavy metal god Ozzy Osbourne has a hilarious bit as a smarmy anti-metal TV evangelist ! ) . Marc Price ( the hopelessly dweeby Skippy on " Family Ties " ) gives a surprisingly strong and winning performance as Eddie " Ragman " Weinbauer , a geeky , socially awkward and severely persecuted heavy metal aficionado who 's constantly picked on by the stuck-up jerk preppie bullies who make up the majority of the student body at Lakeridge High School ( the cruelty and mean-spiritedness of the high school kids is nailed with painfully credible accuracy ) . Eddie 's life takes a turn for the worse when his rock star idol Sammi Curr ( an impressively whacked-out portrayal by Tony Fields ) perishes in a hotel fire . Hip local disc jockey Nuke ( KISS front-man Gene Simmons in a cool cameo ) hooks Eddie up with Sammi 's final , unreleased album , which when played backwards resurrects Curr 's malevolent spirit back from the dead . Sammi encourages Eddie to sic him on all the vile scumbags who make poor Eddie 's life the proverbial living hell , only to have meek Eddie prove to be a most reluctant would-be accomplice . It 's up to Eddie , assisted by token nice girl Leslie Graham ( likeably essayed by the lovely Lisa Orgolini ) , to stop Sammi before things get too out of hand . Ably directed with commendable thoughtfulness and sensitivity by character actor Charles Martin Smith ( who also briefly appears as a nerdy school teacher ) , smartly written by Michael S . Murphy , Joel Soisson , and Rhet Topham , and capably acted by a uniformly up-to-snuff cast , this surefire sleeper even comes complete with a handful of nifty " jump " moments ( an outrageous attack in the back of a car by a grotesquely lecherous long-tongued mutant thingie rates as the definite highlight ) , a rousing " Carrie " - style high school dance slaughter sequence , a neatly utilized Halloween setting , revenge being correctly shown as a truly ugly business , and a solid central message that you shouldn't make a particular over-hyped person your hero strictly because of the calculated anti-establishment posturing said fellow does to qualify for that special status .  
  I first saw this film as a teenager . It was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world . Trick Or Treat has every element for a movie that rocks . With a cast that features Skippy from Family Ties , Gene Simmons of Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne as a Preacher , how can you go wrong ? Backwards evil messages played on vinyl ! Yes thats right , they use records in this movie . In one scene Eddie ( Skippy ) is listening to a message from the evil rockstar on his record player when things begin to get scary . Monsters start to come out of his speakers and his stereo becomes possessed . As a teenager I tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine . Almost 20 years later Trick Or Treat is still one of my all time favorite movies .  
  When I saw this as a child , it answered all of my questions and dispelled any fears or misconceptions that I had . It is easy to watch because it is animated , which makes it unthreatening . It has no moral bias or " preachy " aspects , so nobody should have any objections to it . It is a pleasant film that simply gives the facts of menstruation in a reassuring , " matter-of-fact " way . I hope to show it to my daughter .  
  All of the reviews here about how much ZP lacks plot , the acting is wooden , the orgy scene makes no sense , etc . , all miss the main point . Let 's be honest . This is a movie made in the heady times of late 1960s and early 1970s Los Angeles . It is a movie meant to be watched while your are H I G H out of your mind on some psychedelic substance . Find some kind bud and smoke up , or get a mild hit of acid . Seriously , these straight and sober reviews of ZP miss the point . You can't get anything out of this movie in a straight frame of mind . Until you 've watched this movie on the big screen ( which I am lucky to have done three times in the 1990s when ZP was quite rare ) tripping out , you have no idea what this movie is all about . If you insist on watching it not intoxicated , you can at least appreciate the ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of Pink Floyd 's wonderful re-working of " Careful With That Axe , Eugene , " " Come in Number 51 , Your Time Is Up . "  
  Before I comment about this movie , you should realize that when I saw this movie , I expected the typical crap , horror , B-movie and just wanted to have fun . Jack Frost is one that not only delivers but is actually one of the best that I 've seen in a long time . Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost , in fact I think he has a future in being psychopaths in big time movies if ever given the chance . McDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements . As soon as that snowman starts moving around and killing people , though , you will find it hard not to laugh . The lines that are said are completely retarded but really funny . The fact that the rest of the cast completely over-acts just adds to stupidity of the film , but it 's stupidity is it 's genius . The scene where the snowman is with the teenage girl is truly classic in B-movie , horror film fashion . I truly hope there is a sequel and I 'll be right there to watch it on whatever cable channel does it . Of course it 's only fun to watch the first few times and it 's not exactly a good work of motion picture technology , but I just like to see snowmen kill people . I gave it a 7 out of 10 , this is a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours .  
  Okay , here 's what I think about Jack Frost . I looked at the morphing box for the VHS tape and I thought to myself , this looks interesting . I rent it and I take it home . Boy was I right , it is interesting . They put serial killer 's spirits in dreams , in walking corpses and inside every day machines . But this has got to be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer . Inside the body of a snowman . I liked all the friendly snowman images littering the landscape , the pot holder , the snow globe , etc . I like the actor who played Jack , he put some fun into a killer really not seen since FREDDY KRUGGER . That 's right , I said it . FREDDY KRUGGER . It 's that level of " cool " . I wish some of the puppet effects were better , the mouth movements could have matched better . But I chalk that up to a small budget . The cast does a great job , there are some great one liners and scares to make any hardcore horror fan jump . All and all , a great story , good effects , great dialog and a great cast . I give JACK FROST .. 9 STARS  
  Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another one of Disney 's masterpieces . It was filmed with sequences of animation and the actors and actresses interacting with the animations . ( A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins when the children and Mary disappear into the sidewalk art . ) I am mainly rating this film through child 's eyes because I have not seen it in years . Back then , it was one of my favourite films . It was magical and mystical , and the last scenes ( the conflict beginning with the ghostly armour walking into battle ) were my favourites . There was also a lot of stop-animation used with the spells ( ie , people turning into rabbits ) , which may be a little dated and silly now . ( Also , I believe that the film starts off slowly . ) Through the eyes of a child , this is a fun film and it is easy for children to put themselves into the places of the children in the film . It is an imaginative film which is sadly largely-forgotten today .  
  " Such a Long Journey " is a well crafted film , a good shoot , and a showcase for some good performances . However , the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all plots and master of none . Also , Western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1.7 hours . Recommended for those with an interest in India .  
  Aileen Gonsalves , my girlfriend , is in this film playing a secretary at the main character 's bank . She has a lovely scene with Roshan Seth in a restaurant . There 's more information on her website at > Having stated my personal interest in the film , I have to say that I think it is a beautiful movie - moving , funny and beautifully filmed .  
  Who would 've imagined - Hal Hartley creates a filmic corollary to Syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style . The fusion is highly entertaining . Having not seen a Hal Hartley film for about a decade , I approached this one with some caution . His brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog . The director 's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life - often in the region of Long Island , New York or in New York City itself - that were offbeat and insightful . My initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a " spy thriller " . To my pleasant surprise , Hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue . It works in more ways than one might imagine . Hartley 's film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks , along with a singular cinematographic style . Moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides . Hartley has brought all his skills to something new - a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana . Truly he is coming into his own . The cast does a fine job of interpreting Hartley 's vision and style . Fans of Parker Posey will see her in full bloom here , still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before .  
  When I first heard that Hal Hartley was doing a sequel to Henry Fool , I was excited ( it 's been a personal favorite for years now ) , and then wary when I heard it had something to do with terrorism . Having just seen it though , I was surprised to find that it worked , while still being an entirely different sort of movie than Henry Fool . The writing and direction were both dead on and the acting was superb .. especial kudos go to Hartley for reassembling virtually the whole cast , right down to Henry 's son , who was only four in the original . Like I said though , this movie is quite different from the first , but it works : I reconciled myself with the change in tone and subject matter to the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first film ended . In this case , an unexpected adventure ensues .. and that 's about all I 'll give away .. not to mention the fact that I 'll need to see it again to really understand what 's going on and who 's double crossing who . While it was certainly one of the better movies I 've seen in some time , it suffers like many sequels with its ending , as it appears that Hartley is planning a third now and the film leaves you hanging . I 'll be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 ( ' Henry Grim ' ? ) in 2017 .  
  Musically speaking Irving Berlin gave Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers another pluperfect musical after Top Hat if that was possible . Although in this case like that Jerome Kern confection Roberta that they were in , Follow the Fleet retained Randolph Scott with another singer , this time Harriet Hilliard . Randolph Scott is a career Navy CPO and Fred Astaire is an ex-vaudevillian who enlisted in the Navy to forget Ginger Rogers his former partner . But now the two are on shore leave . Fred and Ginger take up right where they left off , and Randy accidentally meets Ginger 's dowdy sister Harriet who blossoms into a real beauty . But Randy 's a typical love ' em and leave ' em sailor . Again Irving Berlin wrote a hit filled score with him tightly supervising the production . Ginger gets to do some really outstanding vocalizing with Let Yourself Go which she and Fred later dance to . But the real hit of the show is Let 's Face the Music and Dance which is a number done at a Navy show . Sung first by Astaire and later danced to by the pair , Let 's Face the Music and Dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen . Their dancing on this one is absolute magic . I 'm sure that when I mention Harriet Hilliard a few younger people might ask who that was . But they will know immediately when I mention her in conjunction with her famous husband Ozzie Nelson . That 's right Ozzie and Harriet . It 's something of a mystery to me why Harriet stopped singing when she just became David and Ricky 's mom on television . Then again she didn't even keep her own name . Neither Ozzie or Harriet sang on television . Ozzie was a pale imitation of Rudy Vallee as a singer , but Harriet could really carry a tune . She sings Get Thee Behind Me Satan and The Moon and I Are Here , But Where Are You , both with real feeling and class . I recommend you see Follow the Fleet if for no other reason than to hear a dimension of Harriet Hilliard incredibly forgotten today .  
  at first I had the reaction a lot of people left with after seeing this : that shots of fat people sunbathing , etc were cheap shots in a way . OK so he 's doing diane arbus meets . . . whatever . . . but it wasn't long before I realized that this wasn't being done in a dehumanizing way , as the images unfold I felt that the problem was entirely the audience 's : we are conditioned by Hollywood and also movies from just about everywhere actually to feel that to watch people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something unseemly , something that ought not to be shown . if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal . however , the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of bricks : very eloquent storytelling , incredible performances , and to think the scene was improvised . that blonde guy is a genius actor . finally I want to contradict those who say this film is all about how pathetic all these people are . the old man who is on the make with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an a OK character that breaks that mold , so don't oversimplify the film by overlooking him . yes his dog gets killed . this ain't a rosy picture of the world but it 's not . . . completely hopeless . anyway I felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film all in all . I wouldn't say each of the threads were as strong as the strongest , but I say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it . . .  
  Hundstage is an intentionally ugly and unnerving study of life in a particularly dreary suburb of Vienna . It comes from former documentary director Ulrich Seidl who adopts a very documentary-like approach to the material . However , the film veers away from normal types and presents us with characters that are best described as " extremes "  some are extremely lonely ; some extremely violent ; some extremely weird ; some extremely devious ; some extremely frustrated and misunderstood ; and so on . The film combines several near plot less episodes which intertwine from time to time , each following the characters over a couple of days during a sweltering Viennese summer . Very few viewers will come away from the film feeling entertained  the intention is to point up the many things that are wrong with people , the many ills that plague our society in general . It is a thought-provoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the whole . A fussy old widower fantasises about his elderly cleaning lady and wants her to perform a striptease for him while wearing his deceased wife 's clothes . A nightclub dancer contends with the perpetually jealous and violent behaviour of her boy-racer boyfriend . A couple grieving over their dead daughter can no longer communicate with each other and seek solace by having sex with other people . An abusive man mistreats his woman but she forgives him time and again . A security salesman desperately tries to find the culprit behind some vandalism on a work site but ends up picking on an innocent scapegoat . And a mentally ill woman keeps hitching rides with strangers and insulting them until they throw her out of the car ! The lives of these disparate characters converge over several days during an intense summer heat wave . The despair in the film is palpable . Many scenes are characterised by long , awkward silences that are twice as effective as a whole passage of dialogue might be . Then there are other scenes during which the dialogue and on-screen events leave you reeling . In particular , a scene during which the security salesman leaves the female hitch-hiker to the mercy of a vengeful guy - to be beaten , raped and humiliated ( thankfully all off-screen ) for some vandalism she didn't even do - arouses a sour , almost angry taste . In another scene a man has a lit candle wedged in his rear-end and is forced to sing the national anthem at gunpoint , all as part of his punishment for being nasty to his wife . While we might want to cheer that this thug is receiving his come-uppance , we are simultaneously left appalled and unnerved by the nature of his punishment . Indeed , such stark contrasts could act as a summary of the whole film - every moment of light-heartedness is counter-balanced with a moment of coldness . Every shred of hope is countered with a sense of despair . For every character you could like or feel sympathy for , there is another that encourages nothing but anger and hate . We might want to turn away from Hundstage , to dismiss it as an exercise in misery , but it also points up some uncomfortable truths and for that it should be applauded .  
  This picture for me scores very highly as it is a hugely enjoyable and amusing spoof of Alien Invaders taking over a town and many of its ' men folk . The town and the players are all decked out in sort of 1950 's style and the whole movie has a deliberate tacky and kitschy feel to it . Some of the scenes are hilarious like with the birth of an alien creature . All the actors give full blooded and serious performances which makes the film even funnier and the special effects and Aliens are at least it seems to me intentionally 3rd rate to add to the amusement . These type of films often deserve a cult following : 8/10 .  
  I loved this film . I thought it would be easy to watch , and easy to forget . I ran out after watching this to buy the DVD , obv not easily forgotten ! The script is brilliant , and the casting couldn't be more perfect . Each character has their moment , and I laughed hard throughout this film , comedic timing was spot-on .  
  Cosimo ( Luis Guzmán ) is told in prison about a perfect heist . Since he 's behind bars and can't do it himself he has to leave it to his girl Rosalind ( Patricia Clarkson ) . Soon there are five guys organizing the crime - five guys with very little brain capacity . Brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are the directors of Welcome to Collinwood ( 2002 ) . It 's a crime comedy that 's often very funny . You can't help but laughing when everything goes wrong with these guys . There are some great actors playing these characters . William H.Macy plays Riley . Isaiah Washington is Leon . Sam Rockwell is Pero . Michael Jeter is Toto . Andy Davoli is Basil . Gabrielle Union plays his love interest Michelle . Jennifer Esposito plays Pero 's love interest Carmela . George Clooney ( also producer ) plays Jerzy , the tattooed guy in a wheelchair . This is a highly entertaining flick . I certainly recommend it .  
  Jim Carrey is good as usual , and even though there are quite a few " Jim Carrey moments " , it 's definitely not a " Jim Carrey movie " . It 's targeted mostly at children , and I managed to enjoy it as such movie . It was promoted in Israel as another Jim Carrey movie , so those who expected a weird over the top comedy were disappointed . The movie has nice moments and works well as a movie for kids . I can't say I LOVED this movie , but then again I 'm not its target audience !  
  I have been eagerly anticipating the opening of this film for several months . Being a huge Jim Carrey fan , I easily saw how he could morph himself into Seuss ' Grinch and make the character his own . I was not disappointed . This movie was pure magic . Carrey is a master at his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did . There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the years to come . I already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video , and I undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as I did the first time I saw it . Clearly , this movie has Jim Carrey written all over it , and I do not believe that it would have come together without him . However , the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right , most notably the adorable Taylor Momsen who was the perfect foil for Carrey 's antics . The set design , musical score and costumes all lent their hands to a magical , fabulous finished product and I believe all involved can be proud . It is not an easy feat to turn a 22 minute cartoon classic into a full length live action film , but Howard has succeeded with flying colours . For those critics who disagree , perhaps it is your hearts that are 2 sizes too small .  
  I thought the racism and prejudice against Carl Brashear was grossly overdramatized for Hollywood effect . I do not believe the U . S . Navy was ever that overtly racist . I cannot imagine a full Captain , the Commanding Officer , ever telling his Chief to intentionally flunk anyone . Certainly not at the risk of his life . And there has never been a Chief Petty Officer as unabashedly prejudice against everybody but WASPs as DeNiro 's character . No Chief as slovenly and drunken as he was played would have ever risen to Master Chief in the first place . Cuba Gooding saved an otherwise badly done movie .  
  If you r in mood for fun .. and want to just relax and enjoy .. bade Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies to watch . Amitabh started off pretty good .. but it is Govinda who steals the show from his hands .. awesome timing for and good dialog delivery .. its inspired from Bad boys .. but it has Indian Masala to it .. people think it might be confusing and stupid .. but the fact that David Dhavan is directing and Govinda is acting .. should not raise any questions .. other recommended movies in the same genre ( David Dhavan / Govinda combo ) .. are Shola Aur Shabnam , Aankhen , Raja Babu , Saajan Chale Sasural , Deewana Mastana , Collie no . 1 , Jodi no . 1 , Hero no . 1 , Haseena Manjayegi , Ek Aur Ek Gyarah .  
  As it is in Heaven { SPOILER WARNING ) This was a great human drama that stimulated my emotions and my imagination . This is a parable revisiting the life and death of Christ . Daniel is a superior gifted musician , who is physically and mentally exhausted by his career , and has to give it up . When he joins a church choir as its cantor , he brings about a transformation in the lives of the choristers , just as Jesus did to the society in first century Palestine . They laugh , they begin to speak openly and truthfully to each other , their faults are exposed , they accept each other , come to love each other , become a vital community . They include the mentally disabled young man ( ? Tore ) , such is their inclusiveness . The pastor , Stig enjoyed authority through imposing a stifling morality on the congregation , and that is gradually rejected by the choristers . When Stig dismisses Daniel , there is a revolt , and Stig is crushed . Stig represents the Jewish authorities of Jesus ' day , whose insistence on obedience to the Jewish law , provided a stark contrast to the new life by " the golden rule " brought by Jesus . In one dramatic scene , someone declares " the church invented sin " . All through the film , there is this contrast between moral-ism and vital living ( being ) . True to the Christ story , Daniel is killed by Conny , when he beats him up , leaves him to drown in the river . Next scene , we can hardly believe it when Daniel 's ( resurrected ! ) body is dragged into his room ( the tomb ) draped in a white linen sheet ( the shroud ! ) , by three women ( three women kept vigil at the foot of the cross in the gospel ) . Daniel is drawn closely to Lena , a warm beautiful young woman who has been betrayed by a man she loved , and who is now promiscuous ( Jesus developed a close relationship with Mary Magdalene - Lena - who was probably a high class courtesan / prostitute ) . Through Lena , Daniel learns to love , something he has longed for , and now finds fulfillment . The solo sung by Gabriella , composed by Daniel , is all about living a full life , in contrast to moral correctness that leads to concern about sin , and what 's right and wrong . The final scene shows the choir all singing / humming in harmony , like a mantra , drawing in the large audience , exemplifying the harmony and inter-connectedness that is our true human destiny .  
  First I was caught totally off guard by the film 's initial lyricism and then I became totally enchanted with the unfolding story and engrossed with the brilliant directing . The characters were all fully developed , not bigger-than-life but just like the people we live among anywhere we are in the world , in Sweden , in Turkey or in America , all completely believable human beings with foibles and nobility . Hollywood could learn so much from this beautiful film . It shows that there is no need to go into every little detail behind every action to bring out the whole theme clear and bright , and that shows the brilliance of the director ! Hearfelt thanks to Kay Pollak and the wonderful cast for this superb treat !  
  i watched this series when it first came out in the 70s . i was 14 years old and i watched it at my best friends house as my dad didn't want to watch it . it became a weekly ritual every Sunday , and as anyone will tell you for two fourteen year olds to watch a documentary in almost reverential silence must mean that this was something special . the broad sweep of the events of world war 2 makes for a difficult subject to document . so the makers broke it down into what they considered to be the most significant key happenings and devoted one episode to each . some episodes covered long periods such as ' wolf pack ' which covered nearly all six years of the battle of the Atlantic . while the battle of Stalingrad had one episode to itself . this documentary could not be made today quite simply because most of those interviewed are dead . the list of significant players appearing gives an amazing insight into the thinking at the time . Anthony eden the foreign secretary , Carl donnitz , head of the u-boats , Albert speer , pet architect confident and later armament minister for Hitler . in one of the later episodes we see traudl junge , Hitler 's secretary , who was with him in the bunker and it was to her that he dictated his last will and testament-she left the bunker after Hitler 's suicide and escaped through the Russian lines . these and many others play a major role in the realism of the events portrayed . if i have any criticism of the series it is that the code-breakers of bletchly park are not included but the revelations of their part in the war only emerged after the series had been made so i cannot blame the programme makers . the opening titles and music are magnificent , and Lawrence Olivier 's narration lends a natural gravity to the script . the best documentary series ever made ? without doubt . unmissable  
  If my expectations weren't exceeded , they were certainly met . " Nancy Drew " works both as a mystery and a comedy . It pays homage to the books it was based on and spoofs them at the same time . The movie starts with a close-up on a book shelf and an animated credit sequence resembling illustrations from the books . It then begins lampooning the books immediately . Writer / director Andrew Fleming seems to realize the idea of a teenage girl regularly breaking up crime rings in a small town is ridiculous , so he doesn't treat the idea religiously . He pokes fun at Nancy Drew 's ability to do anything , such as ace every class in school , know which baked treat is perfect for converting any enemy to her side , make a bird house with twelve flying buttresses , and even perform an emergency tracheotomy at a party . Nancy 'd always be in perfect style , if she were living in the wholesome 1950 's instead of present day L.A. And she carries around a " sleuth kit " complete with fingerprinting dust , flashlight , compass , and magnifying glass . Preposterous , of course , but I seem to remember the Hardy Boys ' access at any given moment to CSI equipment being a little too convenient as well . And if the perky pipsqueak private eye is a little younger than her literary counterpart , it 's just more comedic exaggeration on the movie 's part . The mystery of the movie is handled more seriously . Nancy and her lawyer father move from their small town to Los Angeles , where Nancy digs into a cold case involving the murder of a Hollywood movie star who lived in her new house decades ago . Nancy searches for clues in some pretty practical ways , such as surfing websites like Google and this one and watching old videotapes of the victim 's movies . When she does something more out of the ordinary , you have to admire the girl 's resourcefulness . Emma Roberts , an undeniably cute kid , plays the pint-sized amateur sleuth beautifully . She makes the too-perfect girl completely lovable , if not completely realistic . Tate Donovan is also great as the too-perfect girl 's father , Carson Drew . He 's an ideal father figure without being unrealistically perfect , and he shows reasonable concern for his daughter as she gets into danger . Less likable is Max Thierot 's take on Ned Nickerson , Nancy 's boyfriend . I much preferred George O'Hanlon Jr . ' s portrayal in the 1970 's TV series starring Pamela Sue Martin as Nancy Drew , in which Ned was a gawky , awkward kid with a little crush on Nancy . The character of Corky ( Josh Flitty ) , a twelve-year old with a crush on Nancy , is much less annoying than Max Thierot 's Ned . Amy Bruckner and Kay Panabaker seem appropriately cast as Nancy 's gal pals Bess and George , but they only make brief cameos at the beginning of the film . Speaking of cameos , Chris Kattan ( SNL ) , Eddie Jemison ( " Ocean 's 13 " ) , and Bruce Willis all make surprise guest appearances , which just proves you never can guess which movie Bruce Willis will pop up in next . The movie does fail to live up to some potential . It 's mentioned early on that the Drews ' new house is heavily booby-trapped , but Nancy and her father are done with tripping over booby traps a few minutes after that . Also , Nancy describes the cold case she 's about to investigate as a murder taking place at an extravagant party , which should yield plenty of potential murderers , but she only encounter a handful of suspects . And while there 's some moments of real suspense during Nancy 's adventures , the solution to the case comes out of nowhere , and in the end all possible plot threads are tied up too conveniently and who cares who done it . Ralph Sall 's score adds to the movie 's suspense , but the contemporary teenybopper songs woven into the soundtrack are lame . Still , I really enjoyed this film , and while the movie is aimed primarily at tween girls , people of any age and gender can enjoy it .  
  " Jake Speed " is a fine movie with a wonderful message . It has its flaws of course . At times it 's a little slow . It introduces its villain too far into the story . It 's action is paced at the rate of a snail 's heartbeat . It has a Z-grade cast ( Although I 've always admired the work of Karen Kopins , who has the straight-laced good looks of Sandra Bullock ) . But with all this going against it , " Jake Speed " really is inspiring , thanks to a charming script by Wayne Crawford ( who plays the title role ) and Andrew Lane . Why do I find it so inspiring ? Because it says to me " Hey , why not try to be a good person . " The story is essentially a " stranger in a strange land " premise , that is good-and-heroic Jake Speed is placed in the real world where bad things happen to good people . Jake is more than a Boy Scout . He 's more than a knight in shining armor . Jake Speed is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty , mean and evil world . It 's because of this that " Jake Speed " really needed to be a hit . It has a great message that should have gotten out to Hollywood and then to the rest of the world . Imagine a movie industry that really pushed itself to portray good and decent people . I 'm not saying that we should be watching the Waltons in every theater at the cineplex , but that it would be nice if more movies such as " Jake Speed " would get a chance . ( " Due South , " a TV show about a Canadian Mountie , is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten up American entertainment . ) Sure , " Jake Speed " has violence , blood and guns , but the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person , you 'll beat the forces of evil every time . 10/14/99  
  Methinks the best screen version of Quo Vadis ? ever made . Well , yeah , the plot is not so strong and evident as in the book , sometimes meandering and loosing its suspense among aesthetic subtleties . But the film is really and beautifully " strange " , has an enigma and style , that other versions - with R.Taylor and the new one from Poland - definitely lack . It has the air of Roman decadence , the beauty of declining paganism and infant Christianity . At least I believe it has ) . Brandauer , Forrest and Syudov did excellent job in portraying their characters . Forrest 's Petronius seems to be the biggest success of the cast ( let alone Brandauer who is the one of the greatest actors ever ) and accumulates the very essence of this dying world ( IMHO ) . That 's it . That is the way it happened , guys .. ) ) ) IMHO  
  Jeremy Brett is simply the best Holmes ever , narrowly edging out the great Basil Rathbone of course , and this is probably the best adaptation of a Conon-Doyle short story . A length adaptation includes some new plot strands that fit in well to the surrounding drama and heightens the hatred one feels for Milverton . Excellent performances all round , especially from Robert Hardy , and both Brett and Hardwick fully rounded and comfortable in their roles makes this a superb piece of drama .  
  I loved this show from it 's first airing , and I always looked forward to watching each episode every week . The plot , characters , writing , special affects were outstanding ! Then the sci-fi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining , well written show . I say bring it back , I know all of the actors would come back . I would suggest buying the DVD 's , I am . I hope the sci-fi channels executives get word of these comments , and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers . I only watch one show on that channel now , ( Ghost Hunters ) , but I am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too .  
  Episode two of season one is a delightful holiday tale of love , betrayal , .. and a homicidal , escaped lunatic dressed as Father Christmas . A woman ( Mary Ellen-Trainor ) has just murdered her hubby on Christmas Eve for his life insurance . What begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle to survive as a deranged , Santa Clause suit wearing psychopath ( Larry Drake , perfectly over the top ) threatens her life .. as well as her precious young daughters . This episode is warmly remembered by even those casually acquainted with the program . By the way , this particular reviewer watches it every Christmas on routine . Most notable for it 's escalating suspense and narrative twists , And All Through The Houst is among Tales From The Crypt 's best .  
  I saw this in theaters and absolutely adored it . Geoffery Rush gave the best performance as a super villain that I have ever seen since Gene Hackman as Lex Luther . Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a match maid in heaven . This film also introduced me to William H . Macy , who is now one of my favorite actors . Hank was great as the Blue Raja , and I especially loved that the character wasn't really British . The scene with him and telling his mom that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes . I loved the fact that The Bowler talked to the ball . Some of the funniest stuff involved Stiller and his character Mr . Furious 's false rage , and the fact that his threats and one-liners were all gibberish , and that they never made any sense . I could barely stop myself from applauding when he said " fraculater , Freinken-puss , " was said . But one of the things I most enjoyed was that Captain Amazing actually dies in the movie . I HIGHLY recommend this film for any occasion , and I give it my own personal two-thumbs-up .  
  You know the people in the movie are in for it when king-sized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky . In fact , the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller , and only lawyer Chamberlain has the answer . But he 's too much the European rationalist , I gather , to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreams . Darkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from director-writer Peter Weir . Already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in Picnic at Hanging Rock ( 1975 ) . Here it 's the arcane world of the Australian Aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites . Something strange is going on inside the Aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason . Yuppie lawyer Chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man 's court . But the more he looks into things , the more mysterious things get , and the more interested a strange old Aboriginal man gets in him . And then there 're those scary dreams that come and go at odd times . Well structured screenplay deepens interest throughout . One reason the movie works is the background normalcy of Chamberlain 's wife and little daughters . Audiences can readily identify with them . And when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework , the normalcy begins to buckle , and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide . Chamberlain underplays throughout , especially during the underground discovery tour where I think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does . After all , it 's the picking up of the mask that holds the key ( I believe ) to the riddle , yet his reaction doesn't really register the revelation . Of course , the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now , thirty years later . In the film , the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocus-pocus , but the subject itself remains a telling one . One way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene . A big white SUV barrels past an aboriginal family , leaving them in the historical dust . The terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells . Yet , it 's also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave . Perhaps there 's something about past and future to think about here . Anyway , this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you .  
  The sitcom revolved around a girl who must learn to be responsible for her own actions . As she had the power of magic , she often used it to try to help her loved ones or herself , frequently resulting in literal puns that are often disastrous and always humorous . The program began with Sabrina 's adventures in high school in the fictional town of Westbridge , located near Boston , Massachusetts ( as opposed to Greendale in the comics ) . In the series ' later seasons , Sabrina graduated from high school and enrolled in college , then moved on to her attempts to live on her own and keep a job at the local newspaper . Breaking further from its comic roots , the show ended with Sabrina 's wedding , although , in the end , she abandoned the wedding and ran off with Harvey . Many episodes involve Sabrina getting to meet , through natural or supernatural means , popular real-life musical artists of the time , including Coolio , the Violent Femmes , the Backstreet Boys , Phantom Planet , Davy Jones of The Monkees , Britney Spears , Avril Lavigne , Daniel Bedingfield , Hanson , Eden 's Crush , Savage Garden , ' N Sync , and Ashanti . Course of Nature , the band of Melissa Joan Hart 's then-boyfriend ( now husband ) Mark Wilkerson , appeared in an episode in 2002 .  
  I realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title . This movie is not primarily about the act of " riding giants , " but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport , RIDING giants , to change the emphasis . In my teens I lived a block from the Wedge , one of the hardest-breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world . I 've been out in 15-to-18 foot surf , and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on many occasions . That experience is why I am in complete awe of the surfers in this film . The idea that Jeff Clark , to all appearances a normal mortal , could get away with riding Maverick 's BY HIMSELF for over a decade is beyond my grasp . The first safety rule of any water sport is " Never surf / dive / swim by yourself . " He went where sane people would not , and lived to tell about it . I wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left . In the world of warm water : the first shot of the waves at Jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body . These are not just scary waves , these are uncontrolled-bowel-evacuation waves . When we see Laird Hamilton not only surviving 40-to-60 foot waves ( I can hardly type those numbers ) , but actually working the faces like a fun day at Rincon , I 'm blown away . There is a dedication and focus in big-wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world . This a great film . I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it neglects to mention that there are great big-wave riders in the world outside the Hamilton / Kalama crew , and I think they deserved mention . Splice in Ken Bradshaw at outside Log Cabins and a 10 it is !  
  If you have seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or have any interest in seeing the real , non-caricature , " Real American " side of America then Riding Giants will hit deeper than anything you 've seen before . This film is " unreal " , a facile term if ever there was one , but hugely appropriate if you can derive any form of literal meaning out of it - it is a 100 % factual documentary , but with all the drama of an opera , and the completely apparent sense of love , expert and knowing instilled by Stacy Peralta 's direction and narration , this film expertly leads you from swell to big wave while keeping you completely enthralled in everything you are being given the privilege of seeing . This film is a symphony , crafted as well as Beethovens 9th , beginning beautifully with its prelude in Hawaii , tugging deeply on human emotion in Santa Cruz and finishing with uproar , triumph and crescendo in Laird Hamiltons feats , again in Hawaii . Like classical music ; like Beethoven 's 9th , Ride of the Valkyries or Barbers Adagio for Strings , this may be the only piece you like , but it 's worth it . Trust me .  
  Where the Sidewalk Ends is quite a good film-noir crime drama and is shot well in black and white and on location as well . A copper accidentally kills a bloke who is suspected of murder and to protect himself , he covers this up and blames it on another person he doesn't like who has committed a lot of crimes in the past . But towards the end , he owns up but not before falling in love with a woman he meets who is the lover of the person he killed .. The cast includes Dana Andrews ( While the City Sleeps , Curse of the Demon ) , Gene Tierney ( Laura , The Ghost and Mrs Muir ) , Gary Merrill ( Mysterious Island ) , Karl Malden ( The Streets of San Francisco , Beyond the Posidon Adventure ) and Craig Stevens ( The Deadly Mantis ) . Good parts from all . Where the Sidewalk Ends is worth checking out if you get the chance . Excellent . Rating : 3 stars out of 5 .  
  " Film noir " is an overused expression when it comes to describing films . Every crime drama seems to be a " noir " . But " Where the Sidewalk Ends " really is a good example of what the genre is all about . Very briefly , an overzealous detective ( Andrews ) accidentally kills a no-goodnik who works for the mobsters . The killing is blamed on the father ( Tom Tully ) of a woman Andrews meets and falls for ( Tierney ) . To save Dad from Old Sparky , Andrews captures the rest of the mob and turns himself in . The morally guilty cop is driven by impulses from the past . His father was a thief who was killed trying to shoot his way out of jail . But that doesn't excuse his actions after he accidentally offs the no-goodnik in self defense . He immediately goes to the phone to report the incident but he hesitates . He 's already in hot water with the department and this could finish his career . Then , at just the wrong moment , the phone rings . It 's Andrews ' partner and Andrews tells him the suspect they 're trailing isn't at home . He hides the body and later disposes of it by slugging a watchman and dumping the body in the river . What motivates a guy to do something so dumb ? Okay . His job was at risk . But now he 's committed multiple felonies . At least I think they must be multiple . I counted obstruction of justice , assault , disposing of a body without a permit , littering , first-degree mopery , and bearing false witness against his neighbor . In the end , we don't know whether to root for Andrews or not . The suspect didn't deserve to die , true , but it was after all an accident because Andrews didn't know he was a war hero and " had a silver plate in his head . " Maybe it 's that kind of ambiguity that made noir what it was , among other things such as characteristic lighting . If noir involved nothing more than black-and-white photography , murder , criminals , mystery , and suspicious women , then we 'd have to include all the Charlie Chan movies under that rubric . Andrews is pretty good . He 's a kind of Mark MacPherson ( from " Laura " ) gone bitter . He never laughs , and rarely smiles , even when seated across a restaurant table from Gene Tierney , a situation likely to prompt smiles in many men . He has no sense of humor at all . His few wisecracks are put-downs . When he shoves a stoolie into a cab and the stoolie says , " Careful . I almost hit my head , " Andrews ' riposte is , " That 's okay . The cab 's insured . " Andrews could seem kind of wooden at times but this is a role that calls for stubborn and humorless determination and he handles it well . His underplaying is perfect for the part . Little twitches or blinks project his thoughts and emotional states . And I guess the director , Otto Preminger , stopped him from pronouncing bullet as " BOO-let " and police as " POE-lice . " Never could make up my mind about Gene Tierney . She does alright in the role of Tom Tully 's daughter , a model , but she 's like Marilyn Monroe in that you can't separate the adopted mannerisms from the real personality traits . Did Tierney actually have such an innocent , almost saintly persona ? When she answered the phone at home , did her voice have the same sing-along quality that it has on screen ? Poor Tierney went through some bad psychiatric stuff , before there were any effective meds for bipolar disorder . And Andrews too , nice guy though he appears to have been , slipped into alcoholism before finally recovering and making public service announcements . The DVD commentary by Peter Muller is unpretentious , informed , and sometimes amusing . Anyway , this is a good film as well as a good example of film noir . The good guys aren't all good , although the bad guys are all bad . Maybe that ambiguity is what makes it an adult picture instead of a popcorn movie . For the kiddies , only one shot is fired on screen and nobody 's head explodes . Sorry .  
  A detective ( Dana Andrews ) with a reputation for violence accidentally kills a suspect in a murder ( Craig Stevens ) and then tries to cover it up . The Otto Preminger directed film has plenty of atmosphere but the story gets watered down when the dead man 's wife ( Gene Tierney ) falls for Andrews . He was doing fairly well digging himself into and out of a big hole , but she was just too much light at the end of the tunnel for a noir film . Gary Merrill is great as Scalese , a crime boss that Andrews is obsessed with bringing down , and the tension between them gives the film its energy and drive , especially a scene in a bath house with Merrill , Andrews , and Neville Brand , and the night time rendezvous outside of Bellevue Hospital , that sets up what ought to have been the film 's conclusion . High marks for atmosphere , Andrews , Merrill , etc .. and the general portrayal of the underworld , though the love angle and the simplistic good cop bad cop elements don't help its cause .  
  I 'm a big fan of fan of film noir , and this film by Otto Preminger easily stands as one of the best that I 've seen ! Preminger has reunited two of his stars from the hit ' Laura ' - Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews , for an entirely different sort of crime film . Laura was based around love , and this film is based around hate ; as we watch police detective Mark Dixon , a copper already suffering scrutiny from his superiors for his heavy handed tactics , accidentally kill a suspect and try to pin the murder on a known criminal ; a man by the name of Tommy Scalisi . The plot is brilliantly worked , and Preminger excellently balances several plot points ; but it all comes back down to the main moral implication surrounding our main character . The fact that the film is set in the criminal underground means that the plot is given an excellent base to work from , and director Otto Preminger expertly captures the sleazier side of life by showing the main characters gambling , beating one another ( and their women ) , shooting and more - and this also helps to offset the film from the earlier ' Laura ' , which was very much set in upper class society . The role of Mark Dixon gives Dana Andrews one of the most interesting parts of his career . Here , we have a character that is difficult to like as he 's so cold - but the fact that we can understand his motives ensures that he 's easy to sympathise with , and that allows the audience the ability to plug into his plight . The character development is well timed , and as we 've follows this character and his motivations throughout the film ; everything makes sense by the end . His co-star is the beautiful Gene Tierney , who isn't given as much to do in this film as she was in Laura ; a film that made Tierney its linchpin . She does well with what she 's got , however , and the lead duo 's chemistry is excellent and Tierney helps to complete every scene she 's in . I can't say that this is a better film than the earlier Laura ; that 's a hard act to follow , but this film certainly fits into the film noir formula better than Preminger 's earlier film . The film also makes a good comparison piece for Laura ; as just about everything in this film is opposite to the 1944 movie , yet it 's all strangely familiar . Highly recommended to all !  
  Airwolf The Movie , A variation on the original 2 part pilot , Yet the movie although shorter , does contain extra footage Unseen in the 2 hour pilot The pilot is much more of a pilot than the movie Where as a pilot movie is normally the same ( 2 parter combined ) But the movie is actually a different edit with extras here and cuts there . Worth a look , even if you have the season 1 DVD set , I 'd still pick up a copy of the " movie " It 's still in some shops like virgin , Woolworths and the likes of mixed media stores , although it generally needs ordering , But it saves needing to buy online ( as many of us still don't do or trust online shopping ) but if you look around airwolfs in stores Airwolf was truly 1 of the 80 's most under rated shows . A full size Airwolf is currently being re-built for a Helicopter Museum : ) Info and work in progress pictures are over at http : / Airwolf . org Also with Airwolf Mods for Flashpoint and Flight Sim Games It seams she 's finally here to stay : )  
  George Cukor directs this high quality story of suspense in the theatrical world with his usual sensitive but firm touch . Ronald Colman 's performance , which earned him an Oscar , still stands up despite a few overwrought moments  it 's hard to forget his haunted countenance as he struts aimlessly around social functions and tries to find meaning in his life . There are a number of interesting subtexts and Cukor does an excellent job of making them clear without forcing anything too much . The script by Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon is brilliant , mixing the rarified theater world with the seedy world of the streets and comprehensively utilizing elements from Shakespeare 's " King Lear " as a reference to both the film 's main theme of jealousy and Colman 's character 's obsession with identity . Several interesting things about this movie  superficially it could be dismissed as too flippant a treatment of the everyday problems of actors . In other words if the art of acting required such complete sublimation of individuality we would soon have a rash of psycho method actors stalking the streets . But I don't really think this story 's primary concern is acting or the job / art of acting per se . I think Anthony 's struggles represents a broader existential question , a deeply buried uncertainty about identity . There 's a key , I feel , in his relationship with his ex-wife Britta ( Signe Hasso ) . He says that he never would have or could have become a good actor without her inspiration . And at another point he explicitly states that his extreme identification with his roles began when he married her . I 'm not sure what to make of this but it seems important to me , especially because it 's his obsession with her and jealousy of her that ultimately pushes him over the top . Perhaps the implication is that Anthony put himself in danger in the first place by entering into a serious relationship . Marriage implies a " union of the soul " in the traditional conception . It 's unusual that the male and female protagonists are divorced at the beginning of the film . It 's not completely unprecedented ( Hawks ' comedy " His Girl Friday " springs to mind , among others ) , but it is unusual and probably significant , especially in light of the fact that they do not end up resolving their romantic separation . In a way , the film could be implying that jealousy is another form of self-love .  
  I have spent the last week watching John Cassavetes films - starting with ' a woman under the influence ' and ending on ' opening night ' . I am completely and utterly blown away , in particular by these two films . from the first minute to the last in ' opening night ' i was completely and utterly absorbed . i 've only experienced it on a few occasions , but the feeling that this film was perfect lasted from about two thirds in , right through till the credits came up . everything about this film , from the way it was shot , the incredible performance of Gena Rowlands , the credits , the opening , the music , the plot , the sense of depth , the pace , the tenderness , the originality , the characters , the deft little moments .. for me , is truly sublime . i couldn't agree more with the previous comment about taking it to a desert island because the sheer depth of this film is something to behold . if your unlucky enough to have a house fire , i guarantee that instead of making a last ditch attempt to rescue that stash of money under your bed , you 'll be rescuing your copy of this film instead .  
  This is one of my all-time favorite films , and while it may move too slowly for some , it 's well worth seeing . A corporate lawyer ( Richard Chamberlain ) is dragged into a case involving " city " Aborigines , and this is no ordinary case . OK , a man has died but it wasn't exactly a normal killing . There has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately , and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic & oppressive . The Aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans . This has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about " City " vs . " Tribal " Aborigines , and of course no Abo in the big city would practice tribal ways . Uh huh . Chamberlain is having strange dreams and he is somehow the key to what 's happening , although no matter how many times I 've seen this I can't quite grasp the exact connection . This is a very eerie and creepy film , and is a fine example of Peter Weir 's ability to create tension out of nothing . The ending is a little ambiguous but I take it literally , it 's the easiest way out and the scariest . 10 out of 10 and highly recommended .  
  Yesterday , I went to the monthly Antique Flea Market that comes to town . I really have no interest in such things , but I went for the fellowship of friends who do have such an interest . Looking over the hundreds of vendor , passing many of them quickly , I spotted someone selling VHS tapes and DVDs . Most of the films he had on DVD were rather recent ; the oldest one I noticed was the 1940 Cary Grant-Irene Dunne co-starrer MY FAVORITE WIFE . But the VHS tapes , by their nature , were mostly older films . I couldn't resist buying SOMETHING since they were being sold at 3 tapes for $ 10.00 . What a bargain , as Eddie Murphy used to say . I came across one film that I had heard about for years but had never seen : John Cassavettes 's OPENING NIGHT ( 1977 ) . Well , I certainly wanted that being a fan of Gena Rowlands , and I had heard that this film contained one of her finest performances . He also had FACES ( 1968 ) . I had seen this about 20 years ago , a time when I probably had not had enough life experience to appreciate it thoroughly . And I wanted to take advantage of the bargain , so I grabbed that one too . My other choice was CLAIRE 'S KNEE ( 1970 ) . When I got home , I decided to put aside the work I had planned to do so that I could watch OPENING NIGHT . I was totally enthralled by this film . It focuses on Myrtle Gordon ( Gena Rowlands ) , a famous actress of stage and screen , who , during out-of-town previews , is having personal and professional problems coming to terms with both her character and the play 's theme of facing aging . After one rehearsal , an avid fan and autograph hound accosts her with cries ( and tears ) of " I love you ! I love you ! " A few minutes later , this fan is hit by a car and killed . This begins Myrtle 's descent into herself where she must face her own fears of aging , the future of her career as a mature actress , and the inadequacies she finds in the play itself ( written by a much older female dramatist , played by Joan Blondell ) . Throughout the film , she sees the dead girl , an obvious symbol of her past ; drinks almost constantly ; and receives insincere support from her director ( Ben Gazzara ) , the producer ( Paul Stewart ) , her costar ( John Cassavettes himself ) , and the dramatist . Actually , they 're more concerned about how her behavior will affect them and their careers : flubbing lines on stage , improvising new lines , generally cracking up on stage , and arriving for the Broadway opening totally drunk . This story functions not only to address the issues of aging but also to promote Cassavettes 's displeasure with mainstream movie-making . As I watched the film , I was at times surprised , confused , amused , disparaging , but ultimately involved , entertained , and satisfied . Cassavettes really had a great sense of humor , cared very much that his audience understood what he was implying , and wanted them to be emotionally involved in the story . He makes allusions to ALL ABOUT EVE with the use of the avid theater fan , even dressing the young girl in a slicker and hat similar to the one worn by Anne Baxter at the beginning of that film . This allusion functions most obviously to support his aging theme , the contrast of the older and younger woman . He also obviously uses the contrast as a symbol for Myrtle 's confronting her own lost youth . At first , I felt the symbolism was TOO obvious , but then I realized that that was Cassavettes 's intention . He doesn't want his audience misunderstanding what he 's getting at ; if they did , it would interfere with their emotional involvement . This spectre of youth haunts Myrtle , attacks her , and wants to destroy her . Myrtle eventually " kills " her , but before she can really come to terms with herself and the play , she must reach bottom ( another figurative death ? ) . So Cassavettes has her get so drunk that she can't walk and must crawl to her dressing room the night the play opens on Broadway . She resurrects herself ( helping yourself out of such situations is also important to the film 's theme ) and makes the play a success by giving a great performance and changing the direction of play for the better by improvising so that it contains some ray of hope for the aging character she 's playing . These scenes are funny and interesting . Cassavettes and Rowlands actually did the play in front of live audiences , who did and did not know they were going to be part of a movie . The play they 're doing also acts as contrast : it 's mainstream and self-serious about the issues it addresses , that is , until Myrtle changes its denouement . In doing so , she also improves the work of her co-stars . The natural evolution of interaction ( achieved through improvisation ) between and among human beings , subjective realism , and universal truth - these were Cassavettes 's concerns in making films . Gena Rowlands is amazing throughout . Of course , she has that great face , and Cassavettes ( notoriously in love with her throughout their marriage ) treats us to numerous closeups of it so that we too can feel her emotions and that we know what 's going on inside of her . She makes you care so much about this character that you want to see her work her way out of this crisis of the soul . And this is what holds your attention for the 2 hours and 30 minutes running time . The film is deliberately paced at times and requires constant attention , but anyone with interest in good film-making and great acting will be rewarded . Someone else said that this is a movie for people who love movies . All others be forewarned . Seek out OPENING NIGHT if you 've never seen it . Everyone in it is excellent , and it 's one of Cassavettes 's best films .  
  Dressed to Kill ( 1980 ) is a mystery horror film from Brian De Palma and it really works . The atmosphere is right there . The atmosphere that makes you scared . And isn't that what a horror film is supposed to do . All the actors are in the right places . Michael Caine is perfect as Dr . Robert Elliott , the shrink with a little secret . Angie Dickinson as Kate Miller , the sexually frustrated mature woman is terrific . Keith Gordon as her son Peter is brilliant . Nancy Allen as Liz Blake the call girl is fantastic . Dennis Franz does his typical detective role . His Detective Marino is one of the most colorful in this movie . There are plenty of creepy scenes in this movie . The elevator scene is one of them . There have been made comparisons between this and Alfred Hitchcock 's Psycho ( 1960 ) . There are some similarities between these two movies . Both of these movies may cause some sleepless nights .

  Tho 35 years old , Groove Tube looks a lot like actual TV today ! Specialty niche networks ( nude sports ) , a TV show about stoner drug dealers called the Dealers ( ala Weeds , and even predating 1978 's Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke ) , weird beer commercials ( Butz Beer , no less bizarre than Bud Bowls ) , dirty-minded kid 's clown Koko ( shades of Pee Wee Herman ) , even Chevy Chase doing slapstick humor ( a violent barbershop vocal duo ) a year before his 1975 debut on Saturday Night Live . And thanks to the infamous opening sequence that earned Groove Tube an initial X-rating , I still can't hear Curtis Mayfield 's " Move On Up " without thinking of naked dancing hitchhiking hippies - For similar sketch-style movies , see TunnelVision , Kentucky Fried Movie , Amazon Women on the Mood , Monty Python 's Beyond the Fringe , Dynamite Chicken , and the Firesign Theatre 's Everything You Know is Wrong .  
  On rare occasions a film comes along that has the power to expand the mind , warm the heart and touch the very soul . " LOU " is such a film . I got " LOU " from my wife who got it from a neighbor who is in the film business . She watched it for a second time with me . We were both enthralled . Her as if for the first time again . " LOU " is a magical piece designed to send you back to the moment at which all of your dramas started taking place . It does this while being relentlessly entertaining . Bret Carr 's acting and pacing as a director do not let you look away from the screen . He crafts a character which disarms with a bugs bunny like , stuttering innocence , but warmly carried with such underplayed sincerity that you forget you 're watching a movie . When the epiphany hits during the brilliant climax , I saw my wife in tears for the second time . As a life coach , I facilitate individual growth and transformation , and this film is a " must see " for life coaches and anyone seeking their own personal growth and transformation . It is a brilliant , creative masterpiece with the power to change lives !  
  The men can slaver over Lollo , if they like ( or her lollos-she gave her name to a slang terms for breasts in French ) , but the ladies have an even tastier morsel in the divine Gerard Philipe , who is not only beautiful but can act . Don't be deterred if your version has no subtitles because in this simple , dashing story of love and war , in which all is fair , they are not needed . All you need know is that , at the beginning of the film , Lollobrigida reads Philipe 's palm and tells him he will marry the daughter of the king . Thereafter the story is quite plain from the Gallic gestures and the running , jumping , and swordplay . On the minus side , the obviousness of the story and the heavy-handed facetiousness of the tone become somewhat wearying , and it is annoying that the French apparently consider themselves too superior to Hollywood to bother even attempting the plausibility of its exciting stunts . And of course the non-French-speaker misses the occasional bit of ooh-la-la , such as : Virtuous girl : I must tell you that my heart belongs to Fanfan . Seducer : My dear , what made you think I was interested in that bagatelle ?  
  " Fanfan la tulipe " is still Gerard Philippe 's most popular part and it began the swashbuckler craze which throve in the French cinema in the 1955-1965 years . It made Gina Lollobrigida a star ( Lollobrigida and Philippe would team up again in René Clair " s " Belles de nuit " the same year . " Fanfan la tulipe " is completely mad , sometimes verging on absurd . Henri Jeanson 's witty lines - full of dark irony - were probably influenced by Voltaire and " Candide " . Antimilitarism often comes to the fore : " these draftees radiate joie de vivre - and joie de mourir when necessary ( joy of life and joy of death ) " It becomes necessary to recruit men when the casualties outnumber the survivors " " You won the battle without the thousands of deaths you had promised me , king Louis XV complains , but no matter , let 's wait for the next time . " A voice over comments the story at the beginning and at the end and history is given a rough ride : height of irony , it 's a genuine historian who speaks ! Christian-Jaque directs the movie with gusto and he knows only one tempo : accelerated . Remake in 2003 with Vincent Perez and Penelope Cruz . I have not seen it but I do not think it had to be made in the first place .  
  .. and if you 're very , very good it will resemble Moon Over Parador . This film had a slightly silly story , but it was a fantasy after all , and the casting and the acting was spot-on ! Dreyfuss was perfect as the actor / impostor , full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine actors to have . You get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenes . This was one of Dreyfuss 's best roles , just like his character has his best role impersonating the dead dictator ! And the parting scene : like something out of Casablanca , indeed ! Raul Julia was superb as the Paradorian Chief of Secret Police . He gets some really funny lines , some of which are homages to other films , like " Round up the usual suspects ! " And Sonia Braga was excellent as the girl friend - in addition to being a really hot number : " You should get an Oscar for tonight ! " Let us not forget Johnny Winters as the CIA agent and the several guest stars playing themselves : Sammy Davis Jr . , Ike Pappas , Dick Cavett - all perfectly done . All in all , a memorable romp under the Paradorian moon . -R .  
  Paul was totally ripped off by someone at paramount who made Dave . It 's the same story , not as funny though . Paul related to me this morning about the scene were sammy davis sings the new national anthem of parador . he arrived in brazil after a long flight from vegas , three planes , car ride to the set , etc . he was beat . he could hardly stand , had to use a cane . he was staying in a trailer about the size of my bathroom . he didn't know he could do it . then he saw the crowd of 6000 extras , paid 7 bucks . he came to life and they shot that scene for two hours . he was magnificent , then nearly collapsed . paul is a great guy , though very liberal . a real talent .  
  Winchester ' 73 was the film that moved Mann from the b-movies to the big league , rescuing James Stewart 's floundering post-war career in the process by casting him as a conflicted hero ( although since he inherited the project from Fritz Lang , maybe Lang deserves the credit for that ) . Both men would go to much darker places - Mann with the remarkably bleak Devil 's Doorway , which remained shelved by MGM until the success of Broken Arrow convinced them to release it  but a movie about a man hunting down his own brother as the rifle of the title is handed from person to person along the trail before it ends up in one of the director 's beloved mountainside shootouts is still stronger meat than you 'd expect from the studio system . Great dialogue , an impressive supporting cast  Dan Duryea , Will Geer , Millard Mitchell , Stephen McNally , Shelley Winters , Charles Drake , Tim McIntire , Jay C . Flippen , Tony Curtis , Rock Hudson among them  and Mann 's outstanding visual sense raise the bar with this one .  
  The first time I saw this episode was like a shock to me , it was actually the first time I saw " 24 " . The speed things are happening is amazing , and it 's so surprising , thrilling , and even interesting , it 's almost as if you are reading a book ; once you start it , it 's very hard to stop . From the minute Richard Walsh was talking privately to Jack about the possibility that they have a mole inside CTU , I was sitting 6:40 hours , which means 10 episodes ! ( Sounds funny and crazy , but I 'm the kind of guy which when he is interested he just can't stop ) This series is one of the best of it 's kind . And it 's build in a way of having a few different stories that are being connected together . Recommended in every way !  
  An Insomniac 's Nightmare is the story of a man 's plunge into insanity . Having chronic Insomnia , Jack is plagued by hallucinations ; causing him to try and determine what is real and what isn't . We find out interesting things about Jack near the end , and think that by the time the movie is over we will have a " happily ever after " Hollywood ending . Wrong . This is New York City , the place where nobody sleeps . Tess Nanavati ( Writer and Director ) has herself a good film in ' An Insomniac 's Nightmare ' . A talented filmmaker and writer ( she made this film right after her High School Graduation ) , she has real potential and will be one to watch in the upcoming future . As I watched this short film I was constantly uncomfortable ; between the music , bleak scenery , and realistic portrayal of an insomniac by Dominic Monaghan ( as Jack ) , I desperately wanted to turn this off at times just to escape from it .  
  My Super Ex-Girlfriend is an entertaining movie no more no less . The story is quiet simple . Matt Saunders ( Luke Wilson ) meets Jenny ( Uma Thurman ) on the subway and hooks up with her . In the beginning of their relationship everything seems to be OK , but then Matt finds out that she 's G-Girl . At first that seems really cool to Matt but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and needy . So he decides to break up with her and hook up with his colleague Hannah ( Anna Faris ) . This makes G-Girl very mad and she starts to avenge herself on her former boyfriend . What I liked most in the movie are the scenes where G-Girl avenges herself on Matt . It was also nice to see Anna Faris in another role then her character from the Scary Movie saga . I give this movie a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anybody who likes a nice comedy .  
  Just as the new BSG wasn't what fans of the original series were expecting , Caprica may not deliver what fans of the new BSG were expecting ( for the most part ) . It is a very interesting , if not somewhat self-involved show , or at least the pilot is . If you 're looking for the big CGI thrills of the ( new ) BSG , you 'll be sorely disappointed . If you liked the drama , you 'll probably find something you like and maybe even identify with . The storyline does examine on how the Cylons were developed , why Adama hates them and the origins of a monotheistic society . The writers also manage to tackle humans ' playing God ( s ) ' and the creation or re-creation of ' human ' life . It will be interesting to see how this plays out . I found it to plod along in some parts and too preachy in others , but all in all it was promising . A small part of me wishes ( or hopes ) there might be some minor inklings of BSG in there ( aside from the back story I mentioned ) , but that would probably convolute the storyline too much . Like BSG , I 'll have to wait and see if Caprica grows on me , but it 's way too early to tell . It would really easy to chalk this up as a failure if you compare it to the previous series , but I 'm willing to give it a chance . Overall , I thought it was interesting enough to make me see how the actual series is before ' throwing in the ( proverbial ) towel ' .  
  I have never commented on a film before . I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night . I 've read comments saying this movie stays with you . It does . It 's been almost 24 hours and I am still completely affected . This movie left me questioning my own self . How can I possibly compare myself to a character such as Ben who is totally selfless . I loved this movie . I love movies that keep me guessing and wondering until the end . I feel two emotions predominantly , happiness and sadness . An amazing feel good movie and a very sad one too . I so wanted Ben and Emily to be together , but in the end , they were , forever . If you haven't seen this movie , get it and watch it . Just make sure you have no distractions . You 'll want to see every nuance in this picture . One for my library .  
  Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time . I don't know how he does it . I read books constantly but if there is a movie with Will Smith I will watch it . He has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and holding you there . This movie is one of the best movies I have seen yet . I watched it on Saturday and I still cannot get it out of my head . AMAZING and sad all at the same time . Thanks again Will . You must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie . You cannot miss a thing . Make sure you have plenty of Kleenex and your man / woman sitting next to you so you can cuddle . WELL Worth the money that you will pay to watch it .. don't wait for it to come on TV .  
  this film needs to be seen . the truest picture of what is going on in the world that I 've seen since Darwin 's Nightmare . Go see it ! and If you 're lucky enough to have it open in your city , be sure to see it on the big screen instead of DVD . The writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for the ideas to come through , though hardly perfect . Joan Cusack is amazing , and the rest of the cast is good too . It 's inspiring that John Cusack got this movie made , and , I believe , he had to use some of his own money to do it . It 's a wild , absurd ride , obviously made without the resources it needed , but still succeeds . Jon Stewart , Steven Colbert , SNL , even Bill Maher haven't shown the guts to say what this film says .  
  " Twelve Monkeys " is odd and disturbing , yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time . It cleverly jumps between future and the past , and the story it tells is about a man named James Cole , a convict , who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996 . At first Cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist Dr . Kathryn Railly who tries to help him and a patient named Jeffrey Goines , the insane son of a famous scientist . Being provocative and somehow so sensible , dealing with and between reason and madness , the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films . The story is just fantastic . It 's so original and so entertaining . The screenplay itself written by David and Janet Peoples is inspired by a movie named " La Jetée " ( 1962 ) which I haven't seen , but I must thank the director and writer of the movie , Chris Marker , for giving such an inspiration for the writers of " Twelve Monkeys " . I read a little about " La Jetée " , it 's not the same story but it has the same idea , so this is not just a copy of it . David and Janet Peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story , which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it 's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end . The music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it 's so compelling , composed by Paul Buckmaster . Terry Gilliam , who we remember from Monty Python , as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me , as I really never thought him as a director type of a person . I know he has directed movies before , but I really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent . It shouldn't be a surprise though , as he does an amazing job . You can still sense that same weirdness as in the Python 's , but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing . Yes , it is indeed odd , weird , bizarre and disturbing , so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too , so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through . It 's not as heavy as you could imagine , but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch . Despite that , the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks , dreams , jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part , though it does need concentration from the viewer after all . What comes to acting , well the movie doesn't even go wrong there . The role of James Cole is played by the mighty Bruce Willis , who probably does his best role performance yet to date . Now people may disagree with me , as he did some fine job in for example " The Sixth Sense " as well , but for me the role of James Cole was so ideal for Willis and he performs it incredibly well . The character is very well written too , yet performed even better . Cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself , starting to question his actual time of living , trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle . By hardship he starts to loose his faith , questioning if he can even trust or believe himself . Other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of Madeleine Stow and Brad Pitt . Stow plays the role of Kathryn Railly , the psychiatrist of James Cole , who sees something strangely familiar in Cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness . She somehow starts to believe Cole 's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things . Brad Pitt is so good in the role of Jeffrey Goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date . The insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought Pitt even an Oscar nomination for it , so I guess I 'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing . All in all , " Twelve Monkeys " is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone , especially for the sci-fi fans . It includes brilliant characters and superb role performances , especially from Willis and Pitt , and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that 's so intelligent and clever . Yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer 's attention by making it interesting and witty . It 's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too , so it 's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures I 've ever seen . Through the odd yet terrific vision of Terry Gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride . Hard to explain really , but that 's how it is , it 's mind blowing .  
  A wonderful and gritty war film that focuses on the inner torment of blinded marine Al Schmid . Although it is tough and unpleasant it IS in the end heroic - Schmid 's triumph over disability and depression . The battle scene was superb . But one bone to pick . No matter how many . 50 bullets they fired I never saw any water or dirt being kicked up by the impacts ! It hurt the realism , but I can live with it . Fine performance by Eleanor Parker , again , as his girl friend .  
  I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco ( and back ) to see this movie premiere-and really glad I did . As a big movie fan and a life-long Northern Californian , I was surprised how many Oscar-winning films have been made in the Bay Area . As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Bay Area as opposed to going to LA , George Lucas ' comments about persistence , community and having a vision really resonated with me . Hey , if he and all the other filmmakers can make it in SF , so can other artists . Would recommend this film  
  Though this movie is cheesiness at its best , it is pulled off perfectly . This movie , without a doubt , has to be considered a modern classic . There are basically two kinds of movies I like - movies with depth ( chick flicks , if you must - I blame my wife for this ) and mindless comedies where I can sit back and relax . This movie is a perfect example of the latter . A friend of mine turned me on to this movie shortly after its release . Considering me to somewhat shallow , he said to me , " You 've got to see this movie . It 's just your type of movie . " Foregoing the insult , I started watching . I know they mentioned The Ramones a million times , but when you actually see them , I said , " Hey , it is The Ramones . " My friend replied , " I don't know they were a real band . " I had my moment of glory . This movie , though now somewhat dated , is a must see for Ramones fans - or anyone else for that matter .  
  One of b- and c-movie producer Roger Corman 's greatest cult classics was the Ramones vehicle ( originally designated for Cheap Trick ) , Rock N ' Roll High School . It 's just a simple , technically dated story ( but would serve up extra doses of nostalgia humor considering these were the kind of things that made Napoleon Dynamite characters funny-see Eaglebauer 's van ) about teenagers who love rock n ' roll . Students at Vince Lombardi High School are met with resistance by the evil principal , Miss Evelyn Togar ( played by cult classic favorite , Mary Woronov ) who fears that Rock N ' Roll turns kids into uncontrollable , amoral deviants and vows to make a Rock N ' Roll-free zone . Actually , she intends to wipe out Rock N ' Roll for all students , regardless of whether its at school , and she has the cooperation of most of the adults who might make the plan successful . But not if Riff Randell ( PJ Soles ) can help it . A Ramones fanatic , she has written some songs ( including Rock N ' Roll High School ) that she wants to give to the Ramones , and in trying to do so , is rebuffed by Miss Togar who does all she can to keep her from going to see the Ramones play in town . It culminates into an ultimate revolt between the obsolete fun-hating adults and the teenagers ( in an ending that is reminiscent of Over the Edge , somewhat ) . After the years of punk , when the fame of garage rockers , The Ramones ( and others ) would mark another shift in music evolution , it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous , exaggerated way . It is mostly mild comedy , but a great feel-good comedy nonetheless when you 're in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you . With Jerry Zucker ( of Airplane fame ) and Joe Dante ( of Gremlins fame ) both taking part in some of the directing , you can get the idea for what kind of humor you 're in for ( and not to mention , expect to see Dick Miller even if only for a few minutes in the film 's finale ) . The story must 've later inspired ( and was consequently updated ) by the mid-90s comedy , Detroit Rock City , which some minor character changes in the vehicle for aged glam rockers , Kizz . I would recommend passing on the Corey Feldman vehicle , Rock N ' Roll High School Forever , released nearly a decade later . The original is still the best .  
  After the usual chase scene , Jerry accidentally winds up inside a bottle of invisible ink , which was part of a chemistry set . He quickly discovers he 's invisible .. so the predictable results occur , meaning he uses his new hidden condition to torment Tom . Jerry often is just defending himself , but often he has sadistic streak in him that torments the cat whenever possible , even when unprovoked . Here , he makes Tom think his eyes are deceiving him when cheese from a mousetrap disappears before his eyes , or milk from a dish . Tom can't take anymore so he tries to sleep this nightmare off , but Jerry sets fire to his paw ! Man , I hope little kids didn't ideas watching these cartoons back in the ' 40s and ' 50s ! I always found Jerry , the little mouse , more evil than cute . Thankfully , in cartoons , generally , whatever damage a character suffers is gone within seconds and he 's back to normal . The best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way through when Tom figures out what the story is with Jerry , and tries different methods to detect where the mouse is located ( such as putting flour on the floor to see his footprints ) .  
  No Strings Attached is one of Carlos Mencia 's best performances to date . Mencia is known for poking and making fun of racial issues . However , he does more than that in this stand-up performance , which took place in San Francisco . In general , Mencia 's material does not only make you laugh but it also makes you think about what is really wrong with society today . In this hour long performance , Mencia talks about such things as illegal immigration , what women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace , terrorism , his opinion of Mel Gibson 's Passion of the Christ and an argument that he got into with a woman regarding whether or not he is affected by Jesus , and how society should treat those that are physically or mentally handicapped . Mencia even discusses whether or one should have the right to speak out and tell a joke . Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend , which at many times gets him trouble with his critics . For example , he does go somewhat far ( and he admits it ) with a joke regarding Pope John Paul II and what he is most likely doing in heaven right now . Mencia 's main message in all of his performances is that we all have have a voice and that we should use that voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid to offend . He reminds us that we have a right to free speech and that we must use this right as Americans . If you enjoy this performance , I definitely recommend watching Mind of Mencia , his show on Comedy Central .  
  One of the most provocative films ever with excellent cinematography backed up by Mc Clarens lisp and stunning quote " do you believe in love at first site ? " . A trace of expressionism was evident in this picture , further catapulting the films flawless integrity . Gabby ( AKA Joey ) played by Eva Longoria clearly loved the movie and role she played so much that she couldn't even be bothered giving it mention in her filmography . Lol . the best part of the movie would have to be without a doubt , the heroic rescue by MC clure as he saved the young ' Handicapped ' kid with the speech impediment .. Which i may add was acted to perfection ! James Cahiil 's use of sound effects is unmatched even to this day . The drug bust he performs early in the film is pain stakingly realistic . When i watched this movie for the first time i was so compelled with the intense lack of respect for the Gang Inthused brothers from the Southside gang and the CTM ( Cut Throat Mafia ) . This was by far one of the most encapsulating crevice Cahill has committed to filming . Personally this film holds sentimental value to me and i will be downloading it in the near future . Thats if i can find it anywhere , LOL !  
  This is Not a Love Song . My one word summary of this film would be ` Excellent ' . It probably won't appeal to the mass movie watching public  it 's a film that forces you to participate . You observe , think , and question . Comparisons could be made with Deliverance ( Topic / Theme ) and perhaps with The Blair Witch Project for overall filming style . However this film stands unique against both . The cinematography effects ( solarisation , freeze frame , blur etc ) have been seen before but they are used most effectively in this film to underpin the natural tension of the story . Acting is raw , menacing and utterly believable . The real theme of the film is about friendship ; the title really gives the game away . It 's probably not the kind of friendship that most of us have experienced or indeed would want to . It is a love song .  
  I am currently doing film studies at A.S level and " this is not a love song " is a film we watched and in my opinion it is a film with a very simple storyline but a complex back-story . If you scratch the surface you will find a thriller-chase film of two men running through the countryside from farmers , after committing a murder : - " sounds quite exiting " . However you need to dig deeper to uncover the true feeling of the true genre . As it is suggested , it is a love story between two homosexual lovers , filled with trust , deceit and betrayal . We are not told about this " love " directly through the film but the events that happen through out , for example the way Heaton acts towards Spike almost screams this untouched love affair in our faces . Overall this film is a good example of why British films should not be dismissed as " rubbish " just because they are done on a low budget . A Good film with an intricate story line , however it is definitely an acquired taste and is possibly not suitable for the average fan of Hollywood blockbusters .  
  IVAN ( Marco Ricca ) and GILBERTO ( Alexandre Borges ) are partners in a company together with ESTEVÃO ( George Freire ) , but the first ones contract a professional killer , ANISIO , to murder ESTEVÃO ( the plot , at least at the beginning , doesn't explain very well why ) . The guy does it and after receiving his money he starts blackmailing the two partners , appearing in their company and saying he wants a job there ( as supervisor or something ) . At the same time he meets MARINA ( Mariana Ximenes ) , daughter of ESTEVÃO , and starts dating with her ! In a story like this , where crime , corruption , betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand , no one is innocent or can be victimized , exception made to MARINA , which is the only person who doesn't know what 's going on and didn't betray anyone This film portrays with sarcasm the sad and cruel reality which exists in big metropolis like São Paulo , where crime is every day 's presence . We can feel irony but also veracity in characters like ANISIO ( brilliantly played by Paulo Miklos ) , which does blackmail to the guys who paid him without any scruples , and even flirts with the daughter of the guy he killed ! He really must be a monster to do something like that , but of course I know there 're people like him out there , in Brazil or any other place It 's a very good movie , cruel but truthful , about a sad reality The acting is great and the soundtrack too .  
  TO all of yall who think 1 . This was a boring telecast 2 . Halle berry and denzel Washington did not deserve their Oscars SHUT THE F * k UP ! This was one of the best Academy awards show because 1 . It was a moment in history to have a black yes " Black actress " win an academy award for Best actress so many of our black sisters have been ignored by the academy for many years . To be honest I had stop watching the academy awards because of a lack of diversity in either the winners or nominees . To me it was nothing but a bunch of white people patting each other in the back . the academy had many chances to vote black actresses that were brilliant in movies eg Alfre Woodard , Whoopi Goldberg , Diana Ross , Mary jean Babtise , but it did not 2 . Halle berry deserved that Oscar no competition the academy was under pressure to vote for her so long have deserving actresses been ignored by the academy the majority of which is comprised of white voters yeah yeah Nicole kidman sang very prettily in muling rouge ! but it was time black people were accommodated in these awards shows . As for Mr Washington the academy owed him big time after that unfair loss for MalcomX . To all of you who think race is not an issue " probably white people " in the movie industry , well it is many of the most talented black actresses around have either been reduced to stereo typical made by white people roles of what they think is a black women or are not existence " Angela basset " . I do not expect many of the white people to understand any of this because they never had to deal with any of it . Come to think of it they are the one who been inflicting it  
  Just saw the movie , and the scary thing was , the people talking during the movie sounded just like the actors . The movie had its moments , but also lagged and was rather sick . It was all meant to be a farce , but once you see the pathetic lives of the people in the movie , you think to yourself " People like this are all around us " All attempts at getting the audience 's sympathy are dashed as the actors do one stupid thing after another . On the plus side , there are some great ( and funny ) insults . I think I would wait for video - but it was a good laugh . WARNING - Jerry takes his shirt off during the movie ! ( not a pretty sight ! )  
  I for one really like this movie for some reasons I 'll go into late but I want to touch on why I think people don't like it . First off , there are people out there who just like to hate Tom Cruise . I don't understand it really . Second , Cameron Crowe I think successfully p * es off two groups of movie-goers with this film . The casual , relaxed , " not looking to think too hard " group of movie-goers are left confused when the plot takes a complete 180 at the end of the movie . And the deep , philosophical , mystery-fans are devastated when Crowe has one of his characters completely explain the mystery . This is a good movie . And Tom Cruise does a very good job in it . I think it 's probably his best performance from what I 've seen all though I haven't seen all of his movies , or even a majority of them probably . The supporting cast is good as well . Penelope Cruz gives a solid performance and Jason Lee was enjoyable . I like the story , and I think that 's what Vanilla Sky is more than anything . It 's a mystery , an adventure , and a romantic comedy , but it 's mostly just a good story . And it has a lot of philosophical undertones to it , and many similar ideas and stories like this occur in historical philosophy . David Aames ( Cruise ) is the man that had everything he wanted , more or less lost it , was given a second chance with a catch to regain it all back , and in the end facing his demons and the full scope of what is happening , chooses reality , simplicity , and normality to see if he can finally find the one thing he could never get a grip on : happiness . Many people were disappointed that Crowe laid out the complete mystery at the end . I think it 's necessary . The audience then knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that David is aware of his circumstances and it makes the choice at the end all the more powerful . And the music in the movie is great . It 's probably what makes the movie as enjoyable as it is . Particularly , " Njosnavelin " by Sigur Ros , which is an amazing song . All in all , I 'd give it 3 out 4 stars . It 's a movie with some substance for those who like to think things through , and a great story for those looking to relax . That " moderate " approach is probably why people dislike it so much because it isn't a full blown mystery , or a full blown love story . It mixes and matches different elements and genres .  
  I really enjoyed this film because I have a tremendous interest in American History .. the Antebellum years and the Civil War in particular . I purchased it recently from a rack of previously-viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and I was very glad to add this one to my history video collection . Though not of the caliber of Civil War films such as " Glory " or " Gettysburg , " provides a lot of history on the pre-Civil War brotherhood among cadets at West Point . Maybe it 's the gray uniforms , the youth , or the military discipline , but I am fascinated by the story of the Corps of Cadets from around 1830 to the brink of the War . I imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men , learning how to make war , then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates ! Actually , there were two classes graduated in 1861 : one class in May , the other in June . the movie makes no real mention of this , except to mention Henry A . DuPont , first graduate of the May Class ; and George Custer , last grad of the June Class . the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war , but it was the result of switching back to a four-year course of study , after a few years of experimenting with a five-year course ( I think the first class had attended five years , the other for four ) . As the movie portrays , cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other .. George " Fanny " or " Autie " Custer ; Alonzo " Lon " Cushing ; James " Beauty " Stuart ( for J.E.B. Stuart , class of 1854 ) , etc . I say this film is " Santa Fe Trail " as it should have been because that 1940 film , while enjoyable , really fudges history . Cadets from several different classes are all graduating together . JEB Stuart and George Custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are side-by-side in stopping John Brown 's 1859 insurrection at Harper 's Ferry . In fact , Stuart and Custer were never friends , but enemies during the War . They faced each other ( for the first time , I think ) at Gettysburg in 1863 ( Stuart was at the Harper 's ferry Raid , but Custer was still a cadet at the Point when it took place ) . " Fanny " Custer plays a role in " Class of ' 61 , " though his classmate chums , Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton are fictional . I believe they are respectively based on Partick Henry O'Rorke and John Pelham , two people you can look up . Anyway , I truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid-19th Century America .  
  " I have looked into the eye of this island , and what I saw was beautiful , " proclaims one of the main characters in ABC 's award winning television show " Lost " . The series could be summarized as a drama story about a group of plane crash survivors stranded on an unknown island , but that would be doing the show a disservice . " Lost " follows a large group of characters who come into conflict with the island , each other , and ultimately themselves as they struggle with their new way of life and their dependency on each other . The situation becomes more complicated when it becomes clear this isn't an ordinary island , either - and that they may not be alone . My initial fear after hearing the concept of this series was the lack of new stories they could tell us after a certain period , but this proved to be unfounded . The narrative flows naturally , the dialogue is witty , the characters are memorable and the execution is superb . The island is a character all on its own , and to understand this comment you 'd have to see the series for yourself , which only goes to show its originality and greatness . At the time of writing this review , only the first two seasons have aired , and they 're filled with strong episodes . My only mild criticism is that the second season seems to slow down a bit halfway , but then fortunately comes back in admirable shape for the final episodes . If I can recommend one television series you should be following right now , it would certainly be this one . If you like excitement , adventure , character driven stories , an extremely strong cast and crew , beautiful locations , and an island that seems more spiritual than natural , " Lost " is for you . Just be sure you start at the beginning .  
  I am obsessed ! The story is amazing and the show is highly addictive , but I love it . I am on Season 2 , disc 5 , and I tell you that I am too attached to the characters now . For anything bad to happen to them would seriously affect my vote for the show . And , Michael is on my list now . Kidding .. I am so happy to see there is a Season 3 , because I was too afraid to go onto disc 6 thinking that it would be ending . I can't wait to see the rest now . Thanks to the directors / producers / and actors of Lost .. I enjoy watching TV again . Before Lost I surfed through every channel going to bed sad because of my disappointment in television , but I have to say that Lost is my kind of entertainment !  
  Although Kurt Russell was and is probably the closest person to look like Elvis in show-business , so many things were false in this film . First of all , the makers claimed Elvis opened his famous live shows in ' 69 after a 9 year hault for films by wearing a white jump-suit made in 1972 . Also they claimed he sang ' burning love ' which he first sung in 1972 and ' the wonder of you ' which he first recorded in 1970 . They also claim that he got his first guitar for christmas when all Elvis fans know he got it for his birthday . I know all movies based on past have something false but these things are so obvious to people who like Elvis .  
  Being that I am a true product of the hip-hop and electronic dance music generation , this is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time . Beat Street , although not as " authentic " in some respects as Wild Style , is a film that is guaranteed to tug the heart strings of anyone who takes pride in the culture of urban sample / DJ-based music and electro-club culture . Although I will admit that at times the dialogue is somewhat cheesy , you can't help but feel for the characters , and ultimately " wish you were there " for the beginnings of hip-hop culture in New York City in the early eighties . The b-boy battle scene at the Roxy nightclub ( a real-life , real-time competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and the NYC Breakers ) is just as essential to a hip-hop fan 's archives as any classic album . Watch some of the breakers ' moves in slow-motion if possible to truly appreciate the athletic and stylistic expertise of a seasoned B-boy / B-girl . All praises due to the Zulu Nation !  
  Sure Star Wars ( a movie I have seen at least fifty times ) beats all the others in special effects , but this film has every thing else ! It has horror ( non-graphical ) , romance , robots , witty repartee , intelligence , ( surprisingly good ) special effects , and drama . I saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly struck print , and I was amazed at how well it held up today . I thought the old 40 's style electronics would look hokey , but they somehow looked futuristic and moderne . Ann Francis in here ( mostly ) short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me . The Krell monster appearing in the ray beams still scares the bejebees out of me . Of course we all know that the " Great Bird of the Galaxy " probably modeled much of " Star Trek " from this movie . No one has yet to beat Robby , the Robot , in terms of personality ( sorry , R2D2 and C3PO ) . This movie , overall , is the standard that all other Science Fiction films will have to measure up to ! Honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles .  
  Love is overwhelming .. In all it 's manifestations .. Gorgeous , absolutely gorgeous .. Tudor Chirila , Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu , one truly dramatic story about love in all it 's shapes , a story about the undecipherable ways of young hearts , about life and lost innocence all directed by the skillful eye of Tudor Giurgiu . With a magnificent soundtrack featuring Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche it surprises in every way leaving behind the sour taste of misunderstanding love .. Truly remarkable .. Is it me or is Romanian cinematography slowly but surely advancing and gaining respect ? This is a brilliant film .. Two thumbs up to everybody involved .  
  This movie blows you off your feet . This debut movie from Tom Barman ( known from the Belgian rock band dEUS ) introduces you to 8 intriguing people , building blocks of a compelling movie mosaic . They each survive one day and one night in the metropole of Antwerp . Barman paints his characters with great deal of verve and competently interweaves their individual stories , a tour the force that reminds of the best work of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson . The patchwork of anecdotes surprises , moves , amuses ; the dialogues are so natural , they seem to be improvised . Some great performances by Matthias Schoenaerts , Natali Broods and the extremely funny duo from Ghent , Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt . Sam Louwyck is the memorable " Windman " , a bizarre guy dancing throughout the movie . Sam is also responsible for the stunning choreography , and of course Tom Barman himself took care of the ultra cool Sound Track . We were seriously impressed : Any Way The Wind Blows is a movie that blows you off your feet .  
  " Written on the Wind " is an irresistible , wonderfully kinky film , as only director Sirk could have done it . The movie is submerged in a bucket full of Freudian symbols , weird melodramatics and colorful contrasts . The connection between financial success and moral decay is the film 's main theme . Sirk seems to suggest that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism . However , I prefer to see the movie as a prime example of what Sirk could do with kitschy material . The palette of colors is particularly impressive . The acting in the film is great too . Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance , but the movie belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone ( she deservedly won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar ) , who manage to keep the film at a boiling point . Kudos to Frank Skinner 's pulsating score , Russell Metty 's brilliant camera work ( every single shot is a masterpiece in itself ) , and the production design department . Also , the title tune is a beauty . It 's an unforgettable movie .  
  One thing about Hollywood , someone has a success and it 's always rushed to be copied . And another thing is that players give some of their best performances away from their home studio . Rock Hudson got such accolades for his performance in the Texas based film Giant that Universal executives must have thought , let 's quick get him into another modern Texas setting . Similarly Robert Stack got great reviews for The High and the Mighty as the pilot who was cracking under the strain of flying a damaged aircraft that it was natural to give him another crack up role . Both of these ends were achieved in Written on the Wind . Before Hudson was the big ranch owner , now he 's the son of a hunting companion of Robert Stack 's father who took Hudson under his wing . In other words the James Dean part without the James Dean racism from Giant . Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency that Stack 's Hadley Oil Company uses . Hudson likes her , but she 's dazzled by Stack 's millions and when he woos a girl he 's got the means to really pursue a campaign . She marries Stack . And last but not least in the mix we have Dorothy Malone who 's Stack 's amoral sister who has a yen for Rock , but Rock ain't about to get tangled up with this wild child . Dorothy Malone spent over 10 years in a whole bunch of colorless film heroine roles before landing this gem . She got a Best Supporting Actress Award for her part as Marilee Hadley and it was well deserved . If you like splashy technicolor Fifties soap opera than this is the film for you .  
  Douglas Sirk directs this over-acted drama about the unhappy affluent . Kyle Hadley ( Robert Stack ) and Mitch Wayne ( Rock Hudson ) are boyhood friends with different looks on life . Kyle is the womanizing son of an oil tycoon ; Mitch works for the Hadley Oil Company . Both fall in love with the same woman , Lucy Moore ; but it is Kyle that has the means to wow her off her feet and marry her . Sister Marylee ( Dorothy Malone ) seems to be the town 's nymphomaniac and carrying a torch for Mitch , who always seems to be the one to clean up the Hadley 's messes . Ambitious with pretension ; a little over the top , but the stars make it a movie to see . I was most impressed with Malone . Rounding out the cast : Robert Keith , Edward Platt , John Lurch and Robert J . Wilke .  
  At the Academy Awards ceremony on March 27 , 1957 , Dorothy Malone won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her torrid , over-the-top portrayal of a spoiled heiress of a Texas oil tycoon in WRITTEN ON THE WIND . The 1956 potboiler , adapted from Robert Wilder 's novel , was a veritable three-ring-circus showcasing alcoholism , greed , impotence and nymphomania . Malone 's performance as Marylee Hadley , a lonely rich girl who picks up men to assuage the pain of rejection from a former childhood sweetheart , was representative of the movie as a whole . Mesmerizing to watch even as it resorts to the " lowest common denominator " melodrama , WRITTEN ON THE WIND is ultimately the work of one man , the incredibly gifted director Douglas Sirk , an émigré from pre - World War 2 Weimar Germany who left his European theater heritage behind to pursue a career in Hollywood . An extremely erudite man , Sirk made a name for himself in the 1950 's as Universal Studios ' reliable director of lavish soap operas , most notably with Ross Hunter 's productions of MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION , ALL THAT HEAVEN ALLOWS and IMITATION OF LIFE . Independent producer Albert Zugsmith offered Sirk the opportunity to work outside the limiting constraints of Universal 's demure entertainments and create a more adult , " sensational " product , hence the sultry WIND and its follow-up , 1957 's TARNISHED ANGELS , both released under the Universal International banner . It 's anyone 's guess why Sirk didn't pursue loftier themes , but apparently directing these exaggerated dramas appealed more to his artistic sensibilities . WRITTEN ON THE WIND could be considered Sirk 's epic soap opera ; indeed , it is so rife with human vulnerability and neurosis as depicted among the very rich that it is as compelling to watch as any real life domestic squabble among the rich and famous , perhaps more so . Robert Stack ( not an actor typically known for over - emoting ) nearly matches Malone in intensity with his offering of the weak - willed brother Kyle Hadley , a mere shadow of his patriarchal father . When he finds out that he is unable to impregnate his new bride ( a beautifully leonine Lauren Bacall ) , Hadley goes off the deep end , escalating an already serious drinking problem with a " secret " gun fetish that threatens to make him a human time bomb . Both brother and sister , as venal and unlikeable as they are , are presented as victims of their past , giving them a human quality that makes them seem less monstrous ( and far more interesting than the ' good " side of the family , mainly Bacall and the impossibly handsome Rock Hudson , young Hadley 's old boyhood friend and business associate , a surrogate son to the old man and Malone ' s unattainable object of desire . ) Despite all the domestic co-dependency on display , it 's not so much the story that is memorable here as the way it is filmed . With a real panache for pictorial composition and editing , director Sirk draws his audience into this picture with the most heightened Technicolor cinematography imaginable : every single shot in this film is an eye-filling canvas of saturated colors , from the sight of a tank-like pink Cadillac pulling up to an enormous mansion 's front doors to the garish decor of a luxury Miami hotel , a spectrum of hues almost blinding in their diversity . Action and dramatic scenes feature Sirk 's adept use of tilted camera angles , shadowy lighting and cross-cut editing , shown to greatest effect in the scene where a rebellious , drunken Malone dances uninhibitedly in her upstairs bedroom to the loud blaring of a record player while her stricken father precariously ascends the huge staircase ; the scene is so riveting that you swear you are experiencing a great oedipal drama unfold . What you 're really watching is trash of an enormously entertaining kind , gussied up in lurid Technicolor and polished to perfection by a visual genius .  
  " Ruby in Paradise " is a beautiful , coming-of-age story about a young woman , Ruby Lee Gissing , escaping her stifling roots to become herself . Although the title character is played artfully by the gorgeous Ashley Judd - in likely her first movie role , albeit one to be quite proud of - the emphasis is not upon becoming " somebody , " a la the next Madonna ( whether Jesus ' mother or the lurid , attention-hungry singer ) . It instead emphasizes following ones ' instincts and being somewhat introspective about them , to grow into one 's ideal , adult self . NOTE : This isn't an action movie ! It uses an occasional voice-over narration ( by Ms . Judd ) while writing in her journal - and oh , I see I 've just lost the male half of the readers out there . But be patient with this beautiful movie , where we learn that one 's bliss can be discovered in - oh , I dunno , carrying water and chopping wood . Actor / director / writer Todd Field , who played Nick Nightingale in " Eyes Wide Shut , " co-stars as Ruby Lee 's noble love interest , one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youth . But not even his character is the answer for Ruby Lee : There 's no external hero imposed upon her . The ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves . Writer / director Victor Nunez , who also wrote / directed " Ulee 's Gold , " did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself - confronting age-old challenges of good v . evil along the way . The supporting cast is also stellar , and the music used , particularly the cuts by chanteuse Sam Phillips ( whom I hear is the wife of T . Bone Burnett ) , is right on - most especially " Trying to Hold on to the Earth . " Now , when I hear the first few chords of that song , tears spring to my eyes , Pavlovian and unbidden - not sure if it 's the music , or the indelible connection to the movie 's quiet , charming message of empowerment . This movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find his / her way . For any woman of any age , it is a must see ! The downside : It is NOT on DVD , except in Spanish . ( We learned , however , that it is legal to make one copy of a VHS version , which can be readily found online . My beloved husband found someone with a VHS copy and got a DVD copy made for me . ) Although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up on-air  on an indie channel , usually  you can't count on that when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world . So buy a copy for yourself . This movie should have a major re-release , and it would , if I were Queen of Hollywood . - Figgy Jones  
  I was electrified when I first saw this in 1983 or 1984 . Steven Biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten . I didn't when finally in South Africa in 1993 . It is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty . When I was in South Africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in Natal sing Nkosi Sikelel ' iAfrika , my hair stood on its ends . There is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples .  
  This film moved me beyond comprehension , it is and will remain my favourite film of all time , mainly because it has almost every emotion all rolled into its 157 minutes . What is the hardest part for me to take is that whenever i want to hear the amazing music and songs from the film , I have to put it into my DVD player , so I was wondering if anyone anywhere knows who sings the songs in the film and where they can be found , as I have looked everywhere I can think sporadically over the past 5 years . My favourite quote from the film is when in court the advocate says " But your own words ask for direct confrontation , isn't that a direct call for violence ? " Biko replies " Well you and I are in confrontation now , but I see no violence ! " CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife , Scotland  
  I think the weighted average for this film is too low . I give it a 7 . Very entertaining , although over the top in a few places . My wife says it passes the Danielle Steele test . Superb performances throughout , particularly by Andie MacDowell .  
  Andie MacDowell 's facial expressions are great again in this movie . When you enter 40 and have been single for a while ( or all your life ) you may feel you are wasting away . The movie is a sweet reminder that love can be found just anywhere if your antennae is acutely active . I liked the quick sexual encounter , which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher ( MacDowell ) . Her ex-student is cute enough , still carrying a crush on his teacher for so long . There are some parts that I thought rather unrealistic or unpractical , though . For example , at a scene where the other women 's jealousy override and a scene was set up to make Andie MacDowell dump the young man , would a mature police officer ( the other friend of MacDowell ) allow her friend to do such a sinister act ? Is it so easy for anyone to not stop in front of a car ? Of course accidents happen all the time , but I hoped to see the heroine get happily married with the first man she got involved with ( that was the hardest part to believe ! For such a beautiful woman to stay single for so long ? ) .. Maybe the movie producers are aware of the fact that many romance between an older woman and a younger man do not last for long . Beside they know that a happy ending would not appeal to the public , especially to jealousy women over 40 , who are waiting some miracles to happen . The sad ending with a glimpse of hope for the sad woman who lost her true love is sweet , but if the man continued to live , would that last ? For how long ? Nobody knows . Nonetheless , it 's a movie to make you want to watch it again sometime later .. a year later maybe .  
  Let 's get some things straight first : Zombies don't exist so the filmmaker can have them WALK , RUN , hell even FLY if he wants to . That 's what makes this original Zombie movie so good . Everything they did was so damn original . I hate it when filmmakers do everything like Romero or when fan boys expect everything like Romero . Some idiots think that zombies should only growl like a typical Romero movie , once again zombies don't exist so a filmmaker can make zombies whistle if he wants . The zombies in this movie all look very good but OBVIOUSLY they are not decaying corpses since they JUST freaking died ! They are pretty messed up though and full of chopped faces and blood . One of the coolest scenes was a half eaten cat . It looked so damn real my daughter cried when she saw it . This movie got really good reviews in Fangoria and Rue Morgue so that made me want to go see it . I 'm glad I listened . They are always right when it comes to real horror fan 's tastes . 10 out of 10 ! Go rent it !  
  Revenge is the theme of this Denzel Washington thriller that offers its share of action , mayhem , murder and grisly bloodletting . The essentials are a bodyguard 's search and destroy mission as his charge , young Dakota Fanning , is kidnapped from school , which is exactly what Washington was hired to prevent . The Mexico City locations are as chaotic as the storyline moves towards its predictable , violent conclusion , with plot twists along the way . Washington , a former CIA operative with a drinking problem , gets a good reference from a former fellow agent which sets in motion the plot 's outline . Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry between them and after a troublesome beginning , the bodyguard and his charge become the best of friends . Christopher Walken , Rachel Ticotin , Radha Mitchell , Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke comprise the good cast in support of the two stars .  
  Although I didn't like Stanley & Iris tremendously as a film , I did admire the acting . Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this movie . I haven't always been a fan of Fonda 's work but here she is delicate and strong at the same time . De Niro has the ability to make every role he portrays into acting gold . He gives a great performance in this film and there is a great scene where he has to take his father to a home for elderly people because he can't care for him anymore that will break your heart . I wouldn't really recommend this film as a great cinematic entertainment , but I will say you won't see much bette acting anywhere .  
  Ah , true memories . I lived in Holland at the time and looked eagerly forward to it every Sunday evening and later Tuesdays . I saw it during my 14-16s . Very good for my ( at the time school - ) English , as Dutch TV provides subtitles for other languages , except for kiddies shows nowadays . So you would hear the original voices and language . - The best series were the first three ones and then after the third series , the great character , Nazi Von Gelb , who was such a formidable enemy , disappeared from the series ( I don't think they ever really caught him , he always escaped , leaving room to have him appear again in a next story ) because evidently the series also was distributed to Germany , and a Nazi enemy wouldn't go over very well ! Too bad , because Geoffrey Toone did such a wonderful convincing job of portraying the intelligent Nazi aristocrat , who had this ongoing obsession to take revenge on England . It was a true delight to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series , but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good counterpart and the youngsters were so normal . They were very believable to me at the time and as a kid I could just imagine to be part of these youngsters , who at the time were about four years older than me . It was a very exciting series to me , standing out in my memory of those times as a special show with " the Prisoner " as well . I hope they will publish a good quality DVD of the series , that would be wonderful . Even the bad copies around are still enjoyable to watch . The later series were not as good , watered down and just not as much fun as the first three . Hopefully they also find the other series with Von Gelb to be put on DVD . Greetings from Canada .  
  " One shot , one kill , no exceptions . " A must see if you are into marines or snipers . two big thumbs up ! Great overall storyline , great camera work , good drama , action , details , and more . Pretty close to the real thing . But this isn't a film to breakdown and pick out the editing faults . this is to sit back and have a good 99 mins . The plot has some depth but this movie isn't really about making you think . its about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and action . sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow ups but the first is still the best overall movie . Tom Berenger does a great job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper life . the plain of dealing with all of the death . Must see for sniper fans .  
  This will be somewhat short . First , don't listen to the critics , as it is not as bad as most say it is ! Sniper uses a classic movie formula , which many dismiss immediately as flawing the movie . While sniper does not reflect the 100 % truth about how our country 's Military Snipers work , it does give those who know nothing about the Professional Sniper a glimpse into the world of the Sniper . And yes , the movie has many flaws , but what movie doesn't ? There are many good scenes and good acting by Tom Berenger . I have to say the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with Billy Zane in the Helicopter followed by Zane in the Marine 's bar scene . The best scene in Sniper is with Berenger in the middle of a field with the opposing force sweeping it ! Also there are plenty of good shots of the jungle and some classic shots using the camera as though you are looking through a riflescope . And yes , the Sniper Motto is ` one shot , one kill ' . Judge Sniper for yourself !  
  " Enter the Fat Dragon " is one of the funniest martial art movies I had the opportunity to see . Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend . Just like Tang Lung of " Way of the Dragon . " Wherever Sammo goes , trouble starts , therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences . Luckily , Sammo 's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol , Bruce Lee . He even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way Bruce Lee does and also releases his screeching yell . He also uses nunchucks in a scene . It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee . There 's a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters . Sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one . Sort of like " The Game of Death " , where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another . This is one of the films I really enjoyed watching and also the very first Sammo Hung movies I 've seen . Excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughs . A rare classic Sammo Hung film I highly recommend for all you martial art fans out there . 8.5/10 !  
  " Return of the Jedi " is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right , and that is a shame , because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling . It manages to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale , and does so very convincingly . Yes , there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit . But the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga , where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader , the most recognizable villain in movie history . Return of the Jedi did so many things right that people tend to overlook : it presented an incredible conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline ( which went from slightly implausible in the " Empire Strikes Back " to very convincing here ) , an exciting opening at Jabba 's Palace , a masterful performance of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor , Luke finally coming into his own , the resolution of Solo and Leia 's romance , and the extremely powerful final moments on the Endor moon . Yes , there are slight annoyances . But they are the annoyances of a generation of moviegoers who 've had time to nitpick every single scene . It 's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter . It 's not a ' good ' movie - it 's fantastic !  
  John Ford is one of the most influential and best remembered American filmmakers in the history of film , his name usually associated with the western film genre . However , John Ford 's arguably best film is not a western at all but a seedy drama set in the Irish fight for independence in the early 1920s : 1935 's The Informer . Times are tough on many in Ireland and the burnt out Gypo Nolan is caught in a web of poverty and desperation - and the walls are closing in . Gypo is big but he is not the brightest bulb on the tree , has a warm heart but a short fuse , and never seems to really think things all the way through but he is not a criminal or a self-centered pig . Walking the streets starving with no where to live , the hulking Gypo Nolan finds the prime lady in his life , Katie Madden , on the streets soliciting herself because of her own desperate situation and starts to dream about taking her to the United States if he only had the 20 Pounds to pay for it . As luck would have it , his friend Frankie is back in town with a 20 Pound price over his head and Gypo is desperate enough to inform the police of Frankie 's whereabouts . Gypo , with the new 20 Pounds of blood money earned , finds this foggy night particularly foggier as guilt swells all over him and the IRA invests all their resources to find Frankie 's informer . Victor McLaglen portrays the fallen Gypo Nolan and definitely deserved the Best Actor Oscar he was awarded for this film . His brutish , stupid , and tender turns give the character dimension and McLaglen is only second to Dudley Moore 's character Arthur Bach from the 1981 film Arthur as the most entertaining cinematic drunk . Margot Grahame 's performance as Katie Madden is also excellent but she and McLaglen are the only members of the cast who truly impress . Preston Foster is especially miscast as an IRA head , mainly because he is most obviously not Irish , and J . M . Kerrigan borders on irritating throughout his role in the film but this disappointing supporting cast is the film 's only poor point . Often overshadowed by some of Ford 's better known westerns like The Searchers or The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance , The Informer is easily one of John Ford 's best films - if not his very best . Beginning what would be a long career of Oscar nominations and wins for John Ford , The Informer won four Oscars including one for him for best director in 1936 . Ford and company 's use of shadows and light in the film is particularly engaging and vital to telling the story . Gypo 's walk through the streets is narrated by the gloomy state of the town and the glaring accusations of the street lamps , each shadow constantly reminding him of his dark deed . Ford 's command of this technique was amazing to watch ; if The Informer was made 10 years later ( thus making the genre requirements ) it would probably be considered one of the best films noir of all time but that does not hinder it from being remembered as an excellent classic film .  
  This is probably the best of all of the Star Wars movies . The starting point of the movie was almost like Episode IV-spacey cabaret music and thoughts of a cabaret place , where the seriousness of mobster Jabba the Hutt was getting even more serious . He ordered Luke to die in a basement pit by the bone-crushing teeth of Bantha , who looked almost like a cross between a bear and a shark . Luke 's Jedi powers eventually finish the monster off . Adding to the sneaky rescue of Han Solo , who was frozen alive at the end of Episode V , Jabba was very angry about this that Luke was sentenced to die at the Sarlacc pit outside . But all of the Star Wars " good guys " , especially R2-D2 , had other ideas .. and those other ideas fended off Luke 's execution ; in the end , most of Jabba 's soldiers died and Princess Leia was able to use the force to fatally choke Jabba to death . Like in Episode IV , the Death Star in Episode VI makes its appearance . As I analyzed the rebel fleet attacking the Imperial fighters around the Death Star , the Star Destroyer personnel , I guessed , sped up the arming of the main laser , using the Imperial fighters as a diversion . The 20-25 Star Destroyers that lined up were ready to attack but was called off and instead the laser weapon on the Death Star was fired in surprise . Once it fired , the rebel fleet 's only hope was that the Death Star 's deflector shield was going to be knocked out , and this affected Lando so much because he wanted to destroy the Death Star but he couldn't until the shield was taken out . And it was taken out with Lando 's increasing impatience . Like in Episode V , the Imperial Walkers make their menacing appearance with their twin cannons , killing at least one of the Ewoks .. but the Ewoks found ancient yet unusual way to deal with them . For instance , Chewbacca , as well as another Ewok , was able to commandeer one of the walkers ( and actually used that to destroy from behind one of the walkers ) , and the other Ewoks used logs to knock out two other walkers . It is amazing what Luke could do with his Jedi powers on his Light Sabre , like , for instance , the scene on Endor where Luke deflects incoming laser shots from a Storm Trooper speeder bike , and using the Sabre to knock out part of the bike . Or , in a climax , using the Sabre to break off his own father 's arm during the final Sabre fight with Sith Vader . You probably know the Ewoks celebration after the Death Star was blown , complete with a short display of fireworks , drumming on the spoils of victory ( e . g . , Storm Trooper Masks ) , and Luke finally meeting up with Leia after Luke 's own nemesis-Darth Vader , now dead , is burned on a pyre . The celebration include Ewoks singing but I think Lucas did not buy that-even with the strong respect of film composer John Williams . On the home movie version , I think Lucas himself wanted a different ending . In addition to the celebration on Endor , he wanted shots of celebratory scenes on the several surviving rebel planets , including a celebratory laser shot that destroys the statue of the Sith . The Ewoks song was replaced by an alternative instrumental piece . He probably wanted the extra stuff to prove that with the Death Star 's destruction , balance had been restored to the rebel galaxies .  
  I don't remember when I first heard about this movie , but I rented it about six years ago , and it still remains one of my favorite comedies . I will admit , you probably will despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music . But if you are a rap fan , even a casual one , you will love the inside jokes and references . One of the best lines in the movie is about the difference between a b * and a h * ; I still use this line today and get lots of laughs with it . One of the best performances comes from Larry Scott , who played nerd Lamar in ` Revenge of the Nerds ' . It is unfortunate that this movie will likely never get a DVD release .  
  CB4 was awful , but it may have given Cundieff the idea to it better . More like Spinal Tap than anything else , the film is clever from the start . Surprising anyone who saw it back in the mid nineties . The performances are played for laughs but not so much so that they are cartoon characters , more like Marx brothers . These guys are real and slightly diverse . They react to situations like any of us might . Well , we may not throw a tantrum when our performance hats are late to the gig , or pull guns and beat down a record company exec , but you get the picture . N ( n * as ) W ( with ) H ( hats ) takes itself seriously enough to reel you in , then you 're hooked . rent or get this at all costs , even if you 're not really into rap music , this will still leave you gassing out loud . Comparing this to CB4 is like comparing George Lucas ' Star Wars to Gil Gerards'Buck Rogers ' I think you see my point  
  Okay , my title is kinda lame , and almost sells this flick short . I remember watching Siskel & Ebert in ' 94 talking about this movie , and then playing a clip or two . Not being a rap-conscious guy ( although I could identify Snoop Dogg , Vanilla Ice , and MC Hammer music ) , I wasn't much interested when they started talking about the film . But then , S & E showed the scene where the band explains how they picked their name ( using some " shady " logic and a bunch of " made up " facts ) , and then another scene where the band , and their rival band , both visit a school to promote getting involved ( and , of course , NWH comes up with some " info " about how the rival band leader is a loser because he got good grades in school and was on the yearbook committee ) . So I filed it away that I should see this movie . A couple of years later , this thing shows up on HBO and I recorded it , only to laugh my butt off for hours . Yes , it has a " Spinal Tap " kind of rhythm to it .. even the documentarist takes essentially the same " tone " in setting up the clips , and the band follows a similar path ( what I now call the " Behind the Music " phenomenon - smalltime band has good chemistry , gets famous , too much money too fast , squabbling , drugs , some type of death , band breaks up , then reconciles , finishing with a hope for more albums in the future , and fade to black ) . The one thing that is true is that in Spinal Tap , you catch the band perhaps with a little more success in their past . But Tap drags at some points , and in my mind is reduced to laughs that are set up by specific scenes . Oh , this is his rant about the backstage food , this is spot where he wants the amp to go to " ELEVEN " , this is the spot where the guy makes the pint-sized stonehenge , etc .. Contrasting to FoaBH , which seems to have more " unexpected " humor . You can see some of it coming , but there isn't a big setup for every joke . Sometimes , the jokes just kinda flow . Cundieff and the other actors in the band had a real chemistry that worked . Also , the direct references to Vanilla Ice , Hammer , and a bunch of other caricature-type rappers really worked well . This strikes me as a film you watch once to get the main story and laughs , and then go back and watch to catch the subtle jokes . And the songs . Is " My Peanuts " better than " Big Bottom " ( from Spinal Tap ) ? I don't know - but they 're both damn funny . Tone Def 's awful video during his " awakening " phase is so bizarre , yet so funny . I could go on awhile , but save your time and don't waste it on CB4 . I watched the first half hour , and got bored . You don't get bored on FoaBH . There are slightly less funny moments , but you can never tell when something good is about to happen . Perhaps my favorite scene is when Ice Cold and Tastey Taste ( name ripoffs if I 've ever heard any ) discover they 've been sharing the same girl .. at one point , you 've got those two pointing guns at each other , and the next thing you know , the manager , the photographer , the girl , and I think even Tone Def are in the room pointing guns at each other , switching targets back and forth . And , of course , someone does get shot . I did find it odd that NWH 's managers suffered similar fates to Spinal Tap 's drummers ( although none spontaneously combusted , I don't think ) . There were enough similarities that I cannot ignore the likelihood that Cundieff saw " Spinal Tap " prior to writing this film , although this is clearly much more the Spinal Tap of hip-hop . While some similarities exist , the humor is different , and the movie seems more like a real documentary ( maybe because we don't recognize a single actor in this thing , even the guy who played " Lamar " from " Revenge of the Nerds " ) . All in all , this movie has , in my opinion , " street cred " . Kinda like NWH .  
  First it was Jack The Ripper , now it is Alan Feinstone . The crazy dentist tortures people in horrific ways . Quite realistic at times but some of the acting is abysmal and comical . Especially from Corbin Bernson . In some scenes there is dental torture that will really make you cringe .  
  This gem for gore lovers is extremely underrated . It 's pure delight and fun ! Gratuitous servings of blood , insanity and black humor , which can please even the most demanding lover of the genre . A full exploitation of the almost universal fear of dentists and flawlessly shot . Only for the connoisseurs .  
  This is , without a shadow of a doubt , one of the scariest and most intriguing episodes of Doctor Who . This is a thrilling psychological ride and you will probably find your own beliefs being thrown into question . Riddled with spine-chilling moments , this is an episode no " Who " fan can afford to miss . Starting from when the pit was opened after the events in " The Impossible Planet " , the Doctor and Ida are trapped and are running out of air . With no other alternatives , they decide to find what lies at the bottom of the pit , an event which surpasses even The Doctor 's expectations . Whilst there , the Doctor is forced to make what he considers to be the ultimate sacrifice .. Meanwhile , Rose and the other members of the Planet try to find a way to fend off the Ood , whose minds have been poisoned by the Beast . Also , is Toby Zed truly cured of his possession by the Beast ?  
  Sudden Impact is the best of the five Dirty Harry movies . They don't come any leaner and meaner than this as Harry romps through a series of violent clashes , with the bad guys getting their just desserts . Which is just the way I like it . Great story too and ably directed by Clint himself . Excellent entertainment .  
  Director / star Clint Eastwood 's " Sudden Impact " is an intriguing addition to the " Dirty Harry " series - a combination of crude film-making and genius . It 's mediocre and silly in parts , brilliant and classic in others , with compelling , gripping pacing . There are numerous echoes of the first film here - the shoot ' em up " Make my day " scene recalls the " Do you feel lucky " one , one of the villains is as viscerally repugnant as the first film 's Scorpio , an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as Harry 's partner - just to name a few . Harry Callahan is still at odds with the higher-ups in the department , still mean , still tough , but now he 's older and wearier . His constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict - a respect and reverence for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice , the two things not always being compatible . This " incompatibility " is the underlying theme of the series . The first film posed a simple question , " What about the victim 's rights ? " - ( do they outweigh those of the criminal ? Vice versa ? Depends ? ) . That film 's answer was controversial , prompting a sequel ( the highly enjoyable " Magnum Force " ) which set out to draw the line between Harry 's brand of justice and pure , heartless vigilantism . Dirty Harry , like many of Clint 's other roles , is the personification of vengeance , the protector of the the defenseless . This movie however brings it back to the victim , in this case Jennifer ( portrayed by Sondra Locke ) , who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her now-incapacitated sister by ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men ( and one woman ) who committed the crime . Without going into a play-by-play of the whole movie , I will say this - I mentioned earlier that " Sudden Impact " echoes the first film - it actually also sprinkles in little references and in-jokes from the whole series ( the confusion concerning the captain 's last name is an example - an intentional prank , I believe ) . The relationship between Callahan and Jennifer is neat - has our rogue cop hero found a soul-mate in this lady vigilante ? And is she a vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sister 's tarnished rights ? The exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series , one which I personally ( as a fan ) found quite moving . That last scene alone makes Sudden Impact the legitimate climax to the " Dirty Harry " collection , the perfect answer to the conflict posed in the first film . ( Not to knock " The Dead Pool " - that excellent movie was a relatively light-hearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring Harry Callahan , rather than a character-defining film like this one ) . This movie did well in the theaters - audiences in the Reagan Era found Harry and his ilk quite appealing , and the President himself frequently quoted " Go ahead , make my day . "  
  When you see the cover of the DVD you 're convinced this is some Class B cheesy cheapie , a film made for $ 1,000 in somebody 's backyard . Wrong ! This is quality material and really good . It 's a comedy and a clever one at that . It also is very touching in spots , with a nice spot of kindness . The production values are very good ( this looks excellent ) , the actors are known , the film 's direction and sets are great . It 's amazing . Who would have thought ? Carrie-Ann Moss , playing against-type , is terrific , as " Helen Robinson , " the June Cleaver-like wife ; Billy Connolly is great as the grunting good-hearted zombie " Fido ; " Tim Blake Nelson ( " Mr . Theopolis " ) is a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend " Tammy , " and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads ( check ) are excellent , too K'Sun Ray as young " Timmy Robinson , " shouldn't be overlooked , either . In fact , he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone . If I explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it . You 'll just have to take the word of the people here who liked it and found it to be a very , very pleasant surprise . You need a dark sense of humor , though ; an appreciation of the absurd .  
  When it comes to creating a universe George Lucas is the undisputed master and his final Star Wars film is very , very good ( and more appropriately rated in comparison to the two previous films in the original saga ) . Having recently seen Revenge of the Sith really puts this movie in perspective . The final battle seems even more climactic knowing what Anakin Skywalker went through at the manipulative hands of the Emperor . It also makes the final battle between Luke and Vader more bitter considering the love he felt for Padmé and the love she felt for her children . Actually while the new films ( especially Episode II ) are inferior to the original films they are good for one reason only . They make the old films seem even better . Mark Hamill does an exceptional job in this movie . He really brings the changes Luke has gone through seem real . In all fairness I believe that he should have become a big actor based on these films because he really does a great job . Harrison Ford is still good . However , you can feel that he has done Raiders and Blade Runner in between the two final chapters of Star Wars because he seems to have grown quite a bit . He adds more comedy ( obviously inspired from Raiders ) to the character which works brilliantly . In short Han Solo is better than ever . Carrie Fisher was never really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable . Ian McDiarmid appears in this film and having seen Episode II I can safely say that he is one of the most accomplished villains ever . James Earl Jones still provides the voice for Vader and he is still very , very good . In terms of how the movie looks its pretty safe to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than in either of the previous ( two ) movies but this was always Lucas ' forté so that is really to be expected . The final battle over Endor is very well made both in terms of the general effects and tension wise . It was also a nice touch that Lucas decided to have three battles take place at the same time as it added to the overall tension of the climax . The only thing I feel is dragging the movie down from an otherwise deserved 9 are the Ewoks . These little creatures are so annoying they almost ruin every scene they are in . Besides I find it to be a little to kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of Storm Troopers with laser guns and mighty machinery . All in all Return of the Jedi is a very good movie but the fact that Richard Marquand is a less accomplished director than Irvin Kershner does that the overall feel of the movie is less than brilliant . Also George Lucas ' stupid decision to add the Ewoks to the universe does that the film falls short of brilliance . 8/10  
  Valliant effort to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle to pronounce this director 's distaste for war . The audience not only learns a great deal about early mining rescue procedures but , we learn that Europeans at the interval between WWI and WWII , had concerning pacifists ( for lack of a better term ) . The speeches given by both representatives of each country at the end of the film , are inspiring given the time . Although the revised edition , through the transfer technology of early foreign films , " cuts-off characters heads " at times , this film holds it 's own in many different aspects . Character analysis , lighting techniques , historical content and a scenario that has tested and inspired many a writer and filmmaker . Pabst went on to Direct and put to screen Weil & Brecht 's " Three Penny Opera " , starring the original star , Lotte Lenya .  
  The name of this film alone made me want to see just what it was all about , so I taped this film during the early hours of the AM . If you ever wanted to see what miners had to go through during the early days and actually see a dramatic scene when the mine crumbles in on the men . This film clearly wants to show that Germany and France can work together and be friends after WW I and how the Germans came to the aid of the French miners much to the unbelief of the French townsfolk . The actors were all outstanding , with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small young boy who worked in the mine . There is an old old retired miner who manges to go down the mine by ladder when the elevator breaks down . If you are a real film buff , this is a film you will not want to miss .  
  This is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein , played wonderfully by Walter Matthau , and his cronies play match maker to his niece ( Meg Ryan ) and a talented auto mechanic ( Tim Robbins ) . The interplay among these major roles is augmented by a terrific supporting cast of well recognized character actors . This movie is cute and fun .. a " feel-gooder " ! Hearty recommendations .  
  I originally saw this film years ago during Cinemax Friday after dark series ( back when the cable box was built like a keyboard ) , and it intrigued me . Even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well acted . The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very enjoyable . They have a good chemistry together & Miou-Miou makes a pink fur look breathtaking . A movie like this probably wouldn't be made in these politically correct times ( at least not in the US ) , since it seems to sensationalize things like violence , robbery , & casual sex . This movie proves that with a talented cast & also talented directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject . It saddened me to find out Patrick Dewaere committed suicide & in the near future I , ll will check him out with Depardieu & Miou-Miou in Get Out Your Hankerchief .  
  " The Matador " is a dark comedy starring Pierce Brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straight-arrow , happily-married American businessman ( Greg Kinnear ) in Mexico . Although the sardonic Julian ( ironically surnamed " Noble " ) appears to be a " tough guy " on the surface , underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities , a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless . Thus on his birthday , he reaches out to Danny , a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by Julian 's " unconventional " lifestyle . In fact , both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter , franker moments of self-evaluation . Although the film is a bit too reminiscent of " Analyze This " and " Midnight Run " to feel entirely fresh and original , " The Matador , " nevertheless , earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting . Brosnan , looking aged and almost used up , sinks his teeth into the role of Julian in a way he never has before . Playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being , Brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment , then genuine and sympathetic the next . He always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale . Kinnear is also excellent as the Regular Joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the Dark Side as his relationship with Julian deepens . Hope Davis does a fine job as " Bean , " Danny 's loyal and loving wife who , like her husband , finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and " dangerous " figure from a world far different from the one she knows . At times , we find ourselves feeling that " The Matador " is holding something back from us , not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise . At the end it feels a little too light , a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should . This could be because this is the feature film debut for writer / director Richard Shephard , and he hasn't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet . Still , one appreciates the fact that he doesn't always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece , rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laugh . ' The Matador " is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will , hopefully , signal a new phase in Brosnan 's acting career .  
  I have always been a fan of the show so I 'll admit that I am biased . When the show 's run ended , I felt like too many questions remained unanswered . This movie to me felt like closure . To see all the people I 'd followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding . I have heard that this is probably the only Homicide movie that we can expect . If that is so , this is the appropriate way to go out . This movie is sometimes poignant , sometimes upsetting , but always satisfying . If you are or ever have been a fan of the show , watch this movie .  
  Although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that weren't exactly true to character , this was Classic H : LOTS . The characters , outside of Mike Giardello ( Giancarlo Esposito ) , were true to form , and the reunion scenes of Pembleton ( Andre Braugher ) and Bayliss ( Kyle Secor ) were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screen . " Homicide : The Movie " aka " Life Everlasting " is a fan flick , but stands on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series . Fontana , Overmeyer and Yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from 7 seasons and every major cast member of " the best damn show on television " together for the series finale that NBC never bothered to give it . True to " Homicide " form , there were no happy endings , such is life . That 's what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie-cutter cop shows left on television . Kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike . * I call myself a " Homicidal Maniac " if for no other reason than to keep my co-workers in a cooperative mood . *  
  This is the final episode we deserved . At the end of the last season , things were left in a ' life goes on ' mood , which was hardly the wrap-up that this realistic series deserved . While not a happy show , this series was always one that made you think ( a rare thing on television ) , and this is no exception . ' Is death justified by reasoning ? ' ' Are morals reflective of society , or is society shaped by the morals that are selected by the few in power ? ' ' What is a just death , and can it exist ? ' All of these questions , and more , are posed by the writers of this show every week , and this is their final thesis . Fine acting , great writing , wonderful camera-work , brilliant editing , clean direction . If you have seen the series and you missed this when it first ran , then get a hold on a copy somehow . If you never watched the series when it ran , then this will stand up on its own , but it may be heavy going trying to keep up with who all the characters are and what they are alluding to in their varied pasts . For those of us who were avid viewers of the series in the last two seasons , this is very satisfying viewing .  
  My favourite police series of all time turns to a TV-film . Does it work ? Yes . Gee runs for mayor and gets shot . The Homicide " hall of fame " turns up . Pembleton and nearly all of the cops who ever played in this series . A lot of flashbacks helps you who hasn´t seen the TV-series but it amuses the fans too . The last five minutes solves another murder and at the very end even two of the dead cops turn up . And a short appearance from my favourite coroner Juliana Cox . This is a good film .  
  Was'nt really bad for Raw 's first PPV of 006 . But the ending was really really shocking to everyone in attendance & the ones who were watching at home . FIRST MATCH - RIC FLAIR VS . EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad opener , these two can seriously put on a great match if they had more time to put on a wrestling match . Flair wins by DQ after Edge slams him with his MITB briefcase . 3/10 SECOND MATCH - TRISH STRATUS VS . MICKIE JAMES FOR THE WWE WOMEN 'S CHAMPIONSHIP Not bad noticing the fact that this is the first time these Divas faced off in the ring together . Mickie goes for a modified Chick Kick , but Trish ducks & nails her own Chick Kick for the win to retain her title . 3/10 THIRD MATCH - TRIPLE H VS . BIG SHOW Seriously good this match was , really . The whole match HH focuses on Big Show 's injured arm but Big Show still fights back . Later HH is able to topple down Big Show & nails a Pedigree for the win . 5/10 FOURTH MATCH - SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS . VISCERA { This was a bonus match } Not that bad , it was alright . After Viscera was down , behind the referee , Benjamin 's mama got a purse { Which had bricks in it } & slammed Viscera on the head with it three times . Viscera got up only to get caught with a spinning heel kick by Benjamin for the win against the big man . 4/10 FIFTH MATCH - JERRY ' THE KING ' LAWLER VS . GREGORY HELMS Boring , slow & sloppy . Both men didn't really put a very good effort . Jerry Lawler wins after a Fist Drop for the win . 2/10 SIXTH MATCH - TORRIE Wilson VS . VICTORIA VS . ASHLEY VS . MARIA VS . CANDICE MICHELLE IN A FIRST EVER WOMEN 'S GAUNTLET MATCH It was pretty entertaining to me . Ashley { I think } eliminates Candice last to win the first ever Women 's Gauntlet match . 5/10 SEVENTH MATCH - JOHN CENA VS . CHRIS MASTERS VS . CARLITO VS . SHAWN MICHAELS VS . KANE VS . KURT ANGLE W / DAIVARI IN AN ELIMINATION CHAMBER MATCH FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP It was a cool Elimination chamber match . But nothing will top last year 's Elimination Chamber which was the best . The last three are Masters , Cena & Carlito . Carlito turns his back on Masters & gets a roll-up on him to eliminate him . Seconds later Cena gets a roll-up on Carlito for the three count to win the Elimination Chamber & retain his WWE Title . But his night was not over yet . 7/10 After the match , Vince McMahon comes out & congratulates Cena for his victory . Vince McMahon states that his night is not over yet , & says that Edge cashes in his Money In The Bank opportunity to challenge Cena for the title . Edge comes out with Lita , gives the briefcase to Vince & heads off in the ring as Cena has one more match to go here tonight . EIGHT MATCH - JOHN CENA VS . EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP { Cena who is busted open during the Chamber match } gets pounded straight away by Edge , Edge then nails a Spear on Cena , goes for the cover & to his shock Cena breaks out . Edge nails another Spear & covers for the shocking three count as he has beat Cena & has won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career . 1/10 So last year 's New Years Revolution was better than this year 's , but it was still alright . The EC match was also good & the shocking of Edge cashing in his MITB opportunity is definitely the most shockingest on the PPV show . Overall : I 'll give it 7/10 & a C  
  While being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the Gundam Wing series , upon re-watching the series , I have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated , but the plot , the gundam design , character design , and character depth are masterfully executed . While at first appearing like a boy band of sorts , the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art , with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters . Consequently , it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character . Personally , I liked Heero because of his stoic personality . While I may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood , I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general ( how can we obtain peace ? ) while providing action packed battles in large robot suits , which , to say the least , is excellent .  
  I remember watching " Gung Ho " as a child with my mother , and wondered why she would always cry in the last few minutes . I , of course , found the entire movie hilarious , particularly the mannerisms of the characters . It wasn't until I was much older and watched it again that I realized how much deeper this show actually is . Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe shine in their roles as the reluctant mediators . Keaton ceases to amaze me with his real-life style of line delivery , and Watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix . I also thought that Patti Yasutake ( Umeki ) was simply fabulous in her role as the comic relief . I think this movie is one of the most underrated films of the 80s . We can all learn a lesson from the merging of the American and Japanese workers in this film .. sometimes you really * can * have " the best of both worlds . " And now I understand why my mother felt the way she did in those closing moments . I 'd rather have one of those cars , too .  
  When two writers make a screenplay of a horror version of Breakfast At Tiffany 's , you know something is going to go right . Drew Barrymore , Patrick Highsmith , Leslie Hope , and Sally Kellerman are excellent actors . The FBI agent was a terrible actor . The scenes where Patrick looked Holly up and down like some sort of objectifier , those was just weird . Drew Barrymore is very hot . Intimate Strangers , where Sally Kellerman worked , was a great part . The weird gummy worm was just weird . Nathan was a very handsome cat . But what was that scene where Patrick followed Holly into a cesspool and Mr . Gooding attacked him ? And the scene with Dr . Wallace ? What was he doing fumbling around in there ? And not every male has a female , as Sally Kellerman stated . And when Patrick and Elizabeth saw Drew outside of Victor 's , that was weird .  
  I think Hollow Point is a funny film with some good moments I have never seen before in action movies . Well , both Tia Carrere and Thomas Ian Griffith aren't so good in acting , but Tia Carrere is nice and good looking girl , isn't it ? But Donald Sutherland is superb in his role so-so mad gangster .  
  It 's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used " Wall Street " to let us know that greed is good . Now , Michael Douglas takes the GG persona and morphs it into a Secret Service agent , Pete Garrison . Guess what ? It works ! This is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing . The detail work in showing the security precautions taken by the SS on behalf of the President and First Lady was likewise intriguing . All the leads were pretty good but , try as I might , I could not accept Eva Longoria as a Secret Service agent . Whereas Jodie Foster just made you suspend belief and really think she was FBI agent Starling in " Silence of the Lambs " , you do not get the same feeling with Longoria . Nevertheless , this is a fun film , escapist entertainment with the Beltway as the backdrop .  
  I would firstly say that somehow I remember seeing this movie in my early childhood , I couldn't read the subtitles and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery . But I did really like the concept . If you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie . That said , having just watched the restored 137 minute version on DVD I have to say I enjoyed it , though not as much as when I was seven ( I remembered the ending ) . There are aspects of the movie that are worthy of criticism , the first 15 minutes and final 15 minutes both have some really comic moments , my favourite being the contrast between scenes acted out in the final 10 minutes and the curious choice of backing music ( listen to the lyrics ) . For an action film there is a great deal of focus on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the strain of their time travel takes its toll . By the ending of the movie I had decided that this was a good thing , when seven I though the ' relationship ' guff was a bad thing . For an action film there is also plenty of gratifying gory action , especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of Shogun era warriors . The makers of the movie have ensured that as many deaths as possible are bloody and , lets face it , humorous . I thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when I was a kid , and I am not ashamed to say that I still do . I also like the fact that the modern day soldiers in general don't spend the movie walking on egg shells trying to avoid altering the space time continuum , they 've got heavy calibre machine guns , mortars , rocket launchers , a tank and a helicopter and they 're hell bent on making feudal Japan theirs . Which is what I 'd like to think any vigorous IMDb user would do in their boots . In short the movies worth watching , it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise , and at the same time offers some hefty hints as to why a movie like G.I. Samurai is so unique .  
  " Kalifornia " is a great film that makes us look at ourselves . The film has a great cast , Brad Pitt ( Johnny Suede , A River Runs Through It , and The Legends Of The Fall ) as Early Grayce , David Duchovny ( The X Files ) as Brian Kessler , Michelle Forbes ( Star Trek : The Next Generation , Homicide : Life On The Street , and Escape From L.A. ) as Carrie Loughlin , Brian 's girlfriend , and Juliette Lewis ( Natural Born Killers , Cape Fear , and What 's Eating Gilbert Grape ) as Adele Corners , Early 's girlfriend . Brian Kessler is a writer who is a Liberal , is getting ready to write a book about serial killers . Brian and his girlfriend , Carrie decide they want to move to California , so Brian places an ad at the college for some who wants to go to California , to share expenses on the trip . Early Grayce is an ex con and sociopath on parole , who recently lost his job at the mirror factory in town , is in debt , owes his landlord money . Early 's parole officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job . Early goes to the college and sees the ad , he later tells Adele , his girlfriend about leaving to go to California . Early and Adele meet Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and leave town . Brian and Carrie do not know that he is a killer who just killed his landlord . For a little while Brian and Carrie thought of Early and Adele different but got to know them and become sort of friends , Carrie and Adele become real good friends . Their journey is a very learning one . Though Brain and Carrie not knowing early is a killer till later on in the movie . The question Brian asks in this film about the difference between killers and us is a very good question . Early Grayce is a sociopath who doesn't see the error of his ways , goes down hill later on and pays the price . This film is a great movie , I give it 10/10 stars and 2 thumbs up . I love the songs in the movie , especially at the end of the film , the song " Look Up To The Sky " by The Indians .  
  Kalifornia is the story of a writer and his girlfriend photographer who are looking for someone to help pay gas money and take turns at the wheel for a cross country road trip to famous murder sights . Ironically a serial killer and his girlfriend answer the post . Kalifornia is a diamond in the rough and a very intriguing journey with a serial killer . Great performances all around by the leads with Pitt in particular being exceptional . Check it out !  
  This is a racist movie , but worthy of study and enjoyment . First time through it the natural inclination is to focus on Erbe & Dad . They have a relaxed , peaceful thing going , what with her still at home about to graduate from high school , and him retired and kicking back waiting for inspiration to do something . Second time through you realize how horribly the sister 's husband is dissed by her friends in the backwoods blues bar . He takes it , it 's the thing to do these days , and the critical moment passes as if they were chatting about the weather . In that same scene the sister 's blues song is a real tear-jerker if you 're the least bit sensitive and like that kind of music . Her performance feels like the climax of the story ; a blues story with the good guys being " people of color " in their element in backwoods , SC . Meanwhile , all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies . That 's cool , long as you recognize it as fiction .  
  WWE has produced some of the worst pay-per-views in its history over the past few months . Cyber Sunday , Survivor Series and December to Dismember were appalling to say the least and so it was relying on its B brand show , Smackdown ! to attempt to end the year on a high note . Armageddon had two major gimmick matches in the Last Ride and Inferno matches , three Championships were on the line and an interesting main event in the shape of a tag team war featuring Batista and John Cena against King Booker and Finlay . However , it was an amendment to one of those Championship matches that brought us not only the match of the night but also now a match of the year candidate when Teddy Long gave us fans an early Christmas present . T-Lo changed the WWE Tag Team Championship match from Champions , London and Kendrick against to Regal and Taylor to a four team Ladder match including MNM and The Hardy Boyz . I am not going to dwell on this match too much as nothing I can say would be able to do it justice . This has to be seen to be believed . There were many high spots and many more brutal bumps and awkward landings . The one move I have to talk about however was the one that took Joey Mercury straight to the emergency room midway through the contest . Jeff Hardy jumped onto a ladder that was set up in the see saw position with Matt Hardy holding both members of MNM over the opposite end of it to take the full force . Unfortunately for Mercury he didn't get his hands up to protect his face and took the ladder full force in the nose and left eye . This was vicious . His face was instantly a mess for all to see and not surprisingly this ended Mercury 's night early . We found out later he suffered a broken nose and cuts under his left eye . Be warned . This is not for the faint of heart . The ending to this roller-coaster of a match came after Paul London managed to grab both Championship belts for the victory . I have been watching wrestling for almost 15 years and it doesn't get any better than this match . Unbelievable . The night opened with only the 4th ever Inferno match . Kane took on MVP in a good match but it was all about the visual and not really about the action . There were a few close calls with the flames for both competitors but in the end it was Kane who forced MVP onto the flames after they both ended up outside the ring . MVP ran around the ring whilst his butt was on fire and there was a sick part of me that laughed watching this . May I suggest to Michael Hayes that MVP comes out next week on Smackdown ! to Johnny Cash 's Ring of Fire . The other gimmick match of the night , and the second match of a triple main event was an all out war Last Ride match between Mr Kennedy and The Undertaker . This was a stiff match from start to finish and was the best of the series Undertaker and Kennedy have had yet . The used poles , chairs and one scene had The Undertaker thrown 15 feet from the Armageddon set onto what was suppose to be the concrete floor . Unfortunately it was plain to see that this was nothing but a crash mat and crowd didn't pop for this . The ending came after a chokeslam by The Dead Man to Kennedy on top of the hearse followed quickly by a match-winning tombstone . In other notable happening from the card . Chris Benoit defeated Chavo Guerrero by submission in another stiff match . This was a very good bout with Benoit hitting 8 German suplexes on Chavo at one time . Benoit was also considering whether to put Vikki Guerrero in the sharpshooter or not . Luckily he came to his senses and let her go . This led to Chavo attempting the roll up only for it to be countered into the sharpshooter for the submission . Another cracking match on the card was the Cruiserweight Championship contest between the longest reigning Champion in WWE , Gregory Helms and Jimmy Wang Yang . Featuring a lot of high flying and dangerous spots , some of which took place outside the ring , this was a match much more deserving of the crowd response than what it got . JBL put it best when he berated the fans in Richmond , Virginia for sitting on their hands during this one and at one point even started a boring chant . Helms picked up the duke after a jawbreaker type manoeuvre with his knees to Smackdowns ! resident redneck . The Boogeyman pinned The Miz in a worthless match . I hate The Boogeyman with a passion . Only worth listening too for JBL 's ranting about Miz . JBL is comedy gold . The last match of the night was main event number 3 . World Heavyweight Champion , Batista and WWE Champion , John Cena teamed up to take on Finlay and the Champion of Champions , King Booker . There was no way the match could top the Tag Team Championship match from earlier on but it entertained none the less . The match would have been more memorable had it been given an extra five to ten minutes but how many times have I said that about WWE matches this year already . It was King Booker who was pinned at the end of the match after a big Batistabomb . So 2006 is over for the WWE in regards to it 's pay-per-view schedule . It started the year on a terrible note with New Year 's Revolution but ended on a high one with Armageddon . This Ladder match will long be remembered as one of the greatest ladder matches of all time . My hat is off to all eight competitors who but their bodies on the line to give the fans one hell of a match .  
  What happens when the average joe finds out he has supernatural powers ? The premise may sound familiar . The Watchmen ? Unbreakable ? However , the Russian sci-fi action flick , The Sword Bearer , is far from the standard stock . The story revolves around a man named Sasha who as a boy was shunned from society , his peers and family due to a supernatural power that he possess . When he wishes or his anger allows , a sword extends from his arm piercing his own skin . Very wolverinish ? Maybe .. but that 's not the interesting part of this film . Shunned all his life and driven by anger ( and a temper he does have ) our " hero " returns to his home town to turn his life around or find a reason to . The only thing he encounters here is trouble when an encounter with an old flame 's new boyfriend leaves him bloodied on the ground . This is where the vengeance and anger comes into play . This is a man you do not want to cross and from this point the mafia and the police are on his tail . He meets a girl and falls in love instantly as does she and this is really what the movie is about . The film is highly impressionistic with bold colors and noir overtones spliced with short yet extreme action sequences . This is art house at it 's core , beautifully filmed with such attention to details in every scene over gruesome sci-fi action . It 's this odd mash that interests me so much in this film . The directors approach for this genre is refreshing focusing on the emotional journey of Sasha and not a straight action film . Don't worry though , the action is there and plenty of it . However , much of these sequences show only implied violence with pictures of the horrific aftermath . This is not to say that action is not shown . These scenes are here and are fantastic ( especially the ending where we see Sasha 's full powers unleashed in desperation ) . The director chooses to imply the violence of many scenes to keep the focus on the character 's emotional struggle at hand . This is a tragic love story and a refreshing entry into the genre .  
  While I do not think this was a perfect 10 , I do agree it was way above a 6 which is what it 's rated here . No , Brokedown Palace was not perfect and yes it 's plot has been done many times before . That doesn't mean it shouldn't be done again if it is done well and I think this movie had some strong moments . The acting of Claire Danes , as already mentioned many times , was flawless as was Kate Beckinsell and I Think Bill Pullman was absolutely terrific as was the supporting performances ( Pullman 's wife , the crooked cop , skip or trip or whatever his name is ) . The cinematography was also beautifully filmed , there was a lot that 's good to this movie even if there were some negatives ( three major ones that I found ) as well . Here is what I didn't like about it-the friendship between the girls-In fact , the girls ' own individual personalities-were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic . It would not have been improbable to lose interest before then , because , despite the positives , more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested , were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much Jumping around without the character and scene development I think would have been appropriate for this type of film . That , however , is not my major problem . And WARNING-SPOILER ALERT . The ending as mentioned dozens of times already , was AWFUL . It was awful in two respects . Firstly , even though it would have been predictable and very Hollywood , I wanted a happy ending ! Yes , it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this , there is a Sense that justice will be served and I did sit through it to see that . I was Genuinely shocked at the ending and It was performed with excellence by all involved but I feel both girls should have got out or , barring that , at least the cop should have got what was coming to him . I mean nothing happens To the bad guys , they all get away with it . Very disturbing . Also , I do not understand the ambiguity of the ending . I understand endings that are inspired to make one think , but this was not a mystery or " Clue " type movie we were watching , and I would have liked to know something about what actually happened , who was guilty etc , with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since I somehow doubt there will be a sequel , I did not want to be kept guessing . Still , there was a lot to like about this movie , and the acting is definitely at the top of the list , I would rate this a 7.5 and say it is definitely worth a look .  
  I like films that don't provide the typical " happy ending , " and that 's my main reason for my liking of this movie . Alice Marano ( Danes ) and her best friend Darlene ( Beckinsale ) are arrested in Thailand for narcotics smuggling after a tip anonymously phoned in to the Thai authorities . The film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as to whether ( or which ) of the girls was involved , and Bill Pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer . Jacqueline Kim turns in a terrific performance as his more kind , magnanimous wife , Yon , who is also an attorney . I wish the girls had been abused more in the prison , as another commenter has suggested , as I 've heard that Thai prisons can be quite brutal . Where this film grabs me , however , is its ending . Alice subjects herself to a sentence of 96 years in total so that Darlene can be pardoned , and we ( the viewers ) realize that they are both innocent . Any film that defies my expectation of the ending wins extra points with me , and this well-acted drama is certainly deserving .  
  I watched the movie while recovering from major surgery . While I knew it was only a " B " film , a space western , I loved it . It may have lacked the flash of high dollar productions it non-the-less held my imagination and provided great escapism . Sadly our society has so much available , discounting small attempts is too easy . In the same way that I can enjoy a even a grade school performance of Shakespeare , I can appreciate many levels of achievement for the art sake . I am a cop and found affinity with the retired LAPD . Dreams like his haunt me that I will be unable in the moment of crisis be able to respond to save another 's life ( or my own ) . while it was a romantic ending where Farnsworth did take out the bad guy ( predictable ) I needed a little happy romance where good can triumph . My world is really too cynical .  
  This 2004 Oscar nominee is a very short b / w film in Spanish . A young woman goes into a café , gets a coffee , and notices a couple of musicians standing silently with their instruments . All the patrons are motionless , like mannequins . One guy , however , is quite jolly and breaks into a song about what goes on at 7:35 in the morning . There is one surprising moment after another until the end which is quite , well , surprising . The people , the place , everything looks quite ordinary . And like the musical piece " Bolero " , the thing keeps building until the climax . With its structure , theme , movement and wit , it is an 8 minute masterpiece .  
  I must admit that this is the type of film that I would normally eschew , but I rented it basically because of the stars . I certainly was not sorry . In fact , as you see , I rated it five stars . This film is the perfect combination of sharp directing and superior acting . Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who decide to commit the uncouth crime of robbing their parents ' jewelry store . The crime goes terribly wrong - thus beginning an examination of the three men in the Hanson family . Through a series of flashbacks , we get to know Charles Hanson and come to an understanding of the strained relationship between father and sons . Younger brother , Hank is basically a screw-up . He has always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind . Hank is insecure , cowardly , and very much under the influence of his big brother . Ethan Hawke has the character of Hank " nailed to a T " and gives what is probably his best performance thus far . He shows us a man who is basically good-hearted but so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to follow through with any important task . Andy - on the surface - appears to be a successful businessman , but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has been embezzling from his company to pay for his habit . It is Andy who concocts the scheme to rob his parents ' store , and he gets weak-willed Hank to commit the act . Philip Seymour Hoffman - surely one of the finest actors of our time - plays Andy . Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who , on the surface , is a charming businessman liked by his acquaintances but a real slime ball underneath . He is absolutely perfect for the part of Andy or it might be said that he , through his superior acting skills , made Andy the perfect part . Albert Finney plays a father common to his generation . Charles Hanson is not a bad or unfeeling man , but he has a lousy relationship with his sons because he never really understood what was necessary in nurturing a positive bond between his sons and himself . He has always been too quick to criticize and admonish . He always made it clear that he favored his younger son over his older thus causing a wide emotional rift between himself and Andy . As we get to know Charles and Andy , the thought of Andy forming a plan to rob from his father becomes less unbelievable . On a personal note , I cannot believe how much Charles Hanson reminded me of my own father , and how much Andy and Hank reminded me of my own brother and myself . Perhaps this may be one of the reasons that I enjoyed the film so much as this story of a distant , critical father , a more successful older brother , and a less successful younger brother hit so close to home . Fortunately , my brother and I never came to the state of committing a crime against my parents - guess we were made of sterner and more moral stuff . This complex of personalities and actions has been expertly put together by director , Sidney Lumet . At eighty-three , he still has the chops to give the audience engrossing characters and edge-of-seat action that hypnotizes . 12 Angry Men was his first film made fifty years prior to Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead , but he hasn't lost any bit of his magic touch in showing us characters that will be long remembered . The events and characters in Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead are harsh and unattractive , and this is definitely not a feel-good movie . However , it is two hours of ultimate entertainment which I thoroughly recommend .  
  Of life in ( some ) colleges . Of course there were artistic licenses taken , but some of what you saw in this film go on in some colleges . I went to colleges in Southern California where the races pretty much hang around with their own . It 's funny because these are schools that want racial unity , equality etc . and I can honestly say , that it 's there . But the thing is when class lets out , or when they 're just hanging out waiting for class , they ( students ) seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity . Is that bad ? Not really . Everyone needs a feeling of belonging . But like the school paper of one of the schools I attended once wrote about that , " we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them . " Otherwise you 're creating your own segregation . Racism certainly existed in one of those schools I attended . One time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the Aryan Race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations . Fortunately , nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young Caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gathering . I can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happen . So is " Higher Learning " overly dramatic ? Exaggerated ? Maybe . Is it way " off mark ? " It depends on where you went to or go to school . The race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own DOES happen . Minus the Hollywood exaggerations , the race thing hit pretty close to home for me .  
  The film 's design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country ( U.S. ) . We see relationships all over at the university setting for the film . Befittingly , the obvious of student v . s . teacher is present . But what the film adds to its value is its other relationships : male v . s . female , white v . s . black , and the individual v . s . society . But most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v . s . himself . I was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus . Most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other . This film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides . It did not attempt to show how either was right , although I would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive ( quite obvious towards the end ) . The film also discusses sex and rape . It is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together , for a time . Lawrence Fishburne does an over-the-top performance as the sagacious Profesor Phipps . He crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down-trodden with the industrious and positive . Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps , Ice Cube , and Jennifer Connelly . Michael Rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance . Tyra Banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act . Higher Learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper . In fact , I would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other , rather than some dry book , as the real education at a university . It is a life-learning process , not a textual one . I think you 'll find " Higher Learning " is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general . 8/10  
  Films such as Chocolat , Beau Travail , and others have propelled French director Claire Denis into the top echelon of the world 's most unique and accomplished filmmakers and her 2004 film The Intruder ( L'Intrus ) adds to the depth of her portfolio . A cinematic poem that conveys a mood of abiding loneliness and loss , the film provides a glimpse into the psyche of a man who is deteriorating physically and mentally and who travels to various parts of the globe seeking redemption and peace but finds it hard to come by . Loosely based on Jean-Luc Nancy 's memoir of a heart transplant , The Intruder is a film of such unrelenting opaqueness that even after two viewings it is difficult to describe it in other than subjective , impressionistic terms . Louis Trebor ( Michael Subor ) is a man in his seventies who is likely dying of a heart condition and who , like the professor in Ingmar Bergman 's Wild Strawberries , attempts to come to terms with the mistakes of his life while he has time . It is clear that he is physically rugged and very wealthy but seems emotionally drained and the look on his face is one of quiet resignation . Though we see only one episode of violence , where he gets out of bed in the middle of night to kill an intruder , there is a sinister sense about him . He might be an intelligence officer , a foreign agent , or a hit man . Whatever the case , he apparently is under some kind of surveillance and acts like a man that has been involved in criminal wrongdoing and is only now able to see the consequences . Facial close-ups throughout the movie create a strong sense of isolation . He lives with his dogs in a cabin in the Jura Mountains near the French-Swiss border and has an estranged son Sidney ( Gregoire Collin ) whom he has long neglected . Sidney lives nearby with his wife Antoinette ( Florence Loiret-Caille ) and their two children . In one telling scene , he meets up with his father on the street and calls him a lunatic , but that does not prevent him from taking his money . When the film opens , we meet Antoinette , a Swiss border guard , who boards a van with a trained dog to sniff out some contraband . When she comes home , she is greeted by her husband who asks her with tongue-in-cheek if she has " anything to declare ? " Other than these three individuals , the people and circumstances we see during the rest of the film may exist only in Louis ' imagination . Louis has three women in his life and we meet them all in the film 's first half hour : a pharmacist ( Bambou ) who prepares his medication , a neighbor ( Béatrice Dalle ) who is a dog breeder who refuses to care for his dogs when he goes away on a trip telling him that they are as crazy as he is , and a young Russian organ dealer ( Katia Golubeva ) who he tells he wants a " young man 's heart " . Relentlessly , she stalks him throughout the film but it is apparently only in his mind . In the last section of the film , Louis travels to South Korea in search of a heart transplant and to Tahiti to deliver a gift to a different son , one whom he has not seen for many years or perhaps has never seen . His heart transplant , however , appears to be a metaphor for a man without a heart , a man whose life has been fascinating but ultimately directionless , intruding into other people 's lives with little real empathy . The Intruder contains a haunting guitar soundtrack by Stuart Staples of the band Tindersticks , reminiscent of the guitar riff in Jim Jarmusch 's Dead Man , and gorgeous cinematography by Denis regular Agnes Godard . Godard creates memorable images that convey a mood of longing and regret : a heart beating alone in the snow , an infant in a sling looking up at his father for a good two minutes , the baby 's expression gradually turning from morose to a half smile , colored streamers blowing from a newly christened ship , a massage in a dark room by a mysterious Korean masseuse , and the vast expanse of ocean seen from a bobbing ship deck . While The Intruder can be frustrating because of its elliptical nature , Denis forces us to respond out of our own experience , to understand the images on the screen on a very personal level . If there is any theme , a hint might be found in the opening that tells us what is revealed piecemeal in the film - " your worst enemies are hiding , in the shadow , in your heart . "  
  sammo has to have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything . great story , great fights , great characters and great cameos . this film sees dick wei take on billy chow and chong fat . sammo takes on lau kar leung in a casino , sammo loses the fight but what a fight it is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown in . some great and touching moments in the film , lam ching ying pops up in a cameo and gets killed off - gutted . the end sequence will have you reaching for the rewind button , as its one of the best end fights I 've seen . sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up squaring up to billy chow .  
  A documentary about two rocks bands , spanning a number of years . Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols . What makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure . Anton Newcombe , the main man of Brian Jonestown Massacre , is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues , his friends and rivals the Dandy Warhols , but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him . Sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world . Newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience ( getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan ) . Newcombe knows no limits  he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments , writes and produces all BJM 's music , can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day , has a prophet-like obsessiveness with his own musical genius , but is also a heavy drugs user , flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity , orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life , and can blow deals as fast as he makes them . BJM go through a large number of record labels in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise Newcombe 's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable . The Warhols acknowledge their debt to Newcombe 's creativity and don't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness  but the Warhols have something that BJM don't  the ability to integrate their talents with common sense , the real world , and their market  as a mixing pot of talent ( even if much of it is distilled from guru Newcombe ) and accessibility , they are the very definition of ' cool . ' DiG ! follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy . At one point , Newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the Warhols ( in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap ' to clean up their act ' )  only he forgets to tell them it 's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against Newcombe . By the time the Dandy Warhols take off in Europe with hits like ' Every Day Should Be A Holiday ' and ' Bohemian Like You ' , Newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated . BJM are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the Warhols get busted for drugs around the same time , let off with a warning , and even allowed to keep the grass . The wider appeal of DiG ! is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music . The downside is that it is still a documentary , however intimate , and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands . Newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius , and there are feint glimpses of this in the film , but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this . In the words of one of the band members : " In every spiritual tradition , you burn in hell for pretending to be God and not being able to back it up . " Newcombe isn't pretending  but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime , and DiG ! has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius .  
  This film does a superb job of depicting the plight of an ALS ( Lou Gehrig 's Disease ) sufferer . The subject is done with compassion as well as humor . Helena Bonham Carter is so convincing as a person with ALS that I found it hard to believe that she was only acting . Kenneth Branagh , a superb actor , lives up to expectations as the quirky artist who misbehaves and is forced to provide companionship to Helena 's character as part of his " community service " , an alternative to prison time . Watching the development of the relationship between these two is a treat from beginning to end . Tha fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances . One comes to care deeply for the two of them .  
  A true wholesome American story about teenagers who are interested in launching their own rocket in a rural West Virginia coal mining town , after the launch of Sputnik in 1957 . Through trial , tribulations and perseverance beyond belief , they are ultimately able to achieve their goals . Jake Gyllenhaal , as the leader of the group , is excellent in the title role . As his motivating science teacher , Laura Linney is quite good but her southern accent is over the top . There is a standout supporting performance by Chris Cooper , a head miner , who wants his son to follow in his footsteps , but gradually comes around at film 's end . What makes this film so unusual for our times is that there are no bed-hopping scenes and no profanity whatsoever . It is the epitome of an American story that is well done . Besides the science angle , we have the father-son disagreement , football scholarships as a way to escape coal mining , and the loving spirit of family . Why aren't pictures like this recognized more at award times ?  
  There is an old saying that relates to the rousing new film by Joe Johnston that goes something like this : " The man who thinks he can and the man who thinks he can't are both right . " That is a highly presumptuous statement referring to self motivating and belief in an individual , which , in this movie , stand true even after road blocks and family trouble stand in the way . " October Sky " is about a young man who believes in himself named Homer Hickam , growing up in a strict , traditional family in the 1950 's . Homer loves in a small coal mining town where nearly every man grows up to be a miner . All of his friends , Quentin , Roy , and O'Dell all think that their life after high school will be like everyone else 's . Homer is not exited about that future . One night , while everyone stares at the sky , a Russian space craft called Sputnik passes overhead . This is something new for Homer , and he finds it spectacular and overwhelming . From this point on , his look at life will never be the same . First , he tells everyone that he wants to work in the rocket scientist area for an occupation . Flabbergasted at what he says , his family passes that idea over their heads and continues with life as usual His friends , however , think that this idea may have some potential . After all , Quentin is a very smart individual when it comes to this kind of thing . When the four friends start to test model rockets , and blow a white picket fence to smithereens , then what seems to be a forest fire is scared by them , they 're forced to end their progresses . The performances in this movie are absolutely riveting from start to finish . All of the actors give performances as if this is the real mumbo jumbo here . Standing out in all of the glory : Laura Dern as Miss Riley . This very well may be Academy award material if the judges can remember back to the beginning of the year when this film is released . The characters are also extremely well developed . Not only to the filmmakers give clear , apparent reason why Homer is interested in the subject , but they also explain to the audience how they are succeeding in their studding of rocketry . We clearly understand all of the characters ' motives and beliefs , especially the father , who is bent over on everlasting tradition . The film , unfortunately , loses some of its momentum at mid-point because of a silly , recycled romantic sub-plot involving Homer 's love interest and how his brother stole her from him . This type of this is becoming so awfully common in high-school movies , not that this film is aimed at high-schoolers . The actors stare at each other mindlessly , like the are in a trance . I put up with it without complaining in 1997 's " Inventing the Abbots , " but I have had just about enough this . But that is just a minor complaint . With an authentic looking time period , cinematography worth an Oscar and clips of the real life Homer and friends at the end , whom all hit it big with their dreams , especially Homer , this is the first great film of 1999 .  
  I was watching this when my wife called to inquire from the other room as to my choice of fare . My comment ? " I am watching my Life ! " Though younger , but only by 5 years or so , than the " Rocket Boys " I remember the absolute urgency with which Sputnick was greeted by our administrators of education and how the whole Science Fair thing gained momentum and took me and others into the competitive whirlwind . My own tornado landed me in my own State 's Science Fair , in Physics by ' 62 , though our group was less successful in gaining the support of , for example , firefighters we approached for guidance and counsel until after a tragic event , our city went so far as to allow us to tour the Nike missile site on Chicago 's lakeshore . This movie brought it all back for me and I will bet that it brought it all back for a bunch of us " UberNerds " of the late ' 50s and early 60 's . We are in a similar science brain drainage period now and really need this movie as a country . See It !  
  I saw this independent film when it was in Philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise . I left the theater with a smile on my face . One of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true story - hilarious ! It has some great character actors in it too . Mindy Sterling is in it and is very good . I loved her in Austin Powers . Howard Hesseman is also terrific . I remember him from Head of the Class . I am tired of all the dark edgy movies that keep getting made . This is fun and light , and I can watch it with my family and not be embarrassed . I keep checking to see when it will come out on DVD . I will definitely buy it .  
  Well i do disagreed with the other comment posted . Piedras is much much better them Magnolia or any of the other films that were mentioned . specially about non real characters , i think that someone just wrote that only because he never lived in the Spanish society like i did ( and i 'm not Spanish ) , is a very real film with real characters , very well done by one of the best Spanish actress Antonia San Juan . about be a European film in contrast with an American film , well we different societies , personally i dislike American modern films a lot ( i like the classics and some of the Andy American films but they are very few ) . Is a film about the continuous Constitution of a person , liked or not we all make mistakes but some can learn about the mistakes .  
  The idea ia a very short film with a lot of information . Interesting , entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more . The producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that cannot be compared to any other short film that I have seen . I have rated this film at the highest possible rating . I also recommend that it is shown to office managers and business people in any establishment . What comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to , their voice is never heard . It is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to go forward . I hope that the produced will produce a second part to this ' idea ' . I look forward to viewing the sequence . Once again congrats to Halaqah media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind .  
  I 'll start by relating my first encounter with Prince 's music . It was in a bar , on my 39th birthday and a girl was dancing bare breasted to " 1999 " playing on the speakers . I asked people , who is this singer ? I was told it was Prince . It was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful , topless dancer . Later I started hearing other Prince songs and really " digging " them . When Purple Rain came out I still knew very little about this fellow Minnesotan . The movie blew me away . I instantly became Prince 's No . 1 fan of the " War Baby " generation . Later I found out one of my cousins was his secretary , and she got me , and my nephew into a V.I.P. Prince concert where we sat next to his mother .. how cool is that ! Getting back to the topic at hand , I agree with Siskel & Ebert who called Purple Rain an instant classic . I have seen it over 17 times and absolutely love it . I thought Prince 's acting was fine , Apollonia struggled a bit , but all in all the acting was fine . John Gielgud was not available to play ' The Kid ' so Prince took the role . The film is visually stunning , brilliantly paced ( it never gets slow ) , and terrifically directed . I rank it among the Best Movie Musicals of all time . The last time I watched it was after about a 7 year gap and it still delivered . I am so proud of fellow Minnesotan Prince Rogers Nelson and would love to tell him personally . He walked right in front of me during the above mentioned concert and said , " Hi " , to my nephew but not me . He was chatting with his mom . I was a bit crushed but he 's still No . 1 with me .  
  I have recently seen this production on DVD . It is the first time I have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as I remembered . At first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and I suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the BBC serials were back then . ( I miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on Sunday afternoons back then ) But that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been . I am a bit of a " Jane Eyre " purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one . I have recently re-read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on . Reading the scene near the end where Rochester questions Jane about what St John was like I noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by Dalton and Clarke and done perfectly . All the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way , some even leave out the " Rivers " family and their connection to Jane altogether . I also think this is the only production to include the " Gypsy " scene done correctly . The casting is perfect , Zelah Clarke is like Jane is described in the book " small plain and dark " and I disagree that she looked too old . Timothy Dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as Rochester , portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off ! I agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time , like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted , his expression is fantastically frightening . But then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when Jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another . A love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable . Oh to be loved by a man like that ! There were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however , like when Jane climbs in to bed with the dying Helen and also when Rochester takes Jane shopping for her wedding things ( I thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks ) . Finally if you never see another production of Jane Eyre - you simply most see this one it is simply perfection !  
  My Comments for VIVAH : - Its a charming , idealistic love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao . The film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom 's families sleeping on the floor , playing games together , their friendly banter and mutual respect . Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals . Yes , the central romance is naively visualized . But the sneaked-in romantic moments between the to-be-married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism . The film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom , on the wedding night , tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries : " Come let me do your dressing " V I V A H - showcases a lot of good things - beauty of arranged marriage , beauty of Indian culture , beauty of Indian woman , last but not least a nice IDEALISM of the about to be couple waiting to get married .. playing by the rules ! Simple yet Beautiful ; Such a Simple story .. no plot .. no villain - as is the case with most of Sooraj Barjatya films . Sooraj sir is back to what he does BEST . He has made the movie with FULL CONVICTION . Its a very sweet film - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout Arranged Marriage & the Union of 2 Families . I think AMRITA RAO - looks very good & she has acted very well . She has most of the good scenes - although i thought the last half hour was completely to Shahid Kapur - who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance . I also liked the acting of all others for ex . the Choti i . e . Amrita Prakash , Alok Nath , Anupam Kher , Shahid 's bro & sis-in-law . It almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could . Sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after Maine Pyar Kiya , HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain . The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is AWESOME . Stuff like Sanctity in a Marriage / Relationship , Avoiding Courtship , Mutual Respect , Care & Space , Waiting for getting Married " officially " , Praying / Sacrficing for Ur Beloved - all these and more get SHOWCASED in Vivah . There 's still some good audience who r going & enjoying this film . Some of the folks / audience are already excited after seeing , that they r thinking bout Arranged-Marriage : ) Thats Success if you ask me . it seems AMRITA RAO - our actress-from-Vivah { Result for a nice performance } has been bestowed the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award for 2006 ! Hats off to her for this achievement Chalo , even though Vivah , Shahid or Amrita didn't get any of the film-fare & other awards ; @ least this is news to CHEER about ! Congrats to AMRITA RAO - for showing us a visual of Indian Bride-to-be in the purest form and Of Course to Sooraj Barjatya for portraying her the best way : ) Shudn't forget Shahid Kapur and all others who make VIVAH as sweet and legendary as it is today ! Imagine , to share the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar .. Its no mean achievement ! Congrats to Amrita Rao - for taking her Career to another level with this award .. I personally feel - she should keep doing movies only with Shahid Kapur ! They make a cute couple and their on-screen chemistry reminds me of { SRK-Kajol } or { Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla } .. Some points that I observed , few of the elements : - # 1 If u notice carefully , Amrita Rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses . She gives every bit of the Indian Woman essence - in this film ! Perfect Fit # 2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us - not exactly ready for marriage or early-marriage .. but PREM listens carefully to the step-wise talk given by his DAD - having full faith in Anupam Kher . Eventually " Honesty " & " Trust " are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with Amrita . Most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person . But according to what I saw in this film , I have a feeling - that Two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also , Its possible ! # 3 In the entire movie - there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where Shahid & Amrita are together - or shown to be together . Its unlike most other romantic / wedding-based movies where Hero & Heroine are always singing / dancing or nowadays - doing cheap stuff . But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences : - Characterized by restraint , innocence & respect for the other ! # 4 I really liked the relationship shown between Chacha ALOK NATH & Amrita Rao . These kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters / girl-kids in some parts of India . # 5 Romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely - no cheap scenes , songs are beautifully pictured ! Words like " Jal " , " praarthana " e . t . c . are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film : ) Personally , I really am fond of many dialogs in this film . # 6 Last but not the least - The entire Hospital Scene where Shahid puts " sindhoor " to Amrita when shes struggling for Life - is terrific . Those dialogs between the couple are so touching and U feel the LOVE / I cant do without U ; Its a Hats-Off feeling ! * In many ways , VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya , DDLJ , Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak , Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - for the freshness / on-screen-chemistry of the LEAD pair : ) : ) * IF U ASK ME : - Along with films like Rang De Basanti , Lage Raho Munnabhai , DOR , CORPORATE and Kabul Express , V I V A H ranks among the best films made in 2006 . IN FACT - i think Vivah does deserve better viewing / business than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all those time-pass / fuzzy / style / crap movies !  
  B Movie ? Yes . DIY ? Yes . First Movie ? Yes . But Aestheically A + . This movie definitely had some bad sound / editing / lighting / acting / etc . etc . problems . However , this movie has many positive things about it . First off , the most annoying character dies first ! Second , its made to be a parody / funny B Rated Horror movie . The comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling around on the floor laughing . The problem is a lot of people try to take every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece . Take it for what it is , a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie . For what it is , just that , it is really good .  
  Yesterday , I went alone to the cinema , because here in Mexico , most of the times movies from other countries are part of the so called " camára alternativa " ( alternative camera ) . But after I saw this movie , I realized that not all the foreign movies are alternative . Afortunately , this is a good a example . But I have to said that I enjoyed so much this movie .. that at the end I was happy .. this movie is a little spoon of hope in these days . And the main lesson for me .. is that at the end of the day .. the love is main force behind us . This is a good option to see a good movie in Spanish .. and I have to mention the good music .. specially the main song of the movie .. Cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena .. Excellent song !  
  Once again , I was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $ 4.88 . Fifty-percent of the time the movies I find in the bin are pure crap ( I mean horrible beyond belief ) but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good . This movie is much better than I expected . I found it very engaging , though it was obviously made by an amateur . The direction is nothing special , but the story is intriguing with some good thrills . I expected it to be more of a comedy , but I wasn't too disappointed . For a thriller , this movie is surprisingly good-natured . There 's no bloody violence , no profanity , no nudity , no sex . Usually , these movies require all four of those elements . The PG rating is well-deserved-not like " Sixteen Candles " where the " f " word is used twice and there 's a brief gratuitous nude scene . I just wish the romance between Corey Haim and his love interest could 've been developed more . The film does tend to be plot-heavy , and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side . Instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them , we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors . They end up kissing at the end , but there 's so little chemistry that it seems forced . " The Dream Machine " is no gem , but it 's good , clean entertainment . It 's quite forgettable-especially with a cast of unknowns , except for Haim-but it 's also much better than you 'd expect . My score : 7 ( out of 10 )  
  I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this . In fact , it 's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with - but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did . The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time , one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that 's going on behind the walls of the stadium . It makes you feel like you are in the movie and you 're one of the characters , and while watching the movie , as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match . You will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie . It 's gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending , you will want to find out the verdict , you 'll be dying to see what will happen to the girls . I like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee . It 's like venus VS mars , it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran . This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen ( the first being Crimson Gold ) and am looking forward to watching some more . Am already hooked with Iranian movies and this one is a must-see !  
  True , the idea for this TV series may have sprung from the immense success which Ally McBeal is enjoying worldwide , even here in Germany . However , this said , Edel & Starck is very different from Ally McBeal in many ways . The two main characters work beautifully together . Felix Edel ( Felix Noble ) , played by well-known German actor , Christoph M . Ohrt and Sandra Starck ( Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong , get it ? ) , played by charming Rebecca Immanuel , exchange quick romantic repartees and continually spy on each other while engaging in sitcom-like criminal cases in Berlin and surroundings . Further , they are aided by a magnificent cast of co-stars , most notably their secretary , played by Isabel Tuengerthal , who is a rare gem with GREAT comic potential . Also the shady wheeler-dealer , Otto , and the noble childhood pal of Felix , Frank , work very well , not to forget Sandra 's best friend and room-mate , Patricia , played by the beautiful Barbara Demmer . All-in-all a joy to watch on Monday nites : no wonder that the series and its stars have received several prizes . Will Felix get Sandra ? I hope that we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out ..  
  * Possible Spoiler * Adam Sandler is usually typecast in Comedy , but in " Reign " , gives a deeply moving performance . While there are people who showed Courage facing post September 11,2001 , Sandler plays Fineman , a widower who is lonely and " lost in his own world " . Johnson ( Cheadle ) , a practicing dentist , encounters his old College buddy ( Sandler ) and wants to catch up on " Old times " . We see , as in Rain Man ( Dustin Hoffman ) , Fineman also gets emotional and withdrawn in stressful situations . Oldies music , appears to be a comfort and " Psychological " crutch for him to lean on . Johnson looks for , in Fineman , that certain pleasure and ease missing in his Family . He also feels unhappy and unsatisfied in his Job . In the same instance , He also wants to make sure his friend does not fall through the social " cracks " . I came away from this movie , with a different outlook and more sympathetic Compassion for grieving families .  
  I just got back from a screening a couple of hours ago , and I was very happy with the movie when I left it . It 's very intense , and the closest I 've come to crying in a movie in quite some time . That is a credit to Adam Sandler , who delivers a magnificent performance on many levels , and who probably deserves an Oscar nom for it , were it not coming out so early in the year . Don Cheadle gives his usual superb performance playing the straight man to Adam 's disturbed . There is some humor , but most of it is really only funny in comparison to the tearjerking moments , as Adam deals with his loss and Don struggles to help him . Adam plays two levels very well .. when he is mentally stable he is funny and likable , but when he is , well , less stable he 's powerful and dark . I recommend it for anyone who likes intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss .  
  Although George C . Scott is the only actor in this version of ACC without a British accent , he more than makes up for it with his over-the-top and larger-than-life interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge . Particularly effective is when he confronts Bob Cratchit in his office at the movie 's end . As Scott stands before a large window , sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him ; all you can see is his silhouette . Augmented by Scott 's voice , a ponderous growl , the effect is galvanizing .. much like Marlon Brando 's first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW . " The Horror , " indeed ! However , as they say , the very thing that works for you can also work against you . Because Scott displays such gleeful ferocity throughout the movie , it proves infectious . To put it another way , the " before " Scrooge is almost as charismatic as the " after , " even though he really shouldn't be . It 's what you might call the " Doctor Smith " effect , since Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when playing that role and numerous other heavies ( stage and screen alike ) . Actually , I myself don't consider Scott 's glib rage a liability . But other " Christmas Carol " purists might . See the film and judge for yourselves .  
  When a movie shocks you with it 's disturbing , brooding atmosphere , and grabs you by the throat with it 's stunning cinematography , you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat , masterpiece of a film . Although with most modern movies , extremely enjoyable as some are , those that really shock you into focus are the strongest , and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly , stick with you for a life time . I say , proudly , that I am a fan of movies that disturb , not just horror movies , but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding . Movies like Breakdown and The Missing , that send a chill down your spine , making you think " holy crap , that could happen to me " , and visually entice you , are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie . Because I am only 21 , I did not grow up with actors like Burt Renyolds , Jon Voight and Ned Beatty , albeit I am familiar with them , I didn't watch them grow and proceed as actors , as opposed to actors now like Shia LaBouf and Justin Long . I must say , after the long hype and witnessing Deliverance for the first time , I was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago , and still lives it 's terror up in competition to modern movies . Burt Renyolds plays Lewis , the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made , filling the whole wilderness in water . Renyolds ' character is an experienced adventurer , sort of no nonsense , and filled with machismo . Witnessing him portray the tough guy , made me think differently about him as an actor , as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician . The dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader . Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty play as the novice adventurers , Drew and Bob respectively , joining in for the fun of a canoe trip . The actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was Jon Voight , once again I have only seen him as an older actor , however , unlike Renyolds , I have quite liked Voight 's acting ( and i don't regard Anaconda when I say that ) , for example the national treasure movies . Voight plays Ed , whom , like Lewis , is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character , a reluctant hero / leader and definitely lacks Lewis ' machismo . The film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside . You immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to , like the imbred kid who plays the infamous " Duelling Banjo 's " at the start of the film with Ronny Cox 's character Drew ; and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene . As with all atmospheric movies , from this moment on , dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form . The canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature 's odds for survival . The film 's cinematics do not let up , and I back that comment up with the scene in which Ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow . As Ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him , cocks his rifle , only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck ; was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting I have seen in a film . In wrapping up , Deliverance is one film , who 's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date , remains one of the best films in cinematic history .  
  I watch romantic comedies with some hesitation , for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie uninteresting . Typically in a Romantic Comedy , there is a girl and there is a guy , both fall in love , then have troubles , and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever . But , this movie is a different story , it is really very different from the Romantic Comedies I have seen of lately . There is a widowed guy ( Dan ) , there is a girl ( Marie ) . Dan meets Marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime , after sometime Marie has to leave . Dan develops something for her , and when this something starts to turn meaningful , we get a twist . Marie is the girlfriend of his brother . Unheeded of the circumstances , Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her , and even Marie loves him , but their love would not just be possible . How it is made possible forms the rest of the story . Steve Carell performs well , Juliette Binoche is good as Marie . And every other stuff is done well . It is a good movie , watch it .  
  I saw a special advance screening of this today . I have to let you know , I 'm not a huge fan of either Dane Cook or Steve Carell , so I really had no expectations going into this . I ended up enjoying it quite a bit . Dan in Real Life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family . While at a bookstore , he meets the woman of his dreams , only to find out that she happens to be his brother 's girlfriend . This movie is pretty well made - the soundtrack , cinematography , and acting are all top-notch , especially Steve Carell . My problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development , mostly with Dane Cook 's character . We never really get a close look at the relationship between Dane and Steve 's characters , and I felt that it could have helped a bit in showing what Dan 's inner conflict about being in love with Dane 's girlfriend was like . Other than this though , Dan in Real Life is definitely a solid , sweet film - definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we 've been getting this year .  
  This is one of the best movies I 've ever seen . It has very good acting by Hanks , Newman , and everyone else . Definitely Jude Law 's best performance . The cinematography is excellent , the editing is about as good , and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie . The production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special . To me , it takes a lot to beat Godfather , but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest . Definitely a Best Picture nominee in my book .  
  While many unfortunately passed on , the ballroom scene is still very much alive and carrying on their legacy . Some are still very much alive and quite well , Octavia is more radiant and beautiful than ever , Willi Ninja is very accomplished and gives a great deal of support to the gay community as a whole , Pepper Labeija just passed on last year of natural cause , may she rest in peace . After Anji 's passing Carmen became the mother of the house of Xtravaganza ( she was in the beach scene ) and she is looking more and more lovely as well . Some balls have categories dedicated to those who have passed , may they all rest in peace . There is currently another project underway known as " How Do I Look ? " , you can check out the website at ww . howdoilooknyc . org .  
  Warning ! Spoilers ahead ! SPOILERS I 've seen movie in German , so it might be , that I missed some clues . Despite some weakness in the plot , it 's a movie that came through to me . I liked especially Lexa Doig 's acting . Sometimes I got impression , that she * is * Camille . But I can't stop wondering , what happened at the end with Bob , Cassie and baby . I belive , she , after initially being set on Bob , eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him . Otherwise it 's a bit strange , that she would carry his baby and love it . It 's up to viewer to decide - and I don't like such endings . Dean Cain was as good as ever , Eric Roberts .. well , I 've seen him better but also worse . I believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime story . Bottom line is , I liked it very much .  
  The movie is very realistic . Absolutely , it does not belong to the Hollywood Cinema genre where every line must be pronounced in a perfect manner and where every move is precise . The actors playing the roles of the lovers do a GREAT job representing the characters ' feelings and thoughts - their everyday life adventures . Overall , the movie climaxes the viewer to a depressed state . This is where the realism of the whole story is apparent . Not everything happens the way we think it should happen . I can say though that the movie does not end on a bad note . We watch , we learn , we experience ourselves . That is probably the moral of this story .  
  I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me , I cannot understand why some people compare this to BABE . This film is not about the secret life of ALL animals who secretly can talk . Instead , it is about a Parrot who learns to talk to help his owner , a little girl with a serious stammer , overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heart-wrenching scene early on . Then the great journey begins . Paulie the Parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend , Marie . Along the way , he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people . He falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her . He gets conned into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him . He recounts his tale to a sympathetic Janitor in the Lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved Marie . Tony Shaloub shines as the kindly Janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who determines to help little Paulie despite the risks . Jay Mohr plays the voice of the Parrot AND one of the seedy characters he comes across . There is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too . It is a witty , clever , epic animal-adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a Bird and his little girl . He search for Marie ends with a quite an unexpected surprise for most people who don ; t know much about Parrots . Kids who have seen the wild Green Parrot Tribes in Los Angeles and Pasadena will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that Birds , especially Parrots are not disposable pets . All children everywhere , will see that Pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured . so no BABE here , more of an incredible journey with a twist . Enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts .  
  A fantastic show and an unrealized classic ; The League of Gentlemen remains as one of the greatest modern comedies of recent times . With a dark and bizarre style of humor that towers over the tired , formulaic approach of it 's inferior , yet unfortunately far more acknowledged successor , Little Britain , The League of Gentlemen was truly something special during a rather quiet era in British comedy . Up until it 's arrival on the scene , there had never really been anything like The League of Gentlemen before . On the surface , a seemingly simplistic sketch show , the show soon unfolds as a vivid , sinister but incredibly hilarious universe populated with all manner of brilliant comedic creations . What really sets the show apart from it 's rivals , is it 's approach to telling us it 's story . Rather than serve us re-hashed sketches , barely distinguishable from the next , here we see each individual or group of characters go through their various journeys and story lines . No visit to them is the same , and each time they offer us up with a surprise . Gradually , over three series ' and a Christmas special , the fictional town of Royston Vasey is heaving with a grotesque yet hilarious populace . And that 's probably the main reason why the show is such a joy to watch ( and also the reason why the show would easily merit more series ' ) Unlike other current shows like The Catherine Tate Show or more importantly Little Britain , the League both know when a character has run it 's course , and have the opportunity to deal with that . Several fan favorite 's , who could have easily been kept on to entertain further , bowed out before the series came to a close , giving room for fellow characters to grow more , or allow for the introduction of newer residents of Royston Vasey to make their mark . Another thing that sets this show above others is that the writing team approach the script process with care and intelligence . As mentioned before , all four members of the League have a sound mind when it comes to judging the longevity of their creations , and when it 's time to call it quits in respect to certain characters . This awareness has also meant The League of Gentlemen undergoes a bold evolution , not usually seen in a show of this nature . The narrative driven , and far darker third series is a brave step away from the more sketch based first two series ' and this bold move by the League really pays off . With the third series , there 's less of an urgency for them to please an audience , and like the Christmas special , they pursue individual stories with a clear narrative , unlike the more sketch-based previous series ' that ( succesfully ) binded together various sets of sketches into a series ' long story arc . The third series is both a refreshing change of pace of style , as well as a real treat for fans who 've already seen the first two . Despite some polarized opinion on the third series , any real fan of the League will appreciate what the third series has to offer , as well as really enjoy the more character based episodes , that only delve deeper into fan favorite 's , but pair up and inter-wine characters that might not have crossed paths previously . It might take a little trying to get into the change in style , but it 's definitely worth it , and in my opinion , the third series is the best and also provides a firm conclusion to the series . The show 's not without it 's drawbacks , and very occasionally certain characters and set pieces appear somewhat out of place , but for the most part , the genius writing , dark nature of the show and the host of brilliant characters ( that are often all too close to real life ) make for a real treat and prove what comedy should be about and puts much of the more recent , catch phrase driven and often desperate attempts at comedy to shame  
  What do you get if you cross The Matrix with The Truman Show ? I 'm sure you 've all seen The Matrix by now . The creators of The Matrix say that it is ' anime inspired ' . Just from watching the trailer to this classic , you can see where they took the plot from . The film is sort of set in 1980s Japan , and it really shows . The costumes , music and words ( in the recent English Language version by AD Vision ) are all like they 've been directly lifted from the era . I believe it was made in that time also , but due to certain plot points , this doesn't date the film ! As you probably guessed by my referencing to The Matrix , the world isn't real . It 's not really the 1980 's . In fact , it 's something more like the 2480 's . After a nuclear war , the Earth ( or " Biosphere Prime " ) ' s ecosystem was destroyed . The survivors we 're forced to escape into space , where the conflict continued . Once the planets ( or " Biospheres " ) were all abandoned , people began to live in MegaZones - cities inside of spaceships , where , via hypnotism techniques and Truman Show-esque illusion , they were made to believe they we 're back on earth , in the most peaceful time in recent memory .. The 1980s . When young Shogo obtains a mysterious advanced looking motorcycle , it leads him to find out more than he 's supposed to know .. The Garland ( a bike which becomes a mech ) , a weapon from the 2400 's , aids Shogo in his escape from the pursuing military . As more and more is discovered about the MegaZone , the war comes closer to home , and due to conflicts between the military and the computer , the war comes to the MegaZone too .. I apologise if those points are seen as spoilers , but the plot is outlined basically that way on the synopsis . Emotions run high in this movie , moreso than The Matrix . You really do believe the war is going on , and Shogo really does become quite scarred by what he 's discovering . What starts off as an uber-happy cool 80 's flick becomes a tragic tale of war and unreality . These characters are real people , not the cardboard cutouts we saw flipping around in bullet-time in The Matrix . There really is the sense of the suffering people can go through after being caught up in such a conspiracy , and a war . It may just choke you up towards the end .. I know it did me . Animation is pretty impressive for it 's day , and the picture quality on the ADVision DVD is unbelievable for it 's age . The artwork style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime , very cultural . Be prepared for quite a lot of violence and blood , there 's also an erotic sex scene . The ending can be seen as a ' there can be no ending ' , similar to the Matrix , or , supposedly can be followed by the sequel , which I haven't yet had the pleasure of watching . I have to say that this is one of the best animes I 've seen , in fact , one of the best movies I 've seen , and considered by many to be one of the greatest animes of all time . I must recommend the ADVision DVD , as their take on the English Language is incredible , and does the movie justice , and can be purchased with an artbox for holding the two sequels when they are released , which will have the same vocal cast . All in all , MegaZone 23 is an incredible movie , and deserves to be held highly , and should be an essential in any anime fan 's collection . Heck , even my mother enjoyed it .  
  This film is a bit reminiscent of the German film , THE NEVERENDING STORY because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero . However , due to far superior modern technology , puppets and CGI are used to make an amazingly realistic looking world-one that will blow your socks off due to its realism and scope . I enjoyed this film , but boy was it a chore at first ! Unfortunately , for most Westerners , this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd . However , give it a chance . Don't think or try to understand everything you see-just allow the story to unfold and you will most likely enjoy the film . In many ways , this is exactly the sort of advice I 'd give to adults who watch Miyazaki 's SPIRITED AWAY because it is very similar and features tons of Yokai ( Japanese mythical spirits ) . The big differences between the two is that THE GREAT YOKAI WAR is live-action and SPIRITED AWAY is much more child-friendly . While I do think THE GREAT YOKAI WAR was intended mostly as a kids ' movie , in the USA , most parents would not want to show this to younger kids because it 's so violent , scary and features some adult behaviors . So who is the audience in the West ? Well , older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films with non-Western themes and composition . This is a rather narrow audience , indeed ! While you are watching , look for all the strange little touches . In fact , you could watch the film dozens of times and notice different tiny things each time . A few of the funny references I liked were the comment about Gamera , the scene that came with the comment " KIDS : Don't Try This At Home " as well as the use of Kirin beer to allow a person to actually see the Yokai ( hmm , .. perhaps that scene should have also contained this warning ) ! By the way , director Takashi Miike is a hard one to pin down stylistically , other than to say that none of his stories I 've seen have seemed " normal " . Some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and I hated them ( especially AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER ) whereas some of them are magical and among the best films I 've ever seen ( THE HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS ) . One thing for sure , it 's hard to watch one of his films and not have a strong reaction one way or the other .  
  Pegg has had a few hits in the past few years , starting with " Shaun Of The Dead " in 2004 , movie on to " Hot Fuzz 2007 " , early 2008 he came out with " Run Fat Boy Run " and now comes this , " How To Lose Friends And Alienate People " which is in many ways one of my favourite comedy 's of the year . The film is about Sidney Yound , a man who writes a failing magazine who makes fun of celebrity 's mostly because he is not one of them . Anyway , one of the most successful magazine owners ( Played By Jeff Bridges ) invites him ( Out of nostalgia ) to work at his magazine . Sidney is of course excited and moves to America , there he meets a girl currently writing a book , and hilarity ensues . This film is great and I hope more come out like it in the near future . Pegg has once again given people everywhere another good film and I cant wait to the see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy " Paul " . I Rate this film 81 % .  
  Yes , Giorgio , is a feel good movie . A little romance , great music , beautiful scenery , comedy , ( a great food fight ) , and a little taste of bittersweet are the ingredients of Yes , Giorgio . Any movie buff would enjoy this film . Those who require massive special effects , should look elsewhere . Most of us need a little escape now and then , and how better to do this , than with a feast for the eyes , ears , and heart ? A must see !  
  Theodore Rex is possibly the greatest cinematic experience of all time , and is certainly a milestone in human culture , civilization and artistic expression ! In this compelling intellectual masterpiece , Jonathan R . Betuel aligns himself with the great film makers of the 20th century , such as Francis Ford Copola , Martin Scorcese , Orson Welles and Roman Polanski . The special effects are nothing less than breathtaking , and make any work by Spielberg look trite and elementary . At the time of it 's release , Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the bar of film-making to levels never anticipated by film makers . The concept of making not just a motion picture featuring a dinosaur , but adapting an action packed , thrilling detective novel , co-staring a " talking " dinosaur with a post-modern name such as " Theodore " , and an existential female police officer changed humanity as we know it . The world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty . Watching Theodore Rex is much akin to looking into the face of God and hearing Him say " you are my most beloved creation . " This is one of the few films that is simply TO DIE FOR !  
  Once a year " comes " a movie like that and makes things easy for you . You don't have make an effort to think it is good , it 's just is . You enjoy it while you watch it , and you take it home with you . I can't say it is totally flawless , but it 's near . Acting - great , story - interesting and with elements of suspense . It 's a small family story , pretty much predictable , but it 's not the secret itself that matters . it is the way the it takes the blind girl to reach it . I was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship ( the blind girl and her cousin ) . The only thing I didn't like that much is the actress that played the mother , she was too tough and without necessity . Keren  
  I thought the film could be a bit more complex , in a psychological sense perhaps , but the action and voice acting were top notch . The animation was heavy CG in many scenes , but very good ones at that . This is one of the Batman Returns / Forever type films , which include romances and the conflicts of Wayne and motives for dating . 007 fans would love this , and so would the females , great theme song ! Wayne was portrayed very well in this film , and the Penquin was back to his true form , no mutant genes in him this time ! I liked the fact Robin wasn't used too much , Tim Drake was just a good computer nerd , somewhat of an Indigo child or mind of the future . The supporting cast was made up of some soap opera stars , decent talents and the characters were drawn to look like the voice actors too . Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this film . I rate this below Phantasm , Return of the Joker , and Batman vs . Dracula , but liked the smarter script better than I enjoyed Subzero . 7/10  
  This movie is awesome on so many levels .. and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on . Just remember this : When you 're watching Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies .. be they good or bad .. THIS is the formula that they are using . THIS is what makes zombie movies so great . And what makes it BETTER than great is the story behind the movie . A simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know . All in all , it doesn't linger . There 's never a point where you think to yourself " c'mon , get on with it " .. it moves quick and corners nicely . This is the sporty , little Italian number of zombie flicks . So awful , it 's wonderful ! If your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek .. rent it , buy it , love it . As a great trivia note : If you 're watching it on DVD , you 'll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen , underneath the musical score .. Well .. that 's because that music was lifted straight from the trailer .. which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop .  
  * May contain spoilers * * May contain spoilers * In the age of Shrek ( the movie ) & Pixar ( the studio ) , this is a much more traditional animation film . It put together some characters that normally wouldn't be seen together ( not to mentioned , try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father ) . They begin as enemies and end as best friend . If this sound like a Disney film , it is ( only made through 20th Century Fox ) . The trailer to the movie was one of the best I 've seen in ages , but the movie doesn't live to the expectation the trailer set . The problem lie with the fact that the makers of the film didn't made up their mind who is the target audience of the film . Yes , there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but the film is mostly aimed at children . The parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min . their children 's attention is focused on something else than them . The backgrounds are excellent and the voice are good but this is nothing more the a nice film . Children will love this film , adults will only like it .  
  " Ice Age " is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by Blue Sky Studios and released in 2002 as the company 's first . We are introduced to the main characters : a squirrel named Scrat ( voiced by Chris Wedge , AND PLEASE NOTE : the sound of Scrat 's screams is the sound of Tom 's screams from the " Tom and Jerry " cartoons ) , a woolly mammoth named Manny ( voiced by Ray Romano of " Everybody Loves Raymond " ) , a sloth named Sid ( voiced by John Leguizamo of " Titan A . E . " ) , and a saber toothed tiger named Diego ( voiced by Denis Leary of Pixar 's " A Bug 's Life " ) . The movie opens with Scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that , he caused an avalanche . We then see a herd going south for the coming Ice Age ( except for Manny , who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him ) . Sid comes out of his cave yawning , and saw that his family abandoned him . He then pays toll with some aardvarks . Unfortunately , he gets pursued by Sylvia ( voiced by Kirsten Johnston of " 3rd Rock from the Sun " ) , a female orange sloth , who wants Sid to go migrating with her . Sid eventually teams up with Manny , and they became friends . Meanwhile , nearby a human tribe , Soto ( voiced by Goran Visnjic ) , an evil saber toothed tiger , wants revenge against the tribe 's leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son , Roshan , away from him . In the morning , he , Diego , and Soto 's henchmen , Lenny ( voiced by Alan Tudyk ) , Oscar ( voiced by Diedrich Bader ) , and Zeke ( voiced by Jack Black ) attacked the tribe , but the leader 's wife escaped with Roshan and gave him to Manny and Sid to look after . Eventually , Diego joins them , and went on a journey to return Roshan back to his tribe , who are also looking for him as well . Relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out , okay ? Besides Manny , Sid , Diego , Scrat , Sylvia , and Roshan , the supporting characters in there including a pack of wolves that Roshan 's tribe are using , and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named Jennifer ( voiced by Jane Krakowski ) , and a skinny female yellow sloth named Rachel ( voiced by Lorri Bagley ) , to whom Sid shows them Roshan as they relax in a tar pit . Incidentally , the two rhinos , Carl ( voiced by Cedric The Entertainer of PDI 's " Madagascar " ) , and Frank ( voiced by Stephen Root of Pixar 's " Finding Nemo " ) , who go after Sid for ruining their meal and confront Manny on a cliff , are simple minor characters . Same went for the dodos , who are using melons as their food supply . The gags in this movie are very funny . For instance , Manny talks through his trunk saying , " I 'M NOT GOING ! " When Jennifer and Rachel are out of the tar pit , Sid asks Jennifer " What do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens ? " Jennifer then responds to him , " What do you say if you go jump into the TAR PIT ! ? " Rachel also then kicks Sid in the waist . Sylvia sees Diego holding Sid by the neck with his teeth , then she asks Sid if he 's holding his breath , tells Diego to eat him , and promptly walks off . Since " Ice Age " is not only a success , but it has 2 sequels : the first one was " Ice Age : The Meltdown " , which was released in 2006 , and the other was " Ice Age : Dawn of the Dinosaurs " , which is going to be releasing next year . I can hardly die waiting to see what " Ice Age : Dawn of the Dinosaurs " will be like .  
  This film was made in 1943 when i think Judy was at her peak ( looks wise ) . In her previous film For Me and My Gal people often say that she looks emaciated . Well in this film she looks perfect . She is beautiful and shows that she has a flair for comedy . I think this film is hilarious , especially at the beginning when she is trying to arrange an audition with John Thornway . One of the funniest scene 's in my opinion is Judy 's rendition of Lady Macbeth and when John is looking for her at the party to give her a spanking ( Lol ) . One criticism i do have is that there is a hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love . I mean one minute he despises her and the next they are going out on a date then the next time they meet after that date they are in love . Another point i didn't like was on opening night . If i were Lily i would be furious with John but she isn't .. it just doesn't make sense . But all in all i would have to give this film a 10 because it is just wonderful and almost perfect .  
  This movie was okay , but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are " born that way , " especially when a woman can exit out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman . It almost seems as if Kate 's gender preferences turned on and off like a switch , making this film seem a little simplistic . Also , as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda , it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval over the gay lifestyle were labeled as " bigots . " And there was no happy medium . It was either Kate 's friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her . This is not typical of interactions between gay and non-gay relatives and friends . It is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play . It is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning the choices they make . Sadly , the movie showed none of these types of interactions . For a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance , it struck me as very intolerant movie ! Then at the end , Kate apparently decides after all these years she wants to be with Mac and everything is hunky dory - is that what being gay is really all about ? Come on !  
  This Hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale . A young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy . They spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence . However , after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence . However , out of no where , when they are on a luxury cruise , the ship sinks and they lose everything-and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life ! What an odd , silly and preachy film ! Personally , I 'd like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable ! The production values are relatively poor compared to later productions-a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting .  
  Where 's Michael Caine when you need him ? I 've seen most of the many seasons of MST3K , but this rare pre-1st season flick ( episdoe K-20 ) is easily one of the worst movies ever made . Three " stars " , Lee Majors , Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith , struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever , delivering lines which must have been written by a secret Dick Cheney-style workgroup composed of Exxon and GM lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research . Looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness , possibly on Super 8 . Makes Logan 's Run look like the cinematic Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare . I can't imagine watching it without the commentary of Crow and Servo since it 's unwatchable even with it . Clearly what 's needed in Hollywood is some sort of 401K which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care . With its " rights to pollute and drive " theme , by the end , I 'm half expecting to see a Charlton Heston cameo where he delivers his " cold dead hands " speech . Lee , I could have forgiven you for this in 1989 , but 1981 ?  
  " American Nightmare " is officially tied , in my opinion , with " It 's Pat ! " for the WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME . Seven friends ( oddly resembling the K-Mart version of the cast of " Friends " ) gather in a coffee shop to listen to American Nightmare , a pirate radio show . It 's hosted by a guy with a beard . That 's the most exciting aspect of his show . Chandler , Monica , Joey , and .. oh wait , I mean , Wayne , Jessie , and the rest of the bad one-liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded DJ . Unbeknownst to them , a crazed nurse / serial killer is listening .. Crazy Nurse then proceeds to torture Ross and Rachel and .. wait , sorry again .. by making their fears come to life . These fears include such stunners as " voodoo " and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures . No . Really . This movie was , in a word , rotten . Crazy Nurse 's killing spree lacks motivation , there 's nothing to make the viewer " jump , " the ending blows , and-again-voodoo ? If you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones , rent " American Nightmare " with them . If you care for your loved ones-even a little bit-go to your local Blockbuster , rent all of the copies of " American Nightmare " and hide them in your freezer .  
  It has its merit 's ; Morvern Callar is both the merits and the disappointments . She 's so enigmatic , so original . Is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that 's making her so distant and un-relatable ? Or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary ? Personally I 'd call her dysfunctional . Morvern is completely detaching herself . Disposing of her boyfriend , not thinking of informing family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral , she selfishly splashes out on a trip to Spain . She 's seems so devoid of anything relatively human bar greed . The only element that enables the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her . Although by the end her friend is dumped and Morvern has nothing that ties her down to humanity . She may as well have killed herself . Despite managing to make Spain look as gloomy and bland as the UK the director 's shots were superb , the lighting and color made the film visually stunning . It 's really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest . It 's little over 90 minutes but feels a lot longer . They manage to make Morvern seem interesting to grab your attention but do nothing with her only alienate her from you more to the point where you don't care about the characters or the film .  
  I can't believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny . Shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty , disgust and stupidity , ' There 's Something About Mary ' leaves little reason to stay until the end . Sure , Cameron Diaz is very pretty , but that is never going to be enough to save a movie . Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot , and is obviously very talented , but the movie is a loser . Not once were any of the scenes believable . The shots were badly timed and poorly framed . The Farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs . I check IMDB to see what they are working on just so I know what to avoid . 2/10 ; the bonus is from the one time I smiled . It 's not like I 'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion . My wife hated it , too . The next day we saw ' Rush Hour ' and laughed ourselves silly . This movie just stunk .  
  I think the show had a pretty good concept to work with . But the execution was poor . The script is poor and acting is bad . There were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way , like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard . The show can't be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably . I should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of Muslim community to some extent . Till now second season is worse than the first one . I had my hopes high regarding this show , but I was kind of disappointed . Still I appreciate CBC for putting up such concept in front of the viewers . Anyway I wish best of luck for the future .  
  Wow , here it finally is ; the action " movie " without action . In a real low-budget setting ( don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times ) of a future Seattle we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood . There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors ' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies , mainly " Matrix " without having the money to do it right . Yes , we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs ( 45 secs approx . ) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody 's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then . And , yes , we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere , as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes . Believe me , it is as bad as it possibly can get . In fact , it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously , but perhaps I can make some of you not rent it and save your money .  
  How did Mike Hammer live - in a penthouse with a GOLF BAG stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube TV and a snazzy fireplace ? Nah , he 'd knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered Camels on the couch or floor of his fly-specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown LA flop house , wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face , that 's how . Spillane wrote trash paperbacks , for sure , but how do you make it worse ? Give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any Film Noir titled crap will sell at the box office , add some over-the-hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw-up the story-line by some retard , drugged out screen writer , that 's how !  
  I have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the Wrinkle in Time Chronicles . My dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading A Winkle in Time , and would think , what an amazing movie this would make . Sadly enough that screenwriter failed , changing characters , throwing in lame humor , and all out destroying the plot . I know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie . But why can't you stay true to the book ? Why must you change the way characters think and act ? For those of you who have not read the book , pick it up , find a soft couch , and let your imagination run wild .  
  I 'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there 's almost no plot , anyway . I 've seen several reviewers call ISOYG an ' anti-rape ' film or even a feminist statement , and I just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims . First of all , what do we see on the cover of this movie ? That 's right : a shapely woman 's behind . Whether it was Zarchi 's attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and I absolutely don't believe it was - is entirely beside the point . The film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic ( everything but actual penetration is shown ) that NO ONE but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it . The rape ( s ) in the film is uncomfortable , brutal and hard to watch . There 's something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light , but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes , none . There was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed ( mere moments before he 's murdered ) so the scene isn't at all engaging on an emotional level . Really , it 's just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies ISOYG is associated with on IMDb ( Caligula , Cannibal Ferox , etc . ) that it attracts only the exploitation crowd . Finally , a few reviewers have commended Zarchi 's so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack . But considering how inept everything else in the film is ( acting , script , etc . ) I suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their thing . I 'm not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of ISOYG . I 'm all for exploitation / horror and love video nasties . In fact , I 'm giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films . However , it 's also poorly made and after the rape occurs , just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho-hum , mostly gore-less murders and wait for the credits to roll . This is probably worth watching once if you 're a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but I 'm telling you , the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation .  
  I 'd like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot ( ! ) for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest , crappiest movie I 've ever seen ! I have no idea what 's wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here ( imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings ) .. the only thing I can imagine is that people must 've voted during one or more conditions : 1 . While being shitfaced / stoned out of their minds 2 . They 've received hard cash for the votes 3 . Under gunpoint I can't believe I wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie .  
  I am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie " rocked " . It is pure CG over-acted CRAP ! Don't send an Assassin , it 's much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored , aggressive , venomous Snakes on a Plane ! The only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to . It is not " so bad it 's good " It 's so bad I 'd rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again . I honestly thought was going to be a COMEDY like AIRPLANE ! A spoof ! Was I wrong . It 's that whole " It sucks , get it ! " Or Samuel A . Jackson yells " Snakes on the Plane ! thing . Well I 'm sorry , I don't get it . It looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like Triple X and Die Hard . If you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought William Hung 's CD , still live in their mommies basement , and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn , then rush to the theater and ask for one ( since I doubt you have a girlfriend ) ticket for Snakes on a stupid-butt Plane . To hell with movies like Full metal Jacket , Pulp Fiction , True Romance , 12 Monkeys , Clerks , etc . There 's no irony in watching good movies . The true decline of the western civilization . Calling this a cult film is an Insult to true Cult classics like Repo man , or even Orgazmo . I 've said enough here .  
  I thought that the nadir of horror film making had been reached with " Book of Shadows " , I was wrong . This film makes that look like " The Magnficiant Ambersons " compared to this piece of shameless , unexpurgated fecal matter that has the audacity to call itself a movie . I 'd write more but I 'm still to angry that I was idiot enough to spend £3 renting it , bobbins . And were these people English ? and where is the forest > I have lived in the UK two thirds of my life and as far as I know there are no dark uncharted woodlands in the midlands . The whole bally thing looked like a national trust conifer plantation . Those angels looked like anorexic pornstars ( turned most of them were , did my research ) . I did however like the bit when Judd got ripped in pieces . P.S I love and admire Tom Savini but HE CANNOT ACT  
  Booted out of heaven , a gang of horny naked female angels ( with big plastic fangs ) have taken up residence in a spooky forest where they feed upon any hapless souls who should wander by . It 's not long before a group of friends on a road trip are falling victim to the bloodthirsty babes An independent low budget horror made in the UK , Forest of the Damned takes an interesting premise and flushes it down the pan with some of the worst acting , effects and direction I have seen in a long time . Director Johannes Roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera  the scenes in the delapidated house are fairly tense and there are some deftly handled ' shock ' moments - but for the most part the film is technically amateurish . Throw in some truly awful performances from horror icons Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson , and you have one real bad movie on your hands . Some fun may be derived from the film 's sheer shoddiness , and there is loads of female nudity for the guys to savour , but most will find this a chore to sit through .  
  Forest of the Damned starts out as five young friends , brother & sister Emilio ( Richard Cambridge ) & Ally ( Sophie Holland ) along with Judd ( Daniel Maclagan ) , Molly ( Nicole Petty ) & Andrew ( David Hood ) , set off on a week long holiday ' in the middle of nowhere ' , their words not mine . Anyway , before they know it they 're deep in a forest & Emilio clumsily runs over a woman ( Frances Da Costa ) , along with a badly injured person to add to their problems the van they 're travelling in won't start & they can't get any signals on their mobile phones . They need to find help quickly so Molly & Judd wander off in the hope of finding a house , as time goes by & darkness begins to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone & that there is something nasty lurking in the woods .. This English production was written & directed by Johannes Roberts & having looked over several other comments & reviews both here on the IMDb & across the internet Forest of the Damned seems to divide opinion with some liking it & other 's not , personally it didn't do much for at all . The script is credited on screen to Roberts but here on the IMDb it lists Joseph London with ' additional screenplay material ' whatever that means , the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 ) with your basic stranded faceless teenage victims being bumped off but uses the interesting concept of fallen angels who roam the forest & kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction . Then there 's Stephen , played by the ever fantastic Tom Savini , who is never given any sort of justification for what he does . Is he there to get victims for the angels ? If so why did he kill Andrew by bashing his head in ? The story is very loose , it never felt like a proper film . The character 's are poor , the dialogue not much better & the lack of any significant story makes it hard to get into it or care about anything that 's going on . Having said that it moves along at a reasonable pace & there are a couple of decent scenes here . Director Johannes doesn't do anything special , it 's not a particularly stylish or flash film to look at . There 's a few decent horror scenes & the Tom Savini character is great whenever he 's on screen ( although why didn't he hear Judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with Molly ? ) & it 's a shame when he gets killed off . There are a couple of decent gore scenes here , someone has their head bashed in , there 's a decapitation , someone gets shotgun blasted , someone throat is bitten out , someones lips are bitten off & someone is ripped in half . There is also a fair amount of full frontal female nudity , not that it helps much . Technically Forest of the Damned is OK , it 's reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eye-catching . This was shot in England & Wales & it 's quite odd to see an English setting for a very American themed backwards horror . The acting is generally pretty poor save for Savini who deserves to be in better than this . Horror author Shaun Hutson has an embarrassing cameo at the end & proves he should stick to writing rather than acting . Forest of the Damned was a pretty poor horror film , it seems to have fans out there so maybe I 'm missing something but it 's not a film I have much fondness for . Apart from one or two decent moments there 's not much here to recommend .  
  From the start this film was awful ! Why was it that bad ? If it isn't the naked women , not only in need of a decent plastic surgeon but also the expertise of a dentist followed by a free hand out of Colgate whitening ! Then it 's the ' crazy ' old guy at the gas station , who isn't so much crazy , but more " I 'm not sure how to act a great deal so I will stare straight ahead and look as stupid as I can while pretending to shout in robotic tones about something in the woods " ! Then back to these naked nymphs in need of a cure for gingivitis .. apparently , without touching you .. and this is according to the opening scene .. they can cause a nasty looking red rash on your neck , which I assumed to be a chunk of flesh missing but just looks as though it could do with some TCP to clear it right up . Then you have Sophie Holland who plays Ally , I have never seen such baad acting , she is more of a " me me me , if I 'm not having fun no-one else is , and I don't wanna do this so I won't , and I 'm the meanest cow on the planet , I 'm sarcastic , petty and if I don't get things my way I will sulk ! " , kind of person .. reminds me more of a 6 yr old girl 's attitude . I don't think it 's even worth mentioning the dire camera angles that remind me of Blair Witch , or how low-budget the film actually was that when Judd was hacking at the ' locked ' door it was in fact open before he reached to unlock it from the other side ! This film is completely laughable ! If it were a spoof then it would have been successful .. only just though , but , as a horror film is was just plain wrong ! I can't even being to describe everything that went t ! ts up in this movie I would run out of room ! Although it was funny to watch Andrew drip raspberry juice in his ear every time he opened his mouth while Tom Savini 's character was completely blind to the two hiding under the table directly in his line of vision ! It was even funnier when these two thought they could escape on a god damn tractor , which as we all know is thee number one hated vehicle to get stuck behind since its so god damn slow ! So is it any wonder they don't get away with it ? And how many people do you know that can slice open their wrist and then run around for hours as if nothing ever happened ! No pain , no weakening from blood loss , nothing ! ? But the silliest part is when all of a sudden ( and i mean that literally ) it 's one YEAR later and Molly is still wandering the woods after having escaped the nymphs , and then lo and behold , Shaun Hutson picks her up .. of course not without a line to promote his books ! ( altho admittedly he is one of my fav authors ) but suddenly , and with absolutely no hint of an xplanation as to how and why .. she 's evil herself and lures Hutson to his death , then we cut to the crazy dude from the beginning suddenly wandering round the woods with a petrol can , even after his ' dazzling ' performance on why no-one should ever venture there for whatever reason .. cue the nymphs stupidly slappin each other around a bit for fun while Crazy pours petrol everywhere .. and here endeth the film .. finally ! My conclusion .. if you hadn't already guessed by now .. absolute rubbish ! There was no proper thought went into it at all , whoever was aiming the camera needed firing .. and come to think of it so did 99 % of the cast ! If the right director , actors , and budget got behind this it could have been decent . But , once again , low-budget English horror films but the rest of the genre , the country , and the English film-making industry to shame ! ( And I 'm English so I 'm allowed to say that ) ! In fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first 15-20 mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area . All I kept thinking throughout this was " Jesus Christ in heaven why oh why did you allow someone to make this , its absolute cow 's testicles ! " But I can't turn a film off after I 've started watching it unfortunately . I had to watch From Dusk Til Dawn afterwards just to remind myself that Tom Savini does have it in him to act well ! If there was an option for 0/10 then believe me I woulda chose that , cuz this film isn't even worth the one point I did give it ! But this is just my opinion , watch it and decide for yourself .  
  For the first forty minutes , Empire really shapes itself up : it appears to be a strong , confident , and relatively unknown gangster flick . At the time I didn't know why , I thought it was good - but now I do . One of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful . I don't mind films with psychos and things , to prove a point - take Jackie Brown , for example - but they 're all so terribly shallow in this , but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment . You literally feel a knot pull in your stomach . Another major problem is the protagonist . He is smug , arrogant , yet - ironically enough - not that bad . He doesn't seem tight enough to be a drug-dealing woman killer . The fact is , at the end of the day , this film is completely pretentious . Not slick , not clever , just dull , and meaningless - this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs . * out of * ( 1 out of 5 )  
  1st watched 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir-Walter Lang ) : Disappointing musical from a character development standpoint , in my opinion , from this much-heralded Rodgers and Hammerstein piece . There a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal , at times , of the King of Siam by Yul Brynner - but the movie doesn't really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings . I can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we don't fully understand the character 's and their situations . I know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing , but even this part didn't stand out a lot for me . The basic storyline is about an English woman coming to Siam to teach the children about upscale European things . We find out later that the King is actually the biggest pupil . There is a side forbidden romance between the King 's newest wife , played by Rita Moreno ( a latino as an Arab-come on ! ) and a former lover that causes some complications but nothing really mesmerizing added though . Deborah Kerr , as the main female character Annie - is OK but not that convincing either . The King learns some things because of her presence and then the movie fades away as he does . This is really a miniscule story with some songs and dancing but not that great of an experience for a viewer really .  
  ' I don't understand . None of this makes any sense ! ' , exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of Death Smiles at Murder . Having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie , I know exactly how he feels . The story , by the film 's director Aristide Massacessi ( good old Joe D'amato using his real name for a change ) , is a clumsy mix of the supernatural , murder / mystery , and pretentious arty rubbish , the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy 70s garbage such as Jess Franco 's more bizarre efforts , but which had me struggling to remain conscious . Opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister ( with whom he had been having an incestuous affair , before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor ) , Death Smiles at Murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman ( played by Ewa Aulin , who stars in the equally strange ' Death Laid an Egg ' ) is seen alive and kicking , the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of Walter and Eva von Ravensbrück . After being invited to stay and recuperate in their home , where she is tended to by creepy Dr . Sturges ( Klaus Kinski in a throwaway role ) , the comely lass begins love affairs with both Mr . and Mrs . Ravensbrück ( meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin ' ) . ' So far , so good ' , I thought to myself at this point , ' we 've had hunchbacks , incest , some blood and guts , and gratuitous female nudity'all ingredients of a great trashy Euro-horror ; what follows , however , is a lame attempt by Massacessi to combine giallo style killings , ghostly goings on , and even elements from Edgar Allan Poe 's ' The Black Cat ' , to tell a very silly , utterly bewildering , and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave . This film seems to have quite few admirers here on IMDb , but given the choice , I would much rather watch one of the director 's sleazier movies from later in his career ; I guess incomprehensible , meandering , surreal 70s Gothic horror just ain't my thing ! 2.5 out of 10 ( purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness ) , rounded up to 3 for IMDb .  
  Early , heavy , war-time propaganda short urging people to be careful with their spending practices , in effort to prevent any runaway inflation . Using scare , guilt and patriotic jingoistic rhetoric , which was normal for the time , the government was concern that the sudden war-time production and therefore wage increase and subsequent spending practices if not checked could cause serious problems during and after the war . It truly is a window into the past , historically and culturally .  
  This movie was absolutly awful . I can't think of one thing good about it . The plot holes were so huge you could drive a Hummer through them . The acting was soo stuningly bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed , and that is saying alot ! And dialogue , What dialogue ? To think that I was a fan of the first one ( I use that comment loosely , its more like a guilty pleasure , than anything else ) . This movie had Goldberg in it for crying out loud ! Nothing good can come of this movie . What makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you can't even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of ! This has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time . 2/10 because it is soo hard for me to give a 1 .  
  Strange how less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat , uninspiring drivel . If a story is as personal as this supposedly was to Sally Potter , wouldn't you expect a little passion to show through in her performance ? Her acting was completely detached and I felt no chemistry between Sally and Pablo and the tango scenes , which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance , were instead awkward and painful to watch . Obviously , revealing such a personal story on film can be daunting , and as such Sally Potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own sheepishness .  
  Dire . Just dire . The script is contrived , the acting painful , and the story just drags along . It is , without a doubt , a celebration of Sally Potter and little else . This wouldn't be so bad , but she 's the director , writer and star of the film , and so is just self-glorification . I found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters , and the ending came not a moment too soon . It has two redeeming features . First is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely , particularly in Paris , and look rather good in black and white . Secondly , whether you 're a fan of tango or not , the music is by and large , excellent ( except where Sally starts singing ) . Watch this film at your own risk , or if you need an unintentional laugh . I am sure it appeals to someone . Statistically , it has to .  
  .. but a lousy film . As Maltin says this was Christopher Lee 's attempt to make a serious horror film . Well , it is serious .. TOO serious ! The plot is silly and slow ( something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality ) .. the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again . I actually dozed off a few times ! The film is soo dull ! The cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of Peter Cushing and Lee .. but this was probably a labor of love for both ( they often complained about horror movies being too violent .. well , this has NO violence ! ) . Avoid at all costs .. unless you have insomnia .. this will put you to sleep !  
  " Three Daring Daughters " is a sickly sweet , rose-colored look at divorce , remarriage , and single-parent living . Obviously , social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted , takes a cruise , and then dates and marries a band conductor . Even when the " its just a movie " phrase excuses the script from addressing real-life problems , ' Daughters ' suffers from too many incoherent high-note songs , children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader Hose Iturbi playing himself . Isn't it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married ? Admittedly , this movie was released in the nineteen forties . Only a love for old style Hollywood romance and comedy could make ' Daughters ' a tolerable film .  
  An ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting , if only you could bring yourself to care . This " twisting and turning " I speak of refers not to the story ( which contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole ) but to the director 's inability to keep the characters ' faces even remotely centered in the frame . On the other hand , Angie Harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear . The only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it . When you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an all-star cast , you might be inclined to think something stinks . And indeed , it does .  
  Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to Italy , tired of the Hollywood glamor treatment . First it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in STROMBOLI , an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress . And now it 's EUROPA 51 , another tedious exercise in soggy sentiment . Nor does the story do much for Alexander KNOX , in another thankless role as her long-suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son . At least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than STROMBOLI . Bergman is still attractive here , but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman . She 's never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son , despite attempts by a kindly male friend . " Sometimes I think I 'm going out of my mind , " she tells her husband . A portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace , but it does give us a sense of where the story is going . Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome , but being a social worker with poor children doesn't improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worse . The film 's overall effect is that it 's not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like Bergman . The film loses pace midway through the story as Bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that she 's two-timing him . The story goes downhill from there after she nurses a street-walker through her terminal illness . The final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylum . Ingrid suffers nobly through it all ( over-compensating for the loss of her son ) but it 's no use . Not one of her best flicks , to put it mildly . Trivia note : If she wanted neo-realism with mental illness , she might have been better off accepting the lead in THE SNAKE PIT when it was offered to her by director Anatole Litvak ! It would have done more for her career than EUROPA 51 . Summing up : Another bleak indiscretion of Rossellini and Bergman .  
  Del - " You are the dumbest smart person I 've ever met . " Calvin - " Well , I had a brain , but they lost it in the re-writes . " I think what I find most egregious about this bastardization of Asimov 's work was how the character of Susan Calvin was portrayed . In the books , she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists , able to think her way through a problem . Here she 's just a damsel in distress , waiting to be rescued by Wil Smith . There are passing references to Asimov 's Laws of Robotics , but they are an afterthought to the CGI and action scenes . Smith is likable , as he is in most of his films , but honestly , the story isn't that good . YOu figure it out long before these genius characters do .  
  First of all , I am not a huge fan of contemporary Turkish cinema , which is because , the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline . This movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos , as the director and marketing ads imply . In my mere opinion , the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale ( in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country ) Cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what I meant . However , the acting is near perfect . In fact , most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what Altioklar lacked ; talent ! All members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job , even the less experienced ones . ( Like Janset ) At least , Altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation , just because he knows well how to choose the cast . Other than that , he is just a media monkey , who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent . Come on , art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked / half naked women . And just because media boasts off , no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema . Just close your ears and o something real artistic , I am waiting eagerly to applause your next work . Hope , this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach . In short ; Pros > Good acting , hot women ( just kidding ! ) : ) Cons > Each and every single thing , other than the cast  
  If you are a fan of really bad movies , and you think there funny , you will the great acting of Shaq . First off putting pro players in movies hardly ever works . Shaq had to of been the worst actor i have ever seen next to Dennis Rodman who also made a few bad movies . Well any way this movie is also bad due to the hideous kid . I would give this a zero but that is impossible .  
  My friend 's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out , so when she brought home The Convent , a horror movie , i couldn't wait to watch it . Given that it 's supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious , I can say that in some weird way , I like this movie . yes , the acting is bad , and yes , it 's the cheapest movie i 've ever seen , but it 's so damn funny ! " WHAT , ARE YOU SMOKING CA-RACK ? ! " i didn't know this movie even was ever released .. i figured it was too bad .. Yeah , so .. overall the movie is pretty bad ( you gotta admit that much at least ) but I promise you , you will get a good laugh out of it . * this movie kinda sucks but it 's good for a laugh .. especially that guy that holds the ' dagger of despair ' .. THE DAGGER OF DESPAAIR !  
  I am a student of film , and have been for several years . And the concept of a cyber , kung-fu , satirical chimpanzee had me wondering , " Is this the film that 's going to break the mold ? " Let 's face it , America has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a simian costar . After such great classics as " Monkey Trouble " and " Dunston Checks In " , I thought that the best ideas were already taken . But then comes " Funky Monkey " . I laughed , I cried , I contemplated suicide . Now I 've read about demon possession in the Bible , but that still doesn't explain why someone would create such a product of evil . First off , having at least a shred of intelligence , I realized that a chimpanzee was in fact an ape , not a monkey at all . However , I was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film . They didn't . Let me sum up this work of art : A company by the name of Z.I.T. has decided to train chimpanzees as soldiers . Why ? I think they mention something about the soldiers working for bananas , but when it would cost about an estimated 13 million dollars of government money to train one chimp , this doesn't seem cost-effective . Well anyways , Z.I.T. brings in a CIA specialist ( Matthew Modine ) to train Clemens ( The Chimp ) . Clemens is everything Z.I.T. hoped for . He can take out an entire shift of guards , who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall , and yet still manage to remind us that we 're watching a kid 's movie . As you may have guessed , Modine finds out that Z.I.T. 's intentions may be evil ( Gasp ! ) and decides to break Clemens out . Being a CIA agent and all , Modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city , rent a guest room , regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime , and using checks to pay for everything . Z.I.T. finds out where Modine is staying , and sends two of their finest to retrieve him . These guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since Martin and Lewis , or was it Turner and Hooch ? It doesn't matter anyways , because in the end , for a heck of a twist ending , the good guys win ! Yay ! Hooray for predictability ! Throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself , a lonely mom who needs a date , and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by Radio Disney and you get " Funky Monkey " . The climax to the movie ? A football game ! Played by thugs , bumblers , a chimp , and the nerd boy . No one seems to care about such substitutions at a high school football game . Funky Monkey never lets up ! It 's edge of your seat entertainment . Some might even call this the " American Beauty " of monkey-filled features . After finishing this epic , I recalled hearing a story about a railroad worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod pierced his temporal lobe . Funky Monkey is a metal rod among movies .  
  This movie is terrible but it has some good effects .  
  * Warning - no plot spoilers ahead , but movie spoilers nonetheless .. * My significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all-star cast . Wow - very , very wrong . This movie is an overdone , overwrought , and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot ! The copyright date on the box said 2005 , yet during the very first flashback sequence I was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s , and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s / early 90s dresses and hairdos . It looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film ! I tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback , and therefore supposed to look old , but it looked WWAAYY more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s .. then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up , and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences ( yet it 's a different , much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks ) . I was completely confused until I saw in the special features the short film included - it was all the flashback sequences , shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie ! It also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up ( and indeed acting the co-worker in the 2005 scenes ) . Thus , this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old , re-cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time . The shell story , shot in 2005 , is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead ( something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60 's to his girl that they would meet on the " fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium - an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005 ? ) These new scenes and plot might have been OK except the awful , overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichéd action that permeates the new movie . Don't bother . There 's a reason why you 've never heard of this movie even though it has a well-known cast - it 's terrible .  
  This bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie . This installment tries to veer away from its prequel to capture some new blood out of the joke , but it takes a wrong turn and journeys nowhere interesting or funny . There 's almost a half-hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert ( and lots of people watching on " free TV " - since when does that happen ? ) Surely the script writer could have done something more creative ; look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a converging them at the science presentation . Not in this film , which pretty much ended the Bill & Ted franchise . The joke was over . The Grim Reaper is tossed into the mix , for whatever reason . This infusion , like the whole plot , is done poorly and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement . There 's a ZZ Top impression , hammered in for no reason . There 's lights , smoke , mirrors , noise . But nothing really creative or funny . Skip this bogus thing .  
  Hallam Foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of Oedepus complex afterward . It is something like 95 minutes long but would be better in ten . There 's like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops , and habits in a church tower like Quasimodo ( only he is much less sympathetic ) . There 's a strange love story involved which doesn't have anything to do with anything . She happens to look like his mother , yes so what ? We know he misses his mother , that 's what the first ten minutes were about . They should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a O.K. short film . Now it 's a portrait of a character who doesn't change . He is a guy that stuff happens to . The only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job . There 's this whole Oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character . He paints his face , dresses in women 's clothing and wears a dead Badger on his head . A Badger ! You 've got to see the ending ! He returns to his home with the badger on his head ( and it is shot like a tacky Horror film ) to kill his dad 's new wife ( which he had sex with in the beginning ) . And somehow they thought this wouldn't be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background . I 've got to admit though , I 'm kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose . It feels like this MacKenzie director / guy / whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school . You are so smart ! Thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories ! You really dug ! What a Wallraff ! Okay so now I realized this film is based on some random book , but anyway .. Photowise it is boring . A lot of talking heads . Plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene , you know cold and warm etc .. why ? maybe " Hallam Foe " is both a feature and a test film for color blind people . Or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn't be enough to tell us that he feels lonely , so they increased blue so that we really get it . I 'm not even gonna comment on the cliché indie oh how how how cute drawings they have made in the presentation . And all the " cute " sex stuff going on . This whole film is an independent cliché . But I do recommend it . I laughed more than a few times . Though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine .  
  i think that new york is a big fake , i mean her whole guidelines of this show is stupid . i enjoyed flavor fl av more better , she acts like a slut , and a hoe put together . her mother is out of this world , i think she is the devils daughter . i mean what does she think she is doing these men already have girls and i believe once you have been with her you will be to ashamed to go back to your girl . she is nasty , spoiled and a big fat fake . the show is very interesting to watch , how much money is she getting to do this awful show , and whats up with her mother , i thought her and new york did not get along , but now it seems as though she is just as fake as her crazy daughter . and where is the so called husband , he is no where to be found , i would not to be with them either .  
  The show is average . It doesn't make me laugh particularly . However , I think Courtney really brings it down . She doesn't look natural . She has these three ways to talk , all robotic . She talks quietly ( with no intonation ) , she talks normally ( with no intonation ) , or she does that thing where she starts talking normally , and starts yelling gradually . However , her yelling is like " let 's pretend I 'm yelling because I shouldn't be too loud on the set " . She is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing . It 's annoying . You can't really get her personality , because she doesn't really produce emotion , and doesn't get upset . She has this husband , who 's doing all these stupid things , and there is no reaction from her . Very dry and plain acting .  
  The only reason I elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine . All I can say is , it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film . As far as I could tell , Borgnine was the ONLY actor in it . The other performances were so uniformly terrible , I am amazed a studio would actually pay the " performers " to appear . Couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that I thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled , and you have a perfect cinematic disaster . Obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children , and to its credit , it was better than most of the original programing on the Disney Channel and similar kid-focused networks . But honestly , that is not saying much .  
  In this day and age of incredible special movie effects , this one was a sore disappointment . The actors seemed stiff and uninspired , as was the dialogue . Westerns are not common fare for Hollywood so much these days , but movies like " Silverado " prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one . Considering that , it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing , much less creating such a weak film as this one . If you love and are looking for a good western , keep looking !  
  Another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story . Within 15 minutes , the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines , so there is absolutely no mystery , which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense . The only half-way competent actor is killed 10 minutes into the film , so we 're left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things . Low budget films can't afford expensive special effects , so the CGI portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive , but were at least a valid attempt . The creature suit is terrible , as seen when it falls to the sidewalk , and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes , which aren't even the red color shown in mirror shots . The dialogue is clumsy and uninspired , with some lines reminiscent of Aliens or Terminator . The last action sequence takes place in a police station , also a rip-off from Terminator , with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the Darkwolf doesn't smash into . In the end , the girl calls the hero " a good Protector " , but he gets both his partners , the original Protector , and at least three other civilians , not to mention a dozen cops , all killed without getting a decent shot off , in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun . But here 's the real clincher for bad writing : They could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes . Instead , they took it into custody ? ! ?  
  We loved School of Rock and Jack Black . We couldn't wait to go and see this movie . It was the only time in my life the movie was so bad I wanted to walk out . My husband hated it too . The only funny parts were in the trailers . My husband and I wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money . The writing was awful . It had every terrible stereotype of Hispanic people who should be utterly offended . The movie wasn't that long but to us it seemed like an eternity . The people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry . I made my husband stay because I was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts , but there weren't . Save you money and your time .  
  This sorry excuse for a film reminded me a great deal of what I heard about " Gigli " , that Ben and Jen flop earlier this Summer . " The Order " was clearly edited to such an unconscionable degree that the scenes , rather than forming a cohesive and provoking film , appeared to be a collection of disconnected sequences that did little to forward any semblance of a unified plot . Now , I 'm a Heath Ledger fan ( " 10 Things I hate About You " , " A Knight 's Tale " and particularly his supporting role in " Monster 's Ball " ) , but my man needs to find himself a better agent . Keep accepting scripts like " The Order " and " Four Feathers " and he 's going to be on the fast track to movie oblivion . Here are the problems I had with the film . Firstly , the Director tried to make up for the inadequacies of his essential plot by introducing two other plot lines that seemingly had little if anything to do with , well , much of anything . Plot skeins involving the American trying to take over the Vatican and the Dark Pope , while mildly interesting , did nothing to reveal to the viewer anything about the main characters . The attempts to tie these threads together were pathetic at best . Secondly , please don't insult the intelligence of the viewer by inserting into the film scenes that are clearly obligatory . We had manufactured angst , manufactured love and most idiotically manufactured sex that seemed like a page right out of " Matrix Reloaded " with skull-numbing techno music . Rather than developing character , these elements seemed like the cheap devices they clearly were , a half-hearted attempt at putting popcorn-chewing adolescents in the seats . Thirdly , and most importantly , this movie seemed to ha ve an intriguing concept . We have scandal , we have religion and we have supernatural forces at play . Why then do we learn almost nothing about anyone 's background ? We learn a little about Alex , but even he gives up the passion of the priesthood to sleep with a woman after two days , a woman who tried to kill him during an exorcism at some point in the past . And Alex is the most developed , if you can call it that , character in the entire film . As the cliche goes nowadays , if you 're going to see one movie this year , make sure it 's not this one . There 's about ten interesting minutes out of the intolerable 101 minute affair . The only thing that saved me was going with a girl who I 'm rather fond of . 1 out of 10 . I 'm disappointed . File this one firmly under - had potential but blew it on over editing and bad directing - . Heath my man , go back to Monster 's Ball-like cameos . They really suit you .  
  Lolita is a rebel and she 's going to share to our wide open eyes some little sex stories , between sci-fi and fantasy .. Well , this Surrender Cinema production is not very good : very bad acting , horrifying music and a story line without any story and any line . BUT , the sex scenes are pretty well done , lot of lesbian scenes , and Jacqueline Lovell , as beautiful as in The Exotic House Of Wax , offer to us a very good final and very hot strip show . For Lovell 's fans only .  
  The major flaw with the film is its uninspired script . It plods back and forth between vignettes of Bettie 's story and re-creations of the Klaw short films . While the Klaw re-creations are well done , it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety . Page Richards , while not an amazing actress , does a decent job overall . And , at times , she does bear a remarkable resemblance to Bettie . Also of note is some faithful attention to detail . Costumes and clothing well done , as is some of the set direction . The sets are generally sparse and feel stage-y , but do feel of the era . It is sometimes surprisingly well lit , and the color palette was clearly thought-out to give the overall look a vibrant , retro feel .  
  .. the first film I had to walk out on . And it was the cast and crew pre-screening ( Not that I was involved , I hasten to add ) . I made it through the first hour , so I reckon I 'm just qualified to comment , but that was my limit . Like other comments here , how did this get through any kind of QA . An accumulation of the very worst in dialogue , the epitome of wooden acting , awful casting , all wrapped together without a plot . Tara Fitzgerald 's casting was bizarre , almost comic . She possesses the worst Russian accent in movie history . As I left the screening , the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema . They obviously couldn't sit through it again either .  
  1st watched 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir - Harold Young ) : The 3rd Universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two as far as the final result from the viewer 's perspective . The story is similar and the results are ho-hum . This time the story 's location is the U.S. as the Egyptian priest 's new follower sends a mummy to our country in hopes he can revive him to kill descendants of those who opened the original tomb . This time the mummy is played by Lon Chaney ( which doesn't make much of a difference because he 's really not asked to do much acting for this character ) . The new priest becomes a morgue-keeper in the town and sends the mummy out to do his dirty deeds after feeding him the tanna leaf juice . Again , a girl gets in the way , as the priest falls for one of the descendent 's fiancé and wants her , yes - to be immortal with him ( haven't we heard this before ? ) . The plan is , of course , thwarted as the townsfolk hunt down the mummy with torches ( similar to the Frankenstein monster ) and the burning of the creature ends the story .. how do they get a sequel ? I guess you 'll find out with the next one in the series ? or not ..  
  and it doesn't help rohmer 's case that a few years later Syberberg came along and made a staggeringly great piece of work on the same subject ( with a little help from Wagner ) . maybe this movie didn't look so paltry when it came out , without the syberberg film to compare it to , which was probably shot on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources . I actually can't recall at the moment whether there are horses in the syberberg film . all I know is , the German version is pure magic , while this one looks like some college production documented on film for archival purposes . the music .. la musique .. isn't even credited here on IMDb .. but someone based it on ' airs from the 12th-14th centuries " or something .. well it isn't a great help to the film . it comes off as inauthentic and cheesy , comme le frommage mon cher ! rohmer is one of those french auteurs who likes his leading men generally quite unattractive , too , and that doesn't help matters . syberberg 's Parsifal was adorable , and can be seen on German television today selling some kind of special bicycle he invented . .. . I shudder to think what watching the syberberg on video is like . I remember that the last time I saw the film in a theater , the print was so bad that the experience was a whopping 5 hour travesty . But even then it would have to surpass what this version has to offer , I 'm afraid . points for earnestness , for chutzpah , but .. this film simply needed beau-coup more bucks . it doesn't look like a medieval manuscript it looks CHEAPO ! BON MARCHE ! oh and yeah , it just ends very arbitrarily with Parsifal going to church and this cheesy passion play being interjected .. blah !  
  A shame that even a talented director , Desplechin , could not muster a decent performance out of a bleakly-talented actress , Phoenix , Esther Kahn lacks the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot . In an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actor 's plight , the performance and presentation is too contrived and poorly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer . In an overly long running time , the redundancy of Esther 's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the storyline into a frail frame of a disastrous display . The content is incoherent and gratuitous as Phoenix struggles to carry out Desplechin 's instruction , just as Esther is supposedly trying to do the same . Never feeling a convincing victory over Esther 's pain , we never feel a victory in Phoenix 's talent .  
  Elizabeth Taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying , untalented self in this film . This was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy . Rock Hudson was OK as Bick Benedict but clearly an actor with more range like William Holden would have been better . James Dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie . The whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long . The actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make-up . Hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously the same age . 0/10 .  
  As a Dane I 'm proud of the handful of good Danish movies that have been produced in recent years . It 's a terrible shame , however , that this surge in quality has led the majority of Danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism . In fact , it has become so bad that I no longer trust any reviews of Danish movies , and as a result I have stopped watching them in theaters . I know it 's wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie , so let me stress that " Villa Paranoia " would be a terrible film under any circumstances . The fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with Danish film . Furthermore , waiting until it came out on DVD was very little help against the unshakable feeling of having wasted time and money . Erik Clausen is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in Copenhagen settings . I particularly enjoyed " De Frigjorte " ( 1993 ) . As an actor he is usually funny , though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies , namely that of a working-class slob who 's down on his luck , partly because he 's a slob but mostly because of society , and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community . This is problem number one in " Villa Paranoia " ; Clausen casts himself as a chicken farmer , which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible . It is much worse , however , that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on . For instance , the movie opens with a very sad attempt at visualizing the near-death experience of the main character with the use of low-budget effects and bad camera work . After that , the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge . This is symptomatic of the whole movie ; there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters , and Clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is : Telling instead of showing . Thus , at one point , you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels , because the script wouldn't allow him to act out his feelings ; and later on , voice-over is abruptly introduced , quite possibly as an afterthought , to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the director 's ineptitude . Fortunately , at this point you 're roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters , let alone the so-called story . The acting , which has frequently been a problem in Clausen 's movies , can be summed up in one sad statement : Søren Westerberg Bentsen , whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on Big Brother , is no worse than several of the heralded actors in the cast . I give this a 2-out-of-10 rating .  
  Medellin is a fabulous place to live , work , and study . I 've been there twice , and never did I hear anything about guerrilla activities , paramilitaries taking tourists hostage , or anything of the sort . There are " invisible police , " but it is * not * a Big Brother system . There are just enough police so that they are visible in everyday life , but they do not hassle someone without good reasons . La Sierra is an interesting documentary in that the youths it depicts in the movie essentially become its characters . The directors of the movie carefully carve out plot lines among the daily actions of the inhabitants of La Sierra , and when a " character " dies , there is genuine pathos . It is difficult to imagine , however , that the three youths are all members of the Bloque Metro , a gang that used to terrorize La Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country . La Sierra is not an accurate depiction of life in Colombia ; there are , of course , things to be wary of such as petty crime , but when one considers pickpocketing happens in " modern " cities such as London , New York , or Tokyo , Colombia doesn't seem that different after all . Colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show to the world that the once war-torn country is now prospering more than ever .  
  Christopher Lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as GIDEON . This movie could have been a classic had Lambert performed as well as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump , or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN , or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SAM . Too bad because the story line is meaningful to us in life , the supporting performances by Charlton Heston , Carroll O'Connor , Shirley Jones , Mike Connors and Shelley Winters were excelent . 3 of 10 .  
  This was one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . Horrible acting , Not funny at all , and well just boring . I can only assume all these 10 out of 10 fav . all time movie comments are actually the actors themselves in disguise . Idk what the runtime on this movie is I 'm sure its listed on this page It certainly felt like an eternity If your looking for a tough challenge , attempt to sit through this awful movie . otherwise Don't waste your time as I did on this one  
  So i had low expectations for this movie to start with , but it failed to meet even those . while there were some funny parts , even one or two laugh out loud parts , this movie fell terribly short of what i would call good . the funniest jokes were unexpected and over very quickly , leaving us sitting there going " WTF just happened ? " in addition , there were a few jokes that just dragged on and on and on . the part where he falls down the mountain had me yawning . also , the editing was really lacking . there were some poor scene transitions , but that seems to be the style nowadays . It made me laugh , but i wouldn't watch it again , and I 'm very glad i waited for it to rent . give it a chance , you might enjoy it , but don't think you are in for anything along the lines of the 40 year old virgin , or Superbad .  
  Without a doubt , this is one of the worst pictures I ever actually paid money to see - the kind of flick you choose out of desperation at the mall cinema during a Christmas holiday when you have missed the start times for anything good but still are dead set on seeing a movie ! And that is exactly how I came to see this stink bomb .. At the distance of the better part of three decades I can still smell the rotting fish that constitute this story line . Unbelievable plot - that a killer whale carries a grudge against an individual not of the sea - is laughable . And that 's about all , except for a completely out-of-place " love theme " that plays over the finish of a film devoid of a love story . At least Charlotte Rampling is lovely ( in a two dimensional role ) but Richard Harris just chews up the scenery . He was no Captain Quint ( Robert Shaw ) and this is no " Jaws " . Mercifully , I have put most of it out of mind and when I run across it on television air casts I move on immediately . " Danger , Will Robinson ! " See the current t . v . commercial showing a husband and wife whale-watching ( " Orca - I love Orca .. " ) - at least it is over in sixty seconds . This flick represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never get back .  
  This movie certainly proves , that also the good Americans can do terribly good propaganda . No questions being asked , no comments being made on power abuse or police terror , when James Stewart , solid and convincing as always , solves all the stories from Dillinger to 5th Column more or less singlehandedly . June Allyson as his regular love interest holds up the family values and E.J. Hoover is executive producer . And children or non guilty bystanders are never harmed , when the professionals execute . Not to speak of civil rights , which are never broken or homes , which are never intruded . And if the FBI service would not be enough , Steward also gives his son 's life for the country in WW II . Perfectly made , if you wouldn't know better ..  
  Tenants Two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty apartment house . They at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to build . This is based upon a Bernard Malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel . Very little of the dialog is natural , its purple and brimming with shades of meaning . Its as if a college English major with a head full of pretensions wrote the script . It 's awful and I found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say , which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom . Snoop Dog on down are fine form , unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premise . I can't really recommend this movie . While not really bad , its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away . I lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end . If you 're interested I 'd try it on cable , but I wouldn't lay out good money to see it .  
  The only thing that prevented this flick from being a total disaster were a couple of interesting stylish touches . ( Moderate Spoiler Alert ) Death by comic is a bit derivative of a scene in Twilight Zone : The Movie , which delivers death by cartoon . Still this was handled nicely , especially watching the ink bleed and the color being sapped out . Additionally , there is one other good scene with a demon motorcycle . Having said that , I was glad I got the DVD cheap at a store going out of business sale , because this was pretty awful . I bought " Soul Survivors " at the same time and both movies were similarly annoying with the constant realizations that you have been watching a dream . However , where " Soul Survivors " has nothing to redeem it , or have it make any sense , this at least had a couple of stylish notes , referred to above . Interestingly , the DVD lets you go to the 8 ' nightmares ' where something actually happens , which is the only way to watch this . The scripting between the creative gore moments is rather unbearable . 3 out of 10 .  
  From everything I 'd read about the movie , I was excited to support a film with a Christian theme . Everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done . Especially the writing ! Without good writing a movie doesn't have a chance . The writer / director said in an interview that he didn't want to give away how the title relates to the story . Believe me , it was NO big surprise . I kept waiting for the teenage / young adult back-story to unfold , but it never did . As someone who has gone through a divorce , I was very disappointed . This movie would have been NO comfort to me when I first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a Christian !  
  First , this film is not a " thriller . " Neither is it " gripping , taut . " It might have been so based on the script , but the direction 's slow pace makes it difficult to get into . The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious . Unfortunately , we only get a sense of * how * ingenious after the picture is over . That leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that don't grab the viewer , and " cunning vixen " scenes that inject a little more overt intelligence . I wish this had been the fast-paced thriller the box promised . It would 've been an outstanding film . Instead , Spike Lee made it plod along through the end .  
  It seems to me that Stephen King 's " Bachman " pen-name was a way for him to put out some of the grimmer , rawer , more mean-spirited stuff that he wanted to write without ' contaminating ' his ' brand name ' . If you look back at the " Bachman Books " ( Running Man , The Long Walk , Roadwork , Thinner ) you notice they have a sealed-in feeling of airlessness and hopelessness about them that is distinct from mainstream King . I realize that we are talking about the guy whose first novel featured a humiliated , blood-covered , emotionally crippled teenage girl slaughtering everyone at her high school prom .. but mainstream King always at have characters and plot elements that leaven the grimness of the proceedings a bit , and mostly have endings that offer at least a glimpse of hope and human feeling . Bachman books are just plain mean and always end badly . ( BTW , " Pet Semetary " could have easily been a Bachman book if King hadn't revealed the alias by then . And " The Dark Half " seems to be at least partially about his " Bachman " persona . ) " Thinner " was the last Bachman book , and man , with its themes of class warfare , revenge , and death by starvation , it is nasty . So it should be no surprise that the movie follows suit . What is a surprise is that the adaptation seems to be filmed at a " TV Movie Of the Week " level of talent instead of something worthy of a theatrical release . ( These days , something like this would probably go directly to DVD or cable ) . The makeup work and the striking motif ( starving to death in the midst of plenty , a metaphor for the overfed , undernourished American middle class if there ever was one ) is all that keeps you watching this misfire . What went wrong ? My first thought is that the director was going for the nasty Bachman vibe , but he also somehow sucked all the interest out of the movie with poor casting choices - the actors here ( with the exception of Joe Monetegna ) simply can't carry the movie . And then he squished the warmth and life out of the rest of the movie with awkward pacing and scene structure . Plus he couldn't leave the plot alone , and his changes don't really help . The script and dialog ought to work , but mostly the movie just lies there . Everything is muffled , dull , airless , and no fun to watch .. with the vivid exception of the spectacle of the main character getting .. thinner , and thinner , and thinner . As other have pointed out , " Thinner " is by no means the worst King movie ever made ( or even the second worst ) . And it does have a dreadful , compelling fascination owing to the theme and the careful makeup work . But first time viewers should approach this one with lowered expectations .  
  You 'll notice that the chemist , who appears in two scenes and gets to speak , is played by Stephen King . " Don't give up your day job " is the standard thing to say , but that 's not fair . King acquits himself reasonably well : he 's no worse than any other member of the cast , and better than most . The story , on the other hand , is pure rubbish . Please , give up your day job . Never have I seen so many dreadful performances - of which the lead actor 's ( the LEAD ACTOR 'S ! ) is probably the worst - gathered together in the one film . Everyone acts hammily , but not in any entertaining way ; they all somehow manage to go over-the-top without expending , or manifesting , energy . I blame screenwriter / director Tom Holland . It can't be that ALL the actors are REALLY this bad . What are the odds against that ? Admittedly , I 've never heard of any of them before , but still , I don't think I could walk into a talent agency and walk out with this many bad performers if I tried : ONE actor , despite my best efforts , would turn out to have talent . So what 's more likely - that Tom Holland rolled a dozen consecutive snake-eyes , or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it poorly ? That would also explain why actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in the script . The more direction an actor got , the worse he performed . ( " You want me to bend over like a hunchback , talk from the back of my throat , show all my teeth , and look bored , all at the same time ? Okay .. " ) This theory is confirmed by the fact that Holland undeniably managed to co-write a lousy script . Several writers here have commented on the fact that Billy Halleck is not a likeable character , but that 's a misleading way of putting it . He 's not a knowable character . All we find out about him before the supernatural stuff starts happening is that he 's fat , and that all he can think about is food . ( " All I can think about is food , " he tells us , helpfully . ) And in the end .. ( Sigh ) I suppose I ought insert a spoiler warning here .. In the end he becomes evil . Why ? I can only shrug . Perhaps he 's under some kind of enchantment . Yeah , that 's probably it . By " evil " perhaps I mean " inexplicable " - it 's not so much badness as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary means-end psychology . Anyway , his actions at the end make no sense , nobody 's actions make much sense , and this is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audience . By the way , here 's my nominee for hammiest line / delivery : " I don't think you 'd like it . IN FACT .. " [ big dramatic pause ] " .. I don't think you 'd like it at all . "  
  You 've heard it said to live every moment as if it 's your last ? Whether it 's your last day or not , I beg you not to waste any part of it watching this ! Nichole Hiltz provides some nice moments of eye candy ( that alas , stays wrapped ) and David DeLuise shows why he should stick to the small screen or dog food commercials . A shallow , unrealistic plot with dreadful dialogue means there is no " Art " in the " Art of Revenge " .  
  After watching this I thought to myself , there are either too few good writers & directors or lots of producers . At any rate , this is a terrible movie . Terrible in a way that it 's not fun , but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver . Makes you shout " this is wrong " at the movie . Immersion is zero . By now most of you are probably used to the terrible errors / weirdness-es in movies that has computers hackers etc . in them . This movie is like that in every aspect . The only good thing about the movie is the little girl Emily , brilliantly played by Eliza Bennett . I hope she becomes big , and make this .. thing at least worth something . Do yourself a favor . Don't watch this . There is not even proper action in it . Total waste of time .  
  I once used Wesley Snipes ' name as a clue to go ahead and watch a new , untried film in which he appears . So now , for the first time , my Snipes-Method of film recommendation has failed . Utterly . I should first have come here to see these reviews . Snipes ought to be ashamed to allow his otherwise earnest efforts to be so wasted in " The Contractor " . One of my worst flick fears has come to bitter fruition . I feared that the shaky , blurry , pseudo-documentary , " unconsidered " directing and editing style ( first brought to my attention by the Paul Greengrass-directed " Bloody Sunday " ) might propagate to other films . Greengass ' sickening style was then brought to nauseatingly new heights in the last two of the Bourne trilogy films . My fear had come to pass . In my opinion , these films are made really bad by these motion-sickness-inducing methods , which mistake blurry swipes for " action-enhancement " . But the " Bourne Franchise , " as Greengrass so loving calls his cash cow , apparently convinced others in Hollywood to go unprofessional in the quest for fast , big bucks . Read my lips , you Hollywood types . Action needs to be clearly photographed and presented , not merely hinted at by poor , lazy cinematographic techniques . And " The Contractor " goes so far as to emulate " The Bourne Ultimatum " in inanely-repeated sound bites , in hopes their juvenile ( apparently-evaluated ) audiences can't sense them . For example , if I hear a cop radio crackling " Yankee-Romeo " one more time , I 'll just scream . The chances are good I won't hear it again : I certainly won't ever view " The Contractor " again . I recommend to those of you who have yet to see " The Contractor " : just be content with the tranquility this lack affords to your life . 2 out of 10 ; I am tempted to lower that to a 1 .  
  I have to say I was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films . I have no idea why but I trusted Sexo , Pudor y Lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non-existent industry . Maybe it was because the soundtrack ( which I listened to before I saw the film ) sounded different from others , maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces ( apart from Demian Bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors ) and supposedly dealed within it 's script with modern social behaviour , maybe because it 's photography I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical . The film turned out to be a major crowd pleaser , and a major letdown . What Serrano actually deals here with is the very old fashioned " battle of the sexes " as in " all men are the same " and " why is it that all women .. ; " blah , blah , blah . Nothing new in it , not even that , it uses so much common ground and clichè that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflexion on the female / male condition . Full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clichès I talked about before ( those always work , always ) and screaming performances ( it is a well acted film in it 's context ) .. and by screaming I mean , literally . The at first more compelling characters played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir turn out to be according to Serrano the more pathetic ones . I completely disagree with Serrano , they shouldn't have been treated that way only to serve as marionettes for his lesson to come through .. he made sure we got HIS message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood . Anyway , it is after all , a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it ( if you accept to be manipulated by it ) .  
  Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 bucks for rental in my life . If nothing catastrophic happens before I die , this will be the biggest regret of my life . Who ever even thought about this movie , or financed deserves a kick between the legs , because that 's where they were thinking when they made this movie . It 's about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic , and writes pretentious drivel that tries to pass off as poetry . He joins his amorous friend in a trip to the coast . Where they meet girls and such . Only the fat guy doesn't get a girl . Skin flicks don't annoy me , I take ' em for face value . But this movie tries to be more than a skin flick . It 's about Fat guy looking for love in some girl , but then meets another bikini silicone girl that enjoys his poetry . He finds his talent for volleyball which gets money for his family and impresses the ladies , only he has his lady anyways . The dialogue is super-horrible for even a C movie . It supports a ton of black stereotypes , no character development , it 's a glorified porno movie , without any porn in it . Never ever watch this movie .  
  When someone remakes a classic movie , the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original . Also , there 's a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences . Well , the 1973 TV version of " Double Indemnity " has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original . The main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all . Fred MacMurray was great as the lecherous , leering insurance agent Walter Neff in the original ; Richard Crenna just seems world-weary and tired . Edward G . Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as MacMurray 's boss Barton Keys ; Lee J . Cobb , a fine actor , appears almost bored with the proceedings . Samantha Eggar is all wrong as the conniving , back-stabbing Phyllis Dietrichson ; while Barbara Stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role , Eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place . Robert Webber , in the old Richard Gaines role as Robinson 's boss Norton , and John Fiedler taking the Porter Hall role as the crucial witness , bring some life to the movie . In particular , Webber recreates the Norton role well in a 1970s context . However , after the movie starts , the whole thing just sort of lies there , without any life or electricity . This is one film that never should have been remade .  
  Notorious for more than a quarter century ( and often banned ) , it 's obscurity was its greatest asset it seems . Hey , it 's often better to be talked about , rather than actually seen when you can't back the " legend " up with substance . The film has played in Los Angeles a couple of times recently , and is available on home video , so that veil is slowly being lifted . While there is still plenty to offend the masses , it is more likely to bore them , than arouse much real passion . Except for a gratuitous and protracted XX sex scene between a pair of horses ( " Nature Documentary " anyone ? ) , there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama . Once the sex and nudity begins , it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation , a loong flashback to an alleged ' beauty and the beast ' encounter , and a naked woman running around the mansion ( nobody , even her supposedly protective Aunt , seems to even think of putting some clothes on her ! ) . On video , I guess you can fast-forward thru the banality , but it 's not really worth the effort . The nudity doesn't go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as Bertolucci 's THE DREAMERS . Try as one might to find some ' moral ' or ' symbolism ' in the carnality , I doubt it 's worthy of anyone 's effort . Unfortunately , for LA BETE , now that you can more easily see the film , the notoriety of something once ' forbidden ' has been lifted . And this beast has been tamed .  
  Oh my God what the hell happened here ? ! I 'm not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this ? The dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in " King Kong vs Godzilla " , Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy . Its about some villain called Dr . Who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as King Kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap Kong . When he does ( thats when Linda Miller gets annoying ) he makes Kong his slave but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes . Then Dr . Who sends the robot after him . Later when I was watching the movie I got a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns started moaning . As I sat through the misery of watching the DVD while it was playing I was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight . The ending has to be a really bad one because they could 've shown Kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again . Don't watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do .. beware of the disappointment you will receive .  
  I 'm a big fan of Troma but I can't figure out why they bought the rights to this movie , It 's so boring I felt like I was watching for 3 hours . Some where on the plot summary it says " but what Satan doesn't know he 's stuck with annoying tourists " Well they didn't seem to bother him in the movie , just me . The only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays Satan , I like bad movie 's but it was just boring .  
  Some illegal so-called asylum seeker comes to Stuttgart and finds that Germans are " racist . " This is just another already-forgotten steaming nugget in a long list of post-WWII anti-German propaganda films , aimed to make Germans feel " bad " for not welcoming each and every degenerate in their country so he can chase German blonds and sell drugs to German teenagers . If you 're looking for good German films in General , see " Der Tunnel , " " Der Untergang , " " Europa Europa , " and " Lola rennt . " But not this . Also , " Das Experiment , " with the same male actor from " Lola rennt . "  
  While it does crack the odd good joke , the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokes . Unlike what an other comment says I don't think this is the best RTE have ever made , its really dry and sarcastic . Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit , there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud . People seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which aren't really that good . Overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre . Its not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens stuff . I find Benny Hill funnier .  
  Anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought to have their head examined . We have the submissive , heroin-addicted , part-time hooker wife with lacerations all over her body , lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive son . Now , she is squirting breast milk all over the kitchen floor , the release so gained somehow akin to Helen Keller placing her hands in running water . We have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter ( she 's upset with him because he came too quickly ) and ends by murdering his female colleague , having sex with her corpse , and then chopping her up . We have the kid who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mom . You see , it 's all circular . Deep , huh ? The only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son 's tormentors . It 's a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be . If that guy who thinks artists ought to be interested in this slop is really serious , no wonder most people think artists are insane . We saw this lousy movie , then put on " Zero Woman , The Accused . " Oh my God , it was a tossup as to which one was worse . What is going on in Japan these days ? Sick , sick , sick .  
  Yes , Marie Dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits running . Dresler is good . Never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen . I watched this for Polly Moran , whom I 've seen elsewhere . Here , Moran is OK - just OK - as Dressler 's shrewish friend / foe . Too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion . The plot is good hearted . Bad guys try to rob the townspeople . Dressler triumphs and all ends well . I do wonder about the central plot mechanism : bonds . This came out during the Depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly . I , however , not of that era , am vaguely familiar with them . They 're like stocks only different , right ? It seems odd to build a story about The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity .  
  VERY dull , obvious , tedious Exorcist rip-off featuring a Doberman with red eyes - that 's the extent of the special effects in this made-for-tv cheapie . Richard Crenna is about as animate as a chew toy . Very 70 's dress & music only add to the torture . Should put you to sleep almost as fast as " The Corpse Vanishes " , or " The Blue Hand " . Practically worthless . MooCow says eaghh what a stinky dog ! : = 8P  
  If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini series , he would have cried . This was complete waste of time and money . I have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be , CBS wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was Ludlum 's work . May be the creator should check out the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good that TV series was . Poor Mira , Blair , Anjelica and Colm , why did they sign to stoop this low ? Horrible !  
  The box for " To Die For " suckered me in - a shirtless hunky guy and the promise of some laughs and sex . There was plenty of Thomas Arklie ( Simon ) , who 's easy on the eyes , but no laughs and little sexiness . The couple , Mark and Simon , have allegedly been together several years , but neither character is interesting enough to care about , so it 's hard to imagine that they care about each other . The fault seems to lie in the script , not the performances ; both actors do the best they can with what they 're given . The ending is sappy and unaffecting ( well , not totally unaffecting ; I felt relief that it was over ) . If you 're looking for a movie about gay relationships and AIDS that 's funny , " Parting Glances " is far better .  
  OK , how 's this for original - this mean , rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children , all of them ungrateful losers , and two creepy servants , provided they spend the week in his spooky old house . What happens that night will surprise only those who haven't seen a movie or television show before . After a string of murders in which the victims look like they 're bleeding restaurant ketchup , we have a painfully obvious twist ending . The cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their paychecks . There are also a few second-tier actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now . As a result , the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of " Matlock . " I will give credit where it 's due - the closing scene is clever and amusing , if you 're still awake .  
  A family of terrible people must remain in a house for a week or else they will lose their inheritance which will go to the servants who will only get their inheritance if they agree to stay on and keep the house in order . People die ( and so will you if you try to sit through this ) If you 've ever had any desire to see bad actors - many with ill fitting dentures-act or attempt to act in a bad horror movie this is your chance . This is just awful . Its so bad I thought Al Adamson , one of the worst directors ever , directed it , but I was wrong . Its so bad I don't want to say anything more about it , not because it isn't polite but because once I start I may not be able to stop . avoid  
  John Boorman 's 1998 The General was hailed as a major comeback , though it 's hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself . One of three films made that year about famed Northern Irish criminal Martin Cahill ( alongside Ordinary Decent Criminal and Vicious Circles ) , it has an abundance of incident and style ( the film was shot in colour but released in b & w Scope in some territories ) but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever . With a main character who threatens witnesses , car bombs doctors , causes a hundred people to lose their jobs , tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a ménage a trios with her sister , it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film . It doesn't get it . Instead , it 's lumbered with what may well be Brendan Gleeson 's worst and most disinterested performance : he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but there 's nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character . On the plus side , this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug , but it 's at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics . There 's a minor section that picks up interest when the IRA whips up a local hate campaign against the ' General ' and his men , painting them as ' anti-social ' drug dealers purely because Cahill won't share his loot from a robbery with them , but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot - something to do with Cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which we 're expected to find lovably cheeky - that it 's just thrown away . Things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart , but by then it 's too late to really care . Adrian Dunbar , Maria Doyle Kennedy and the gorgeous Angeline Ball do good work in adoring supporting roles , but Jon Voight 's hammy Garda beat cop seems to be there more for American sales than moral balance , overcompensating for Gleeson 's comatose non-involvement in what feels like a total misfire . Come back Zardoz , all is forgiven .  
  I can't believe the likes of Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger got involved ins this piece of garbage ! The script is so poorly written and the directing so weak ( both by the same person ) that its hard to find more one-dimension characters in a film . The dialogs are so lame that this so called thriller got laughs out of the few fools that got into the theatre . The setup it 's tricky , inviting you to believe you are going to watch a chilling thriller and suddenly it turns out into the most stupid persecution film . Bassinger 's character is so dumb , that she actually stops to scream to God " Where are you ! " so the people after her can follow , and then takes a leak ! And then she apparently got into the smallest wood in the world , I mean , she runs all over the place and the killers never loose track of her , and this happens in the middle of the night . It really makes me wonder , is that really the best writing people in Hollywood can find that they spend millions producing it .  
  Although nothing can compare to Vampires Vs . Zombies .. in any realm of film making i will attempt to judge this movie . Firstly , the special effects were breath-taking . When there was an explosion on the television screen i thought my entire house was going to explode , and when automatic machine guns were fired i thought the shells were landing on the floor right next to me . Simply stunning my friends . But the scene when the Jack Black sound-a-like is giving the worst monologue i have ever heard i nearly killed myself , but don't worry since he was getting blazed in the movie he can pass his awful acting off on " I must be high " . Seriously , he must have watched himself mindlessly babbling about non-congruent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be " high " to justify his awful acting . Well if you can say that to excuse terrible acting then if you talked to the writers , directors , executive producers , sponsors you will probably get the same response .. seriously . With a production team called " Shock-o-rama " i was shocked i didn't place a sawed-off shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after this shockingly terrible excuse for a movie was played . If you want to see this movie , then you should be murdered Yours Truly , The General  
  .. may seem far fetched .. but there really was a real life story .. of a man who had an affair with a woman , who found out where he and his new wife were staying , and she killed the wife , making it look like a murder rape .. in her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him .. so she quit her job in Wisconsin .. and moved to Minnesota .. last I heard she was in a mental institution , Security Prison .. she was still wearing the " engagement ring . " that she has purchased for herself .. and had told everyone that he had bought it for her . The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin , and the murder happened in Minnesota .. There even was a feature story in " People " magazine .. Spring of 1988 , I want to say on Page 39 . I remember this as I was in college at the time , and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the Security Hospital ..  
  I think it 's time John Rambo move on with his life and try to put Vietnam behind him . This series is getting old and Rambo is no longer a solider but a cold blooded killer . Ever time he turns up on the screen someone dies . Vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly I am tired of Hollywood making it seem like it was . This is not the worst of the films concerning Vietnam , that honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets . In any case John Rambo carrying around a 50 cal Machine Gun taking on what seems to be half of the Viet Cong army plus a good many Russians is an insult to watch . What is worse is Rambos cheesy speech at the end .. Please ! Oh yeah I heard they are making another one ..  
  The ghost of the Vietnam war has haunted the American psyche for thirty years now . If not because of the fact that tens of thousands of American soldiers went MIA in Vietnam , or the manner in which those who returned were treated , then because it was the first war that America could be said to have lost . Many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves , and the original First Blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world , as the saying goes . First Blood Part II , on the other hand , is little more than a fist-pumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore America can be , both in victory and defeat . Stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular Special Forces commando , while Richard Crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient . Where it all comes undone is in the script , which didn't do any better when it was called Missing In Action and starred Chuck Norris . What little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone , as the filmmakers decide to paint a big S on Rambo 's massive chest . The film picks up a little while after the end of First Blood . The film , that is - the novel didn't allow for the possibility of sequels . In this mediocre follow-up , Rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of open-air mine . As he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat , a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with Colonel Trautman , who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission . Rambo , never one to back down from a hard day 's violent work , accepts , and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be Cambodia or Thailand ( I forget which ) . From there , he is commissioned to seek out a camp where American MIAs are supposedly being held , and photograph them . His mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release . Rambo being Rambo , however , has other ideas in spite of their possible political implications . Of course , things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning Rambo 's work have more interest in making sure no American MIAs are found . It is the age-old conspiracy theory , and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an American family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official Vietnam war had been raging for . Of course , with the Jingoism that was inherent in American society during the 1980s , they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the Vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of Russians . Together , the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from Rambo , but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets , arrows , rockets , and destruction . About the only thing missing is the moment when Rambo drinks from a grail-like chalice and declares himself invincible . To be honest , First Blood Part II is a well-photographed , and well-choreographed , action spectacle . The hand-to-hand combat with the larger Russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever . The rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for Americans to pump their fist to . Fortunately , this fad of America über alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as Platoon began doing the rounds . Some of the kills shown here are quite creative , despite all the problems . The Vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy . The Russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous . Only in a 1980s action film would one see a LAW being used from inside a helicopter . Sure , there have been action film clichés rooted in contradictions of fact , but never this ridiculous before . I gave Rambo : First Blood Part II a one out of ten . It is so bad it is ridiculous , and so ridiculous that it is often funny . One doesn't even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are . The only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved . Keep the tongue firmly in the cheek , and it might be watchable .  
  I remember I loved this movie when it came out . I was 12 years old , had a Commodore 64 and loved to play Rambo on it . I was therefore really thrilled when I got to buy this movie really cheap . I put it in my VCR and started up : Man this movie is really bad ! Sylvester Stallone says like 3 words in the entire movie ( except for that awful sentimental speech at the end ) , and has the same expression on his face all the way . And that stupid love thing in the middle , it 's just so amazingly predictable . I just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else .  
  I remember when this piece of trash came out , all the newspapers were squawking about how it had taken Barbra Streisand years to get the film made . Well it couldn't have taken that many years ; the play only opened in 1975 , eight years previously . It made a Broadway star of the great actress Tovah Feldshuh , who probably should have been cast in the film , but NOO .. the Great STAR BARBRA HAD TO DO IT HER WAY . AND WITH MUSIC NO LESS ! This film is a total disaster from start to finish . For one thing , Barbra was FORTY YEARS OLD when she made it and she looked every minute of it . There was no way anyone could possibly swallow her as a young girl yearning to study Torah . And then when she dresses up as a boy it gets campy . I get the impression that Streisand could not bear to be unattractive so she played around with the make-up ; she is prettier as a boy than she is as a girl . And as if that is not bad enough , she gets involved with both her schoolmate Avigdor ( Mandy Patinkin , whose best moment is the shot of his naked rear end ) AND his fiancée ( Amy Irving , who does her usual sleepwalker routine , a bit of schtick the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she is doing ) . Yentl even goes so far as to marry the girl ; I won't even bother to mention the " wedding night " scene . Then there is the music . Nine totally forgettable songs , all sung by Streisand via voice-over ( presumably as a look inside her mind ) , and each one as intrusive and irritating as fingernails on a blackboard . I won't say that Streisand does not show a glimmer of promise as a director here ; some of the visuals are lovely ( Patinkin 's backside especially ) , and she has a good eye for balance . The problem with this movie is that she won't get out of her own way . I did not believe her for one second in the title role ; she should NEVER have added the songs , and on top of that the whole mess goes on for two hours and fifteen minutes . I was sick of the whole sorry mess after forty-five minutes . Awful , awful , awful .  
  I just don't see how a Concorde-New Horizons film directed by Jim Wynorski and featuring the acting talents of Andrew Stevens and a puppet could be bad . It just boggles the mind , doesn't it ? Well , let 's make no mistake about it . " Munchie Strikes Back " is indeed a bad film . Munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries . For reasons not fully explained until the end of the film , he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son . The mom 's problem ( her main problem at least ) is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks .. to the not-so-tiny tune of $ 20,000 . Ouch . She can't come up with the money because she just got fired . OK .. JUST is the key word in that sentence . What the .. ? Was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck ? Maybe it would 've been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it .. ya think ? Munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess .. but there isn't a limit on the number of wishes you can make ! Munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall Munchie was " borrowing " it from . The annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating . A baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the Earth several times . Sadly , those dumb parents watching the game don't think it 's at all strange . Hmm . Anyway , I 'd like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is . You 'll be truly moved by the scene where Leslie-Anne Down , playing the mother , kicks a dog which is yapping at her . Your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer . " Munchie Strikes Back " ' s credits promised another film to follow entitled , I believe , " Munchie Hangs Ten " . To date , the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force . Heh . 1/10  
  Oh , CGI . A blessing when used properly . A sin with it 's used by people who have no idea what their doing . Sadly , that 's not the only thing that 's used poorly in this umpteen Jaws rip-off . Ok , anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things . 1 : I like low-budget horror movies . And 2 : If there is a cute guy in said low-budget movie , I 'll usually point them out . So , let 's just get this out of the way right now . This is one low-budget horror movie I didn't like . The acting , for the most part , is horrible , effects laughable , and the script rivals Battlefield Earth as the worst I 've witnessed this year . As far as the resident cute boy .. Dax Miller ( Bog ) wins that prize hands down . This boy is hot ! And surprisingly , he 's not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butt .. he can actually act ( well , as much as he can in this odious film ) . Now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way , let 's get on with it . In Cliff Notes version , here 's the story ( don't worry , I 'll try not to give anything away ) .. A film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers ( established cute boy and his buddy ) who surf with sharks . Unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island . Croc shows up , mayhem ensues , and people are eaten . Roll end credits . As I said earlier , this film pretty much blows . It started pretty well , but soon devolved into being silly and stupid . A main character becomes lunch ( in a rather humorous way ) , and our remaining heros utter one-liners at the victims expense . Also , if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water , what 's with all the sharks around ? If this thing can eat a 40 foot boat , I don't think a few skimpy sharks would stick around . The FX is some of the worst I have ever had the displeasure to see . The CGI is horrendous , and they 've even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs . Attention , filmmakers . National Geographic . Discovery Store . The Croc Hunter . They know what crocodiles look like . You obviously didn't reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film . And what 's with the pirate / drug pusher gang ? Did you just need another reason to rip off a woman 's top ? It 's funny how we get little sub-genres in the movie world . With Alligator and it 's sequels , Lake Placid , Crocodile , and now Blood Surf , it now looks like " over-sized crocodile / alligator " movies should now get their own category at Blockbuster . Alligator was good . Lake Placid was good . I even thought Tobe Hooper 's Crocodile was good . Blood Surf , sucked . My grade : D-  
  I am watching this movie right now on WTN because that was the channel that the TV was turned to when I turned it on . It is a not very credible and fairly boring story about a minister 's wife ( Alexandra Paul ) falling in lust with a young stud / drifter ( with washboard abs ) played by Corey Sevier . There may or may not be a plot . Corey whips his shirt off a lot and Alexandra swoons . I 'm getting the feeling he 's supposed to be up to no good , and that 's why he 's messing with skinny Alexandra Paul . It 's not really important because as I said he takes his shirt off a lot and I just caught a glimpse of butt cleavage . There 's a lot of sax on the soundtrack , which is just painful .  
  Della Myers ( Kim Basinger ) is an upper-class housewife that lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and her abusive husband Kenneth ( Craig Sheffer ) . Della gives all the attention to the twins , neglecting their house and her appearance and upsetting Kenneth . On the Christmas Eve , she drives to the local mall in the night to buy wrapping paper for the gifts , and she does not find any parking space available . When she sees an old car parked on two spots , she leaves a message to the owner calling him " selfish jerk " . When the mall closes , Della 's car is hold by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks  Chuckie ( Lukas Haas ) , the Afro-American Huey ( Jamie Starr ) , the Chinese-American Vingh ( Leonard Wu ) and the Latin Tomás ( Luis Chávez ) . When the security guard of the mall protects her , he is shot on the head by Chuckie , Della speeds up her car trying to escape from the criminals . However she crashes her truck nearby a forest while chased by the gang . She takes the toolbox and hides in the wood , fighting against the gang to survive . A couple of days ago , I saw the trailer of " While She Was Out " and I was anxious to watch the DVD . Unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie , and I am totally disappointed with this dull and implausible collection of clichés . Della Myers is presented as an insecure and neglectful housewife and inexistent as wife ; the motherhood is her only interest in her concept of family . She is chased by four mean criminals but she defeats them with a toolbox that seems to be the Batman 's utility belt . Therefore , the plot is so absurd that irritates . The gang of criminals is formed by the favorite cliché of American movies , with an Afro-American , a Chinese-American and a Latin together with an American lord to be politically correct . Kim Basinger has a decent acting , but their children are too young for a fifty-five year-old woman . My vote is four . Title ( Brazil ) : " Enquanto Ela Está Fora " ( " While She Was Out " )  
  As many agree , Origin is a beautiful anime artistically . The music , graphics , and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works . However , if you are looking for more than this , than I suggest looking else where . The beauty stops short of its appearance , and when it really comes down to plot and characters , there 's nothing special . Action is slow and minimal and the people are flat , corny at times , and do not act realistically . Not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there .. So , in summary , oh my goodness , I 've never seen an anime as beautiful as this one ; and oh my goodness , it 's like .. poke people don't act like that . It took a GIANT step forward in graphics and music in anime , but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization , and unfortunately , there 's not even that much action to make up for that ..  
  Model Chris McCormack ( Margaux Hemingway ) is brutally raped by a teacher ( Chris Sarandon ) of her sister Kathy ( Mariel Hemingway ) . He is brought to trial but goes totally free . He then rapes Kathy ! Objectionable and sick rape film . This movie was advertised as an important drama dealing with rape . What it is is a badly written and ( for the most part ) badly acted drama . It purports to be sympathetic to the victim of the rape but shoves the scene in our face . To be totally honest however , Hemingway 's acting is so bad in that sequence that it loses any real impact it might have had . The trial scenes were boring and predictable . And the movie just went too far when 15 year old Mariel is raped ( thankfully that wasn't shown ) . I do admit though that it did lead to a great ending when Margaux grabs a gun and shoots Sarandon dead . But seriously-having a young girl raped is just revolting . Acting doesn't help . For instance , Margaux was no actress . She was certainly a beautiful woman ( and an actual model I believe ) but her acting left a lot to be desired . It lessens the film . Mariel was just OK but this was one of her first films . Sarandon does what he can as the rapist . He wasn't bad but the terrible script worked against him . I do remember hearing that at a screening of this back in 1976 some women stood up and cheered when Sarandon was killed so maybe this works for some people . I found this boring , simplistic and REALLY sick . A 1 all the way .  
  Ben Masters , ( Kyd Thomas ) , " Dream Lover " , ' 86 plays a sort of Mike Hammer character , a private eye who does any old job for a buck and never misses out on all the sexy curves of good looking gals . Kyd makes one big mistake when he stops Morgan Fairchild , ( Laura Cassidy / Eva Bomberg ) , " Arizona Summer " , ' 73 from getting beaten up and raped . Kyd takes Laura home to his pad and when he wakes up , she is out on his patio eating his eggs and orange juice and making herself right at home . By the way , Kyd sleep in his bed and Laura slept on the couch for this particular scene . Laura is mixed up with all kinds of hoods and there are some hot scenes between Kyd and Laura . All said and done , this is a lousy picture and I purchased the DVD for only $ 1.50 and I really got ripped OFF !  
  I 'm not going to say that this movie is horrible , because I have seen worse , but it 's not even halfway decent . The plot is very confusing . I couldn't really figure out what was happening and where things were going . When the movie was over , I was left scratching my head . I watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up , but once the credits were over , that was it . I felt like I was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie , with little or no transition between the two . Character development is very shallow . I couldn't figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone . I couldn't tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk , stoned , mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them . This film seems to be based around stereotypes ( to it 's credit , they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band ) , which SHOULD make character development easier , since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child , or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean . Stereotypes are easy to depict , which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters . This film , on the other hand , uses stereotypical characters left and right , but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible . Another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation . I guess that 's OK because so little time was spent developing the characters that I really didn't get a chance to know any of them , so I never really missed any of them . And last but not least was Sadie 's singing . It 's awful . The music backing her up is not prize winner , but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from Sadie 's vocal cords . I swear that there 's one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes . I seriously thought I was going to have to turn it off during this howl-a-thon . As a whole , this movie is confusing . Characters are ill-developed , Georgia 's acting is wooden and stiff , Sadie 's character is yanked from one bad situation to another , with no back story or explanation . The music was unbearable , and I can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain .  
  Some things need to be clarified . The picture of Mark Ferris is not the Mark Ferris who starred in this movie . I know that because he was my dad . Please remove that picture . Also , Mark Ferris was the writer , at least one of them . I have been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again . It has been years and if someone can point me in the direction of obtaining a copy , that would be great . The movie wasn't all that bad , and trying to compare it to todays world of Star Wars and other high tech sci fi 's it futile . If you watch it , just enjoy it for the rediculousness and humor it possesses . Lighten up on being movie snobs and enjoy some less creative and innovated films .  
  Sondra Locke stinks in this film , but then she was an awful ' actress ' anyway . Unfortunately , she drags everyone else ( including then = real life boyfriend Clint Eastwood down the drain with her . But what was Clint Eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one ? One read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer . It 's an exceptionally weak story , basically no story or plot at all . Add in bored , poor acting , even from the normally good Eastwood . There 's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as I was concerned , this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers . Wow ! Could a film BE any more boring ? I think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun . A real stinker . Don't bother with this one .  
  I 've been reading posts here concerning Wonder Woman 's costume for this TV movie . It should be pointed out at the time the movie was made , she wasn't wearing her traditional outfit . The producers were actually sticking to the comic book writer 's conception of WW for the early seventies . As for the movie itself , I have to agree with many of the other posters here . Snoozefest ! I was a kid when it appeared on ABC in 1974 , so I was at the right age to have appreciated a movie about a comic book hero . Yet I was so " engrossed " with the plot , I stopped watching it three quarters into the movie . Of course , I wasn't at the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee ! : - )  
  I went to the movie as a Sneak Preview in Austria . So didn't have an idea what I am going to see . The story is very normal . The movie is very long , I believe it could have cut to 1/2 without causing any problems to the story . Its the type of movie you can see in a boring night which you want to get bored more ! Ashton Kutcher was very good . Kevin Costner is OK . The movie is speaking about the US Coast Guards , how they are trained , their life style and the problems they face . As there aren't much effects in the movie . So if you want to watch it , then no need to waste your money and time going to the Cinema . Would be more effective to watch it at home when it gets on DVDs .  
  I am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film . Thought visually stunning like all of Ang Lee 's work ( each still frame seems worthy of a print ) , I was really disappointed by the film 's disjointed pace . It really was too long . The story is set in Civil War era Missouri , and is about a young man ( Roedel ) who joins the feral forces of the Bushwackers , sort of renegade Confederate sympathizers who conduct geurilla type fighting with the Jayhawkers , their Union counterparts . He and his close friend , Jack Bull Chiles played by Skeet Ulrich , join the group after Chile 's father is shot point-blank and his home is burned , presumably by Jayhawkers . The story follows Roedel 's and Chiles ' raiding adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war , including former slave who fights for the Bushwhackers ( Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright ) , and a war widow played by Jewel . It seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point , it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped . For example , the agitation among Roedel 's group caused by former slave Holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol , and then dropped until later in the movie . A young villian / bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs much angst and violence against him , but , we never know why . Some of the characters never seem to surface ; I think that is because the movie embraces too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history . The historical detail was excellent . I loved looking at the housing , furniture , clothes , etc . , and I thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters , though they stumbled a bit with the dialog . Unless you really enjoy history or are a huge Ang Lee fan , though , take a pass on this one .  
  The central theme in this movie seems to be confusion , as the relationships , setting , acting and social context all lead to the same place : confusion . Even Harvey Keitel appears to be out of his element , and lacks his usual impeccable clarity , direction and intensity . To make matters worse , his character 's name is ' Che ' , and we are only told ( directly , by the narrator ) well into the film that he is not ' that ' Che , just a guy named Che . The family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film , and once defined , the family is divided - the younger generation off to America . So cliché . Other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boy 's family ; however the political stance of the director is murky at best , and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed . So they lost their property ( acquired by gambling profits ) - so what ? Refusing to take a political stand , when making a movie about the Cuban revolution , is an odd and cowardly choice . Not to mention the movie was in English ! Why are all these Cubans speaking English ? No wonder they did not get permission to film in Cuba . And if family life is most important to look at here , it would be great if we could figure out who is who - we are ' introduced ' to them all in the beginning - a cheap way out of making the relationships clear throughout the film ! The acting was mostly shallow , wooden , and unbelievable , timing was off all around . The ' special ' visual effects were confusing and distracting . References to American films - and the black character as Greek chorus - strictly gratuitous , intellectually ostentatious , and consistently out of place . I only watched the whole movie because I was waiting for clarity , or some point to it all . It never happened .  
  I basically picked up this movie because I had seen Kitano Takashi 's brilliant remake of Zatoichi and was in the mood for another updated samurai tale which also starred Asano Tadanobu . These two movies are worlds apart . Zatoichi added humor and depth to its characters and subverted traditional samurai movie clichés . Gojoe goes off the deep end in the other direction . First off , I hate movies that have other characters inform the audience what the main character is like instead of having the character develop over the course of the movie . " You cannot decide whether you are a monk or a warrior " says almost every character in Benkei 's presence , yet this inner turmoil is barely conveyed within the character himself . Instead of character development , we get bloated , boring , gory battle scenes . Asano 's character is undeveloped and even he looks like he is bored and doesn't know what he is doing there . I know that he usually looks distant and cool and that is part of Asano 's appeal , but this movie doesn't serve him . A lot of the camera movement is nauseating . There is a scene that goes on forever in which the camera spins around the main characters until my wife and I felt like vomiting . The ending is ridiculous and rather anti-climatic . Its too bad that really good samurai movies aren't being made in Japan nowadays with this type of budget . The colors , scenery , and costumes were great , but the rest is just a loong waste of time . I would rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth .  
  All I could think of while watching this movie was B-grade slop . Many have spoken about it 's redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events . Yet really , the techniques used ( as many have already mentioned ) were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole . As far as the plot is concerned , it was lacklustre , unimaginative , implausible and convoluted . You can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as I would . Granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action .. looks can only carry a film so far . The action is poor and intermittent : a few punches thrown here and there , and a final gunfight towards the end . Nothing really to write home about . As others have said , ' BAD ' movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are ' bad ' , you revel in that fact . This film , however , is a void . It 's nothing . Furthermore , if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then I would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way . ' Requiem For A Dream ' , ' Trainspotting ' , ' Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ' and ' Candy ' are just a few examples . Though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like ' Go ' ( overall , both serious and funny ) and ' Halfbaked ' . On a final note , the one possibly redeeming line in this movie , delivered by Vinnie Jones was stolen from ' Lock , Stock and Two Smokling Barrels ' . To think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by ' Loaded ' is vile . Overall , I strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by NOT seeing this movie .  
  i saw switching goals .. twice .. and always the same feeling .. you see the Olsen twins make same movie .. they like play different sports and then fall in love to boys .. OK now about the movie .. first off all such little boys and girls don't play on such big goals .. 2 . football does not play on time outs .. 3 . if the game is at its end the referee gives some overtime ( a minute or more ) .. and the finish is so foreseen .. i think that this movie is bad because of the lack of football knowledgement .. if it were done by European producers it would be better .. and also the mane actors aren't the wright choice .. they suffer from lack of authentic .. OK they played some seasons in full house but that doesn't make them big stars .. you have got to show your talent .. and that is what is missing in the Olsen twins  
  A sad , sad sight indeed is The Munster 's Revenge . The Munsters are brought back one last time ( Fred Gywnne received a huge paycheck to come back to the role of Herman Munster ) in this made-for-TV movie about a pair of wax replicas of Grandpa and Herman that are robots " terrorizing " the city as preparation for a robbery of a mummy 's stash at an exhibit . With the police on their heels , the two elderly television icons try to find out who is actually behind the crimes in order to clear their names . We get to see them dress in drag as waitresses ( a minor highpoint in the film ) , grandpa turns into a bat with attached wire a couple times ( one time even flying to Transylvania with Herman somehow invoking his frequent flyer miles I guess ) , and a most annoying relative " the Phantom " constantly sings and breaks glass ad nausium ! What is most sad is hard to pinpoint : is it that Gywnne ( especially ) and Al Lewis look so haggard in every scene and so indifferent to the material . Is it the hokey costumes of the robots that have that school production values look about them . Maybe it is the ridiculous script . Sid Caesar 's crazy , mostly unfunny antics . Or perhaps it is seeing something which brought me joy and fond memories as a child being treated to a super K-Mart fashion makeover . At any even , the result is decidedly disappointing and silly even for Munster standards . As for the rest of the cast , Yvonne De Carlo is adequate in a most vacuous role ( though showing more cleavage than usual for a woman of her years and experience ) . K . C . Martell makes an ever-so-not affable Eddie Munster . Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn . Bob Hastings as the aforementioned Phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd manner . The film has a real cheap feel about it even for a made-for-TV movie .  
  I saw his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival . I am a film student at the Univeristy of Michigan so I know a thing or two about film . And Crispin Glover 's film is outrageous . He basically exploits the mentally challenged . Not only is Shirly Temple the anti-Christ ( which I admit is a little funny ) telling the mentally challenged to kill each other , but there is an obsession with killing snails . Crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are , mentally challenged . PETA and Human Rights should be all over this thing . It 's not ' counter-culture ' as Crispin stated at the Ann Arbor Film Festival , it 's exploitation .  
  The concept of the legal gray area in Love Crimes contributes to about 10 % of the movie 's appeal ; the other 90 % can be attributed to it 's flagrant bad-ness . To say that Sean Young 's performance as a so-called district attorney is wooden is a gross understatement . With her bland suits and superfluous hair gel , Young does a decent job at convincing the audience of her devout hatred for men . Why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just so she can arrest cops who try to pick up on them ? This hatred is also the only reason why she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this crappy movie . Watching Young go from frigid to full-frontal nudity does little to raise interest , but the temper tantrum she throws standing next to a fire by a lake does . Watching her rant and rave about her self-loathing and sexual frustration makes Love Crimes worth the rental fee , but it 's all downhill to and from there . Despite her urge to bring Patrick Bergin 's character to justice , her policing skills completely escape her in the throes of her own tired lust and passion . Patrick Bergin does a decent enough job as a slimy sociopath ; if it worked in Sleeping With the Enemy it sure as hell can work in this . But I can't help but wonder if the noticeable lack of energy Young brings to the film conflicts with his sliminess . I 'm guessing it does and the result is a " thriller " with thrills that are thoroughly bad and yet comedic .  
  The volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters . Thankfully , highly acclaimed director Nelson McCormick has brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time ( rated lower than Side Out and higher than , well , umm ) . However , don't let the cover of this movie decieve you . Kill Shot stars up and coming star Koji as a modern day Sherlock Holmes . Using such high-tech gadgets as a computer that is less powerful than my Gameboy , Koji is able to aid FBI agents in the tracking of a man who has not committed any obvious crime . While there are other actors in the movie , including brief cameos by Denise Richards , a gay negro , and a preposterously ugly and annoying girl , Koji carries this movie on his own . Any fan of movies such as The Matrix or Hackers will definitely love Kill Shot .  
  Let 's see , here are the " highlights " of The Brain Machine : 15 establishing shots of a pool and a house ; 15 establishing shots of a nondescript office building ; 5 countdowns by a bland technician ; 7 close-ups of a menacing guard ; and a myriad of technical babble to show us this is a high-tech experiment . Various posters have commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of 1972 and the release date given on the DVD box of 1977 . That 's an easy one to explain . This dog simply sat on the shelf unreleased for five years , until someone dusted it off , thinking it fit in perfectly with the post-Watergate mood of distrust in government . After seeing The Brain Machine now , my only wonder is that it ever got released at all !  
  There are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent . This was one of those times . I almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to endure .. and I wish I had .. The pace that a man goes from a straight-laced , controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapid . From a graduation celebration to the predictable ending Tristan Price ( Jesse Metcalfe ) man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman , by violence , and by mind altering substances . Of course , the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful April ( Nathalie Kelley ) . But the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs , violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understand . Frankly , besides being able to stare at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena , this film has no redeeming qualities . Save your money , save your time .. do anything else ..  
  I only lasted 15mins before self preservation jerked me out of the empty eyed drooling stupor that this film effortlessly induced and propelled me screaming back to the video shop armed for bear . To say the film was bad would be a missed opportunity to use words interspersed with characters from the top keys on my keyboard ( just to keep these comments clean ) . One to be avoided .  
  I disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the British . The film effectively blames the people of NI as being the cause of their own troubles . It suggests that the 25 year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with Britain 's partition of Ireland and domination of its history i . e . NI was created by Britain in 1921 irrespective of the wishes of the rest of Ireland . The characters are portrayed as hapless fools , even though I despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause - maintaining their artificial privileges over the Catholic community . It is a known fact that British Intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war , no doubt to keep the Catholics at bay and demoralise republicanism . Nineties ' values about ' machismo ' , masculinity etc are transposed on to 1970s Belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique Irish ' psyche ' which leads to violence . The stupid song from the woman in the club - old Ireland of green fields .. blah .. blah .. - is given a symbolic stature , i . e . poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause . Tedious , ahistorical , cheap and nasty trash . O'Sullivan has made a personal statement on a conflict which requires serious political analysis .  
  When I decided to watch THE BARBARIANS , starring those twin bodybuilders , Peter and David Paul , I thought it couldn't be that bad because the film was directed by Ruggero Deodato , who has a reputation for creating sleazy movies but well made sleazy movies . Well , THE BARBARIANS is remarkably trashy action / adventure movie that wants to be another CONAN THE BARBARIAN , and fails at every level . The look of the film is all wrong . Some scenes were well shot but the tone and the schintzy , tacky " disco " look of the clothes and hair people are adorned with just doesn't make any sense whatsoever , even for a low budget flick like this one . Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairdo and costume . He 's supposed to be menacing but he comes across as a buffoon . And it 's funny to see Eva LaRue Callahan , one of the stars of ALL MY CHILDREN , appear in her first movie , walking around in skimpy fur bikini . I 'm sure she wants this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth ! The so-called Barbarian twins are okay as the muscle bound heroes but it 's almost impossible to construct a proper critique of their acting because their roles are , like everything else in this mess , really ill-conceived . The only way the film tries to differentiate one twin from the other is by having one twin wear a loincloth that covers his ass , while the other twin 's loincloth barely covers his muscular butt . I 'm not kidding ! Don't ask me who 's who though . Deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this film . And his desperation is reflected perfectly in this trashy flick . It 's just bad .  
  To call this anything at all would be an insult to everything else . Some expletives might describe it , but still too positively . Normally one ignores this kind of rubbish , but it was so stupid that one can but despair . Would have though that even Americans and commercial TV-stations would have given this piece of s * t a miss . But as the Germans say : Gegen die Dummheit kaempfen die Goetter selbst Vergebens !  
  This was a waste of 75 minutes of my life . The acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous . It revolves around an evil lesbian who gets rich married men to have sex with her , and then blackmails them for money . One of the victims is a candidate for DA , which is causing problems in his relationship with his wife . Another is a plastic surgeon , also married , and the evil lesbian happens to seduce this guys wife too ! Meanwhile , the evil lesbian 's girlfriend doesn't really like her sleeping around . It ends in a happy ending where all is forgiven . The women get naked a lot too , mostly in situations that stretch reality . bad bad bad .  
  It was a decent movie , I actually kind of enjoyed it . But the ending is so abrupt ! There is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends . What happens after the concert ? What happens with her boyfriend ? Does she hook up with Grant ? Does she come beck in the next semester ? And what about Angela ? Obviously Holly 's performance would knock Angela down a few pegs , but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts . There is so much left up in the air and it 's very unsatisfying . I don't know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something , but it is a terrible ending and I think that it really makes the movie a joke . I was very disappointed .  
  OK when I saw the previews for this movie I thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group I was with . Now living in America especially during this election I see some very deceiving things but I have to say these previews were towards the top of list . I don't see how so many people could be scared by this movie . I only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one . The whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me . As for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of I thought they were comical at best . Oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why ? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning . How does that scare someone ? I can make that noise easily . Now don't get me wrong I have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but I didn't even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad .  
  You wouldn't expect a movie like this to be good , and it isn't . It 's a no budget , ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand-held camera .. and it 's hilarious . The actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings . There is no plot to be seen . The little plot I could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families . The gore effects are actually some of the most sickening I 've ever seen . It seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts , and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs . It 's a funny and sickening film , and it 's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie . My rating : BOMB / * . 90 mins .  
  i have to say that this was the worst film of priyadarshan ( releasing alongside much better kyonki which was also his directorial venture ) , it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences . I think priyadarshan is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and David dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers they also went on to loose their audiences . So it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his direction . Give us more of herapheri 's and malamal weekly 's rather than giving duds like garam masala !  
  Why did the histories of Mary and Rhoda have to be so dour ? Divorced women with indifferent daughters . And why very little reference to the original show and characters ? The daughter characters were silly and uninteresting . Why can't there ever be daughters who like their mother 's on TV ? It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis , and Rhoda would return to NYC , but why couldn't Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be guest stars ? It just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters . It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together of course , but it could have been better , much better . Well , there has been a Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion , a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion , hopefully Mary will do better next time if she revisits her old Mary Richards stomping grounds again .  
  This movie was made-for-TV , so taking that into account , I 'm not going to rip into it as hard as I would a feature film . The script is sub-par , but it does succeed in being mildly humorous in spots , whether it means to be or not . The acting is mostly over-the-top , but that is true for many lower-budget movies . The aspect of this movie that I really hated , though , was that 90-95 % of it is shot on film , but in random places , there will be 5-10 seconds where the footage is shot on video . You can tell because there is less contrast , the colors are less vivid , and the footage is clearly 30 frames per second instead of film 's 24 frames per second . I 'm not sure if maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot on film ( I assume this is why , anyway ) , but it is disorienting and really makes the film look shoddier than it had to look . Anyway , I 've definitely seen worse movies , but I definitely wouldn't say that I enjoyed this movie and I can't recommend that anyone see it .  
  What 's with the murky video in the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie ? It 's like someone put muddy water on the camera lens . The violence and nudity might turn some people off but , that , along with the mostly bad acting is what makes a good cult movie I suppose . My favorite line is delivered by Tarquin the Vampire , " Alas , your breed is dumb . " Okay , no one should ever say " alas " in a movie line unless they 're English and living in the 18th century . The acting by the Van Helsing character and bad girl " Rally " isn't bad . I also liked Master Little played by Ron Little . Wicked martial arts ! Don't take it too seriously and you 'll enjoy it .  
  Earlier today I got into an argument on why so many people complain about modern films in which I encountered a curious statement : " the character development in newer movies just isn't nearly as good or interesting as it used to be . " Depending on the film ( s ) in question , this can be attributed to a number of things , sometimes generic special effects and plot-driven Hollywood garbage like War Of The Worlds , but in the case of over-the-top , uninteresting attempts at social commentary and a desperate struggle to put " art " back into cinema , it 's movies like Dog Days that are to blame . I normally have a very high tolerance for movies , no matter how dull or pointless I find them ( ranging from good , long ones like Andrei Rublev and Dogville , to ones I 've considered painful to sit through a la Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West ) . I shut this movie off 45 minutes in , which is 30 minutes more than I actually should have . I wasn't interested in any of the characters whatsoever and found nothing substantial beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism . In an attempt to say something about the dregs of society , this film too easily falls into being self-indulgent , trite , and exploitative in a very sincere sense . Granted , I 've seen many disturbing movies on the same subject , but there are so many better films out there about depressing , pathetic people ( Happiness , Gummo , Kids , Salo , Storytelling , Irreversible ) that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality . Dog Days had none more than an eighth grader 's distaste for society , choosing to ignore any true intelligence about the way people actually are , and instead choosing to be a dull , awful , and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a work of " art . " This isn't a characterization of the unknown or a clever observation into the dregs of society , it 's just boring and nothing worth caring about .  
  This film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the depths of the darkest side of human behaviour . Loosely linking a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravities , perverted sex , greed , violence and intolerance . All the action is played out over a few very hot and sticky days during a heatwave in Vienna and the heat is maybe responsible for some of the anger and hate in the film . For me the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman was about the worst episode , closely followed by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the ' slags ' flat . You will be gripped and I hope horrified by this film . I hated it but I felt compelled to see it through . 1/10 for ' fun ' 8/10 for displaying ' man ' as he sometimes is .  
  This was a horrible film ! I gave it 2 Points , one for Angelina Jolie and a second one for the beautiful Porsche in the beginning .. Other than that the story just plain sucked and cars racing through cities wasn't so new in 1970 . The Happyend was probably what annoyed me the most , seldomly seen anything so constructed !  
  I always felt that a good film should have a plot . This particular film was missing one , and I feel that it would have been more effective with a plot . This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever ; I was anxious for it to finally end . However , I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long ; it felt like four hours . Not only was there no plot but the film also lacked a notable conflict . It 's not the worst movie I 've seen , but I used to say that it was until I saw " The Fast And The Furious " . So , don't think this review of mine is from someone who needs nothing but action . I actually hate most action films out today ; it 's just that this film is all the way on the other side of the spectrum . Not much really happens in this movie . However , the scenery and costumes were nice .  
  How is it possible that a movie this bad can be made . Bad acting . Bad script . Just an embarrassment all around . This is just one bad cliché after another . This movie actually has some big name stars in it . Unfortunately they 're singers and not actors . This movie made hardly any money for a good reason . The appeal of black cowboy movies just isn't there . It 's a shame they didn't have a good story to tell . This movie actually has some big name stars in it .

  I should have known when I looked at the box in the video store and saw Lisa Raye - to me , she 's the female Ernie Hudson A.K.A. " Le Kiss of Death " for * ANY * movie . Its almost * guaranteed * the movie will be bad ( e . g . Congo ) if Hudson is in it ( with the exception of the Ghostbusters films , which were intentionally campy and bad ) . Despite my instincts , and the fact that I just saw Civil Brand , yet another cinematic " tour de force " starring Lisa Raye , I rented it anyway . After all , I ignored my " Hudson instinct " on OZ and ended up watching a very quality series so I figured I 'd give this movie a chance . If you are a lover of bad movies , this is a definite must see ! This has got to be the most unintentionally funny movie I 've seen in a loong time . The plot is fairly straightforward : Racheal 's ( Monica Calhoun ) sister is killed by a band of brigands ( Led by Bobby Brown ! ) and , like many an action movie before this , she straps on her guns ONE LAST TIME and vows to avenge her sisters death . To do this , she reassembles the titular Gang of Roses ( supposedly based on a true story of a female gang ) and they go out and exact revenge and , along the way , there 's some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town . One nice thing I will say about this movie is that from what I could tell , the stars did their own riding and they looked GREAT galloping . The funniest ( albiet unintentionally funny ) scenes ? Look for when they introduce Stacy Dash 's character or when Calhoun 's character rescinds her vow not to strap on her guns ( replete with a clenched fisted cry to the heavens ) or Lil ' Kim 's character joking with Lisa Raye 's character or Stacy Dash 's character being killed or Lil ' Kim 's character convincing Lisa Raye 's character to rejoin the gang or the Asian Chick or Macy Grey 's character talking bout " The debt is paid " , etc . With the exception of Calhoun 's Racheal and Bobby Brown 's Left-Eye , I can't even remember the names of the other characters cuz I was laughing so hard when they were introduced . If the director had gone for parody and broad comedy this would have been a great movie . Unfortunately , he tries to take it seriously seemingly without first taking exposition , sound design ( in his defense , Hip-Hop is notoriously difficult to work into a period piece ) , set design , script writing nor period historical research ( was it me , or were these the cleanest people with the whitest teeth in the old west ? ) seriously . Usually when I see a movie that 's not so good , I ask myself " Could you have done any better ? " This is the first time in a long time where the answer is an unequivocal " YES ! "  
  This film , originally released at Christmas , 1940 , was long thought lost . A very poor copy has resurfaced and made into a CD , now for sale . Don't buy it ! The film is unspeakably terrible . The casting is poor , the script is awful , and the directing is dreadful . Picture Roland Young singing and dancing . And that was the highlight . Perhaps this movie was lost deliberately .  
  Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles , particularly as Shakespeare 's Othello . Critically-lauded George Cukor film has a marvelous pedigree , having been written by the estimable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin . Unfortunately , the witty banter comes off as self-conscious here , and the backstage business is overripe . Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score , and Shelley Winters has a few fine moments a tough waitress ( when theatrical Colman breathlessly addresses her , she asks him , " What are ya ? Some kind of nut ? " ) . Otherwise , this scenario is awfully obvious , surprisingly draggy , and not very funny . * 1/2 from *  
  This movie was almost intolerable to sit through . I can get beyond the fact that it looks like it was shot with a home video camera and that this movie is supposed to span over weeks in time yet the characters do not once change outfits , but the acting broke the 4th wall to pieces for me . I 've seen better acting in a 4th grade play . Aside from that the plot is unrealistic . If the man suspected the guy he would have turned him in . I was also heavily disappointed that all the killings were done with a gun what kind of gore is that . That is not a copycat the Zodiac did not kill using just a gun the authorities would have known it wasn't him . Another thing that really bothered me was that they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4 when that is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders not the name of the disorder . Overall I think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a low budget at least not as low as they had or they could have made sure they had better actors or more gore . Plenty of people have went the low budget route with out having to use horrible actors look at Easy Rider that had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget .  
  A repressed housewife ( an annoying lisping Angie Dickinson , whose body double treats / horrifies us with an extreme closeup of her delicates ) is sexually bored by her husband and decides to branch-out . This directly results in a string of murders that soon involve a high-class prostitute ( Nancy Allen , clearly I am in the wrong business if SHE can bring home $ 600 a night ) and her psychologist ( Michael Caine ) . If you are going to watch De Palma rip off ( excuse me , " pay homage to " ) Hitchcock , watch " Sisters " instead of this . " Dressed to Kill , " while loaded with style and technical skill , is one of the tackiest thrillers I have had the displeasure of sitting through . The plot is absurd and tired . It does feature some surprisingly effective jump scares and nasty graphic murder sequences that should please any horror fan , as long as they can get past the silly story line , that must have been dated even in 1980 .  
  I gave this film 2 stars only because Dominic Monaghan actually put effort through in his acting . Everything else about this film is extremely amateur . Everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed . Not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films . As Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor , placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful . Whomever the " actor " was that played Jack 's best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera . I didn't expect much from such a small film , but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings . Don't waste your time or money on this film ( like I did ) you will be sorely disappointed .  
  I realize it 's not supposed to be BSG and I can handle slow-paced shows if they 're interesting but I find myself completely uninterested and bored with this series . The formula for BSG seemed to be : Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama the formula for Caprica seems to be : Bland Drama + Moderate Scifi Maybe it will get more interesting but as of episode 3 I can barely watch it . In fact , it 's at the bottom of my to-watch list for the week . This is a sad state of affairs . The Syfi channel really destroyed their Friday night lineup . Whatever happened to the glory days of SG1 , Stargate Atlantis , and BSG on Friday nights ? They had a good thing there .  
  Ugh . This is a terrible film , full of disastrous comic relief , no scares , and scary leaps in story and plotline . The only creepy thing here is the leading lady 's hats . Lugosi was on his downhill slide and it shows . I give this a 1 , and this ain't no fun .  
  War , Inc . - Corporations take over war in the future and use a lone assassin Brand Hauser ( John Cusack ) to do their wet-work against rival CEOs . A dark comedy satirizing the military and corporations alike . It was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on . I kept waiting for things to make sense . There 's no reason or method to the madness . It 's considered by Cusack to be the " spiritual successor " to Grosse Point Blank . I . e . , War is more or less a knock-off . We again see Cusack as an assassin protecting * spoiler * the person he 's supposed to kill as he grips with his conscience . To be fair , John Cusack looks kind of credible taking out half a dozen guys with relative ease . The brief fights look good . The rest of the film does not . It 's all quirky often bordering on bizarre . War Inc 's not funny enough to be a parody , and too buoyant for anyone to even think about whatever the film 's message might be , which I suppose might be the heartless ways that corporations , like war factions compete and scheme without a drop of consideration given to how they affect average citizens . Interesting , but the satire just doesn't work because it 's not funny and at its heart the film has no heart . We 're supposed to give a damn about how war affects Cusack 's shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by war . John Cusack gives a decent performance . His character chugs shots of hot sauce and drives the tiniest private plane but quirks are meant to replace character traits . Marisa Tomei is slumming as the romantic sidekick journalist . There really isn't a lot of chemistry between them . Hilary Duff tries a Russian accent and doesn't make a fool of herself . Joan Cusack just screams and whines and wigs out . Blech . Ben Kingsley might have to return the Oscar if he doesn't start doling out a decent performance now and again . Pathetic . It 's not a terrible movie , but in the end you gotta ask " War , what is it good for ? " Absolutely nothing . C-  
  * LIGHT SPOILER ALERT * The story sounds good and if you 've read the novel , then you 're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships . True enough , the script tries to do that , the director tries to do that , but the main cast fails miserably . Maria 's acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever , her most intense moments seem almost comical . Sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera . Her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend . Ioana seems even more tense than Maria and even worse , she doesn't seem natural at all . Maria had the attitude , even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious , but she had it and her character received some credibility . And to make matters worse , we don't have an insight on her : where does she come from , how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship , how did the relationship evolve ? We only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to ' be ' there : it has a content and and end , but no beginning . Just like her partner Maria , she has only once scene that is truly touching , the scene where she dumps Maria 's character Kiki . Tudor is the only person in this movie ( aside from the landlady , great acting there ) who manages to prove some acting talent . He has his character 's attitude and it fits him . Only once or twice he seems to falter ( the scene at his parents ' meal , he tries to be obvious when it wasn't necessary at all ) . I love the story , Tudor Chirila is OK there , the landlady actually acts and Puya delivers his couple of lines with style , but this doesn't save the movie . Too bad , the entire setting had huge potential and the Romanian cinematography could 've used a movie on this theme . Oddly enough , the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no-background no-feeling ( well , Maria 's spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction ) lesbian relationship of Maria and Ioana . I 'm quite sorry for spending money on a ticket , I 'd rather had watched it from the comfort of my room .  
  ' The Vampire Bat ' is definitely of interest , being one of the early genre-setting horror films of the 1930 's , but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praise . The film is set in a European village sometime in the 19th Century , where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals . There is a very similar feel to James Whale 's ' Frankenstein ' and this is compounded by the introduction of Lionel Atwill 's Dr Niemann character , complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancement . The vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red-herring by having suspicion fall on bat-loving village simpleton Herman ( Dwight Frye ) , thus providing the excuse for a torch-wielding mob to go on the rampage - as if they needed one . This is one of a trio of early horror films in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray co-starred ( also ' Doctor X ' and ' The Mystery of the Wax Museum ' ) and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill-advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements . Taken in context though , ' The Vampire Bat ' is still weak and derivative . All we are left with is a poor-quality Frankenstein imitation , with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink Dracula fans . But for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director Frank Strayer was doing the ' Blondie ' films a few years later .  
  Was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama ? This film starts with a light-hearted banter between three women . Fine . It moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man . Fine . There are a few antics between them . Fine . But when the plot thickens and finally becomes black I started to wonder whether I had misinterpreted the first part of the movie . It continues in this vein for a while until , in the end , it tries to go back to the original light-hearted banter . But by now it 's too late . It 's hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing . Truly a lesson ( for British filmmakers anyway ) of how not to make films . Difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work . And the box office proved it to be a real flop , because I 'd never heard of this film until this weekend ( four years after its release ) .  
  I saw this recently and I must say , I was moved by the factual basis of the story . However , " Holly " as a movie did not quite work . I am however , looking forward to watching the documentary which the producers who organised this project had made because I think that would be a much more compelling work than this film . The international cast was composed of B-class actors but their acting was appropriate , and I must give a special mention for the young actress who played Holly . This was her first movie role and she did a very nice job , considering hers is the most challenging part . Ron Livingston was adequate but bland as Patrick , the American whose quest is to " save " Holly , but Chris Penn was good in this , his final role . Unfortunately , despite my mostly favourable opinion of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier , both of these actors were very much forgettable and did not do their best work in this film . I believe in the film 's message and intention , but I have to be fair , so I rate " Holly " 3 stars based on its shortcomings as a movie . But I think the subject matter deserves serious consideration and I am pleased that the people behind this movie have made a documentary as well which I hope will have its debut on BBC and other TV networks .  
  A film so insecure the creaters perhaps hoped to milk an original film noir classic title , " Farewell My Lovely " , thinking the gullible would assume it a remake . The characters are so foul and unappealing that it deserved its cold reception when first released . Time only adds to it its absurdity . Having none of the guile , cinematography , desperation or despair of classic noir it relied instead on a convoluted and senseless crime plot that would have easily resulted in several arrests within hours . As if that weren't enough it threw in an utterly sexless attempt at erotica in which at least one of the participants hadn't bothered to bathe in several days . This only made this mess all the more painful to watch . Find a good classic forties or fifties film noir instead of wasting two hours on this failure .  
  I read some gushing reviews here on IMDb and thought I would give this movie a look . Disappointed . On the plus side the male leads are good , and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince . Seems to be full of its ' own self indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful but falls way short and all in all the picture is an unconvincing mess . It is one of those films classified as a film noir which can be defined as follows : " A film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism , fatalism , menace and cynical characters " . Well that is the story here : 3 losers stumble upon each other with their collective problems that include mental illness , alcoholism , laziness , indebtedness etc and together they conspire to kidnap a child and outwit each other . Would have been a much better movie if the story was confined more to the kidnap instead of the character failings of the kidnappers . I thought the female lead was way out of her depth and came across as an amateur actress . Whilst some good moments , I finished up feeling I had wasted my time . 4/10 .  
  What we have here is a classic case of TOO much patriotism . This is what happens when you live in a small country with very little ( next to none , even ) cinema history . Whenever somebody does come up with a slightly more ambitious film project  other than the usual dramas about struggling farmer families or long feature slapstick movies of local comedians  everybody feels obliged to love it and even responsible to spread favorable reviews across the countries ' borders . This is especially the case when the writer / director of this particular film is already a nation 's sweetheart , because he 's also the founder and lead singer of a popular rock band . " Any Way The Wind Blows " is by no means a bad film , but it 's definitely overrated ( if that is even possible within the boundaries of a small country ) and has absolutely nothing new or even remotely original to offer . This is basically the Flemish version of classic movies such as " Short Cuts " and " Magnolia " and illustrates a mosaic of characters whose daily lives initially appear to be unrelated but eventually come together in the end . The only thing that seems to unite the eight protagonists at first is the city of Antwerp , where they all live and work , but gradually the deeper relationships between them become transparent and near the climax they all gather for a party . The main problem with " Any Way The Wind Blows " , at least according to yours truly , lies with the characters . They really are random , uninteresting and honestly don't experience anything that could be considered out of the ordinary . It was presumably writer / director Tom Barman 's intention to depict the average & regular inhabitant of Antwerp but then , seriously , what is the point ? One of the characters gets fired from his film projectionist job , another one is a failed novelist struggling with a marriage crisis , two siblings recently lost their father and the most " mysterious " one of them all is followed by the wind wherever he goes . There are a couple of more characters regularly walking through the screen , but they 're even less worth mentioning . These people simply drivel on and on about very random topics ( like life in the 80 's , dates and each other 's bowel motions ) and philosophy about matters nobody cares about . Some of the dialogs do evoke mild chuckles , especially the interactions between the two twenty-something guys from Ghent , but still nothing extraordinary or even memorable . The film actually works best as a touristy video to promote the city of Antwerp and as an extended & versatile music documentary . There are several stylish & nifty sightseeing images of Antwerp and there 's always beautiful music playing , whether really loud or subtly in the background . Generally speaking " Any Way The Wind Blows " is a competently made and stylish effort , but too mundane and slightly boring , and I honestly wonder most of its fans would even had bothered to watch if it weren't a Flemish production .  
  It WAS supposed to be the last Freddy movie ( and it was for over 10 years ) - you would think they would have tried to get a good movie done . But they turned out giving us the worst of the series ( and that 's saying a lot ) . The plot made no sense ( I seriously can't remember it ) , all the main characters were idiots ( you REALLY wanted them dead ) and Freddy 's wisecracks were even worse than usual . The only remotely good bit about this was a brief ( and funny ) cameo by Johnny Depp ( the first " Nightmare " movie was his first ) . Also I originally saw it in a theatre were the last section ( reaccounting Freddy 's childhood ) was in 3-D . Well-the 3-D was lousy-faded colors and the image going in and out of focus . Also the three flying skulls which were supposed to be scary ( I think ) had the opposite reaction from my audience . EVERYBODY broke down laughing . Looks even worse on TV in 2-D . Pointless and stupid-very dull also . Skip this one and see " Freddy vs . Jason " again .  
  This movie had a good story , but was brought down because it didn't have enough horror film elements and violence . It was like watching a live action cartoon . It would of been better if this story is what they planned from the start of the first movie so they could of played seeds for where the series was going .  
  Freddy 's Dead : The Final Nightmare , the sixth installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series and once again another bad sequel . I think this is tied up with the last sequel of the Dream Child . I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street series box DVD set for my birthday , so I got to see all the sequels . May I say that I 'm just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels , at least the past two , it just seems like Freddy lost his edge . It 's almost like the writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and they 're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story . This was a sequel that wasn't needed , sorry to Robert Englund , but this was very much below what Freddy Krueger represents . Freddy is back , but he 's got something we don't know about , a daughter . Maggie , she 's not aware that he is her father , but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help . She has to do her best to resist his powers , but it 's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father . Ironic , isn't it ? But Freddy isn't giving up without manipulating her into his ways . Freddy 's Dead : The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3-D , radical , huh ? Note the sarcasm . This is one of the worst sequels , it 's tied up with the fifth sequel of the Nightmare on Elm Street series , I 'd rather watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest . This just had bad acting , stupid editing , and just over all a bad idea for a story . I didn't like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who Freddy Krueger really is , the death master of nightmares , not Father Knows Best . 2/10  
  We actually watched this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time . Maybe we 'd missed something .. nope , what 's missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction . I actually went back to Robbin 's novel to see if I could find the problem , and I discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzy-headed junk . So , the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all , and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there . Absolutely nothing works - not a blessed thing . Some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots . All of the actors look at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks positively mortified - except for Rain Phoenix , who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is . The dialog is one , long , unwavering cringe . Scenes don't make sense from second to second , and the connections between them are nonexistent . And yet , the movie stumbles blindly on , convinced that it is saying something profound . This is too bad to even be funny ; it is simply excruciating . Gus Van Zant has done other good-to-great movies which I encourage you to see , and I 'm happy he survived ( and appears to have learned from ) this mess .  
  The silent one-panel cartoon Henry comes to Fleischer Studios , billed as " The world 's funniest human " in this dull little cartoon . Betty , long past her prime , thanks to the Production Code , is running a pet shop and leaves Henry in charge for far too long - five minutes . A bore .  
  This movie gets both a 6/10 rating from me , as well as a 9/10 . Here is why : As a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd , where action and gore and scares are taken into consideration , this movie WILL bore you . It 's basically a family drama similar to what you 'd see on the Lifetime channel , but put in a horror universe . The story and formula are age-old , retreaded hundreds of times . If you 're looking for any originality in the plot structure or the minimal conflicts , you 'll be disappointed . Take away the zombies and you 'll have something just as melodramatic as A Beautiful Mind , tripping on cheese . This is the 6/10 . However , the basic synopsis and idea is pretty original and over-the-top . It 's literally something you and your friends would joke about when you 're half-drunk . . . but that joke actually got a theatrical release . The idea gets a 9/10 from me . The only reason it isn't perfect is because they could have taken it even further , but they didn't . The mix of both is mixed . I thought it was funny , but as with most all comedies , it wasn't THAT funny . I had my mom and little sister watch it with me and the jokes we made about it were funnier than the jokes scripted . There were moments of utter genius , but there were also moments of pure boredom . I sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of over-the-top risk and original ideas . I just can't say it was perfect , or even near it , because of the lack of originality to the plot . A GREAT family movie . A great movie to watch with a bunch of guys ( or girls ) . A great movie to watch with anyone . . . but if you watch it alone , it will be a bit boring . Other people always make this kind of movie funnier and richer . 4/10  
  R O B O T J O X . Burn the master . Grotesquely horrible . No ending ; no closure . Completely and utterly the worst movie ever made . Replaces " The Adventures of Pluto Nash " as the worst movie of all time . I hate this utterly unacted , unedited , unscripted , undirected , unproduced mess of a thing called " Robot Jox " - and I just found out - THEY MADE A SECOND ONE ! ? ! ? I apologize to Adma Sandler ( Zohar the Beauticin ) and Eddie Murphy ( Pluto Nash ) for hating their movies . This mess of a thing makes those movies only bad - not terrible horrible and grotesque like this thing . This is the only movie for which I have ever said this - REMOVE IT FROM NETFLIX - NOW ! 10,000 out of 10 people found this comment helpful .  
  What ? Is Jamie Foxx supposed to be funny ? Does he really believe he is funny ? Well , it 's funny watching his confidence in being funny . The man has no identity whatsoever .. I mean you can immediately see who his idols are , Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence , because he tries really hard to imitate them in most of his movies . The only problem is that he does it bad , uneven , and what comes out are some parts where he somewhat looks like Denzel , with that macho-s * t attitude and then abruptly goes to being Martin Lawrence , the funny and clumsy-silly comic . There 's no personal touch to all that , I mean he contributes nothing to the personality he tries to sell , and I 'm sure he has nothing to say personally . He really is Mr . Dull-boy in person . I was really hoping Hollywood , and the black community in America would find somebody better to launch into super stardom , like Don Cheadle for example , but perhaps the pathetic Jamie better represents the generation that remixes the old .  
  Drew Barrymore is an actress that has gone through bad periods , not only in her career , but in her personal life too . After being a prodigy child actress she descended into obscurity with mediocre films of low quality . While she has recovered from that dark past , this movie stays as a reminder of Drew Barrymore 's worst days . The movie starts with an interesting premise , very reminiscent to Brian De Palma 's " Raising Cain " ; with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story for a horror / thriller . Barrymore stars as Holly Gooding , a young woman who is trying to make a new life in California after a traumatic event of her past in which apparently her other personality killed her mother . Suddenly , her past returns to haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life willing to ruin her new found peace and her new found love . In the middle of the chaos his new boyfriend , Patrick Highsmith ( George Newbern ) , will try to help Holly to face the demons of her past . Unlike De Palma 's underrated thriller , " Doppelganger " is for the most part a mediocre film that not only never fulfills it 's purpose , it also concludes in one of the worst endings of movie history . While Barrymore is definitely not at her best , she manages to keep her dignity with an above average performance . The rest of the cast however range from mediocre to painfully bad over-the-top performances , although Leslie Hope manages to be among the best of them . The script is full of clichés and De Palma 's influence is quite obvious . While the movie tries to be original by making literary references in almost every line , the dialogs are dull and the wooden acting certainly doesn't do any good . It has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons , and excessive use of special effects . The make-up effects are done by the outstanding KNB and are really among the few good things in the movie . However , the bizarre over-use of the effects in the totally out of context ending decreases the impact of KNB 's work and makes cheesy what in a different movie would be amazing . The fact that this is a B-Movie is no excuse for it 's low quality , as with a better and more coherent script this could had been an interesting movie . Sadly , all we have here is a mediocre film that gets worse every second . Worthy for Barrymore 's beauty . 3/10  
  Here we have a movie which fails in pretty much every way it is possible for a movie to fail . Terrible script , lousy acting , amateurish directing , laughable special effects .. it 's just an utterly awful movie . Not to mention the fact that when you get to the end you 'll realize the whole thing doesn't make a lick of sense . After spending the whole movie wondering what in the world is going on here when things are finally explained you realize the story has been built on a foundation which is ludicrously impossible . In one of those hideous " villain explains the whole movie " sequences we are told that our villain has done something which quite simply can't be done and which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . Oh , and after that we see that there also appears to be some kind of jell-o monster involved . I 'm sure Drew Barrymore would very much like to pretend this movie never happened . If for some ungodly reason you are ever tempted to sit down and watch this movie may I suggest instead taking that time to bang your head against a wall for 104 minutes . That would prove to be a much more pleasurable experience than sitting through this garbage .  
  My 10-year-old daughter , Alexandra , writes : I thought it was very boring , and I thought it was just a repeat of stuff from " 101 Dalmatians . " I couldn't wait for the movie to end . The best part was the credits at the beginning - they were cute and well done . The rest of the film is not worth watching . Thank you .  
  I don't know why , but for some sick reason , I think since I 've been on the Disney sequel binge , I decided to just go ahead and see 102 Dalmations . The first movie that was a remake of the Disney cartoon classic starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil , it seemed like a sure hit , but it was just a bomb . I think the reason why these movies don't work is because 101 Dalmations , the original , was a cartoon , it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults . This was not really that fun because it 's adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings , I understand they 're trying to make sure that it 's appealing to the kids , but it 's ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film . And 102 Dalmations 's story isn't really that good . Cruella De Vil has been in prison for a while , but things change when she is proved that she now loves animals and is a pleasant human being . But her reputation is now damaged as a puppy-napper , but she buys a man 's dog shelter and is all of a sudden is being loved by everyone and it looks like she 's changed . But when she sees her probation officer 's Dalmatians , she goes crazy and starts seeing spots , and she looses it . She 's back for revenge on puppies and is still determined to get that Dalmation coat she 's always wanted . Glenn Close is such an amazing actress , very under rated , but her taking on Cruella De Vil , she 's good , but let 's face it , this movie made the fun villain just more of a silly nut case . Also , as cute as the puppies were , it just works more for the animation , it sounds stupid , but it 's just not as believable without the cartoon and their personalities being in the mix . I wouldn't really recommend 102 Dalmations , it 's alright , but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time , this is just the same thing . 2/10  
  Trying to conceive of something as insipid as THE SENTINEL would be pretty difficult . The problems are many . The result is terrible and loaded with plot holes . Michael Douglas stars as Pete Garrison , a Secret Service agent who " took one " for Reagan during the attempt on his life . Years later we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse Family , mainly as a guard for the First Lady ( Kim Basinger , L.A. CONFIDENTIAL ) . Troubles arise as we see Pete 's close involvement with the First Lady , and a sudden threat against the President himself ( David Rasche , UNITED 93 ) . When Pete fails a polygraph test , he 's singled out as a disgruntled agent by investigator David Breckinridge ( Kiefer Sutherland , 24 TV series ) . As the presidential assassination plot unfolds , Pete finds himself on the run from his own people . His only confidant is the First Lady , and she 's reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for one another ( which is why Pete failed the polygraph in the first place ) . But is Pete really innocent ? Or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the President ? If he is innocent , how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the Secret Service ? The one , big , overwhelming problem with this film is that there 's no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat . Isn't that what the movie 's supposed to be about ? One would think so ! But the audience is never let in on why the assassin ( s ) want to kill the Prez . Hmm . Someone forget to put that in the script somewhere ? And what 's with David Breckinridge 's ( Kiefer 's ) new partner , Jill Marin ( Eva Longoria , CARLITA 'S WAY ) ? Seems that she was put in the film strictly as a piece of a$-candy . What was her purpose again ? Did she do anything other than look nice in tight pants and a low-cut blouse ? There are so many problems with the basic premise of The Sentinel as to be laughable . The action is too easily stymied by the " What the .. ? " responses sure to be uttered by those unfortunate enough to watch the movie .  
  The final pairing of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is basically a complete misfire . The script is weak and has been presented badly . The film just has no life in it . Eddy and MacDonald would have been better off just making a filmed concert for their final pairing . There 's nothing wrong with their singing , its just everything else in this turkey thats overcooked .  
  I 'm sorry but this is just awful . I have told people about this film and some of the bad acting that is in it and they almost don't believe me . There is nothing wrong with the idea , modern day Japanese troops get pulled back in time to the days of Busido warriors and with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything . When the troops first realise something strange is happening does every single person in the back of the transport need to say " Hey my watch has stopped " ? Imagine lines like that being repeated 15 + times before they say anything else and you have the movie 's lack of greatness in a nutshell .  
  Have you ever wondered what would happen if a couple of characters from Beverly Hills 90210 were thrown into a Thai jail ? If so , this is your movie . This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd . That would be ok , but the story was poorly executed . Contrived plot twists , poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound . This slight film did not earn the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being . Potential spoiler and impossibly preposterous plot line-the faux tension filled moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls do not have a room there and is about to kick them out . ( This moment is innappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested at gunpoint ) . Later the same hotel employee is somehow found-and Bangkok is a big city , mind you , Ive been there - and testifies against the girls , as if a couple of free Mai Tais warrant 40 years in prison . C'mon . Rent Another Day in Paradise instead .  
  I cannot believe how popular this show is . I consider myself an avid sci-fi fan . I have read countless sci-fi novels and have enjoyed many sci-fi movies and TV shows . I really wouldn't even consider this true sci-fi . Every episode I have sat through was like a lame , watered down version of a Star Trek episode , minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting . It 's basically a bunch of people standing around in ARMY fatigues , talking about something boring , who occasionally go through the Stargate and end up on a planet that looks just like Earth , with people who look and sound just like Humans ! It seemed extremely low budget . The characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts , and the many attempts at humor fall flat . It reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it , trying to be funny , but he is not . It is just sad . The movie was terrible as well . There is so much you can do with a portal through space , yet every place the ARMY people go is BORING ! This shows no imagination ! I actually thought the TV series " Alien Nation " from a few years back ( based on the movie Alien Nation ) was much better . That show actually had good story lines and decent characters . I wasn't crazy about " Alien Nation " , but compared to this overrated crap , it was great ! Also , unlike the great new " Battlestar Galactica " series , " Stargate " copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely ! They should have at least updated the cheesy " toilet flushing " special effect of whenever somebody goes through the Stargate .  
  Truly bad and easily the worst episode I have ever seen .. ever . They tried to make up for it by giving it the , ' we know we are doing this ' routine . That would have been funny if it weren't for the fact that ' The Simpsons ' had already done it . And it still wouldn't make up for it if they had come up with the idea in the first place . The flashbacks took place as part of the usual character 's ( mainly J.D 's ) fantasies . The flashbacks weren't even of actual events that occurred , just compilations of say , J.D falling over or , i don't know .. Elliott falling over . If I wanted to watch a Scrubs compilation i 'd go on youtube and not waste half an hour of my life . Scrubs has ultimately fallen into the trap that most sit-coms have to , and it disappoints me , they managed to go 5 and a quarter seasons without an episode like this . I was hoping that scrubs wouldn't have to be that kind of sit-com . And just as a passing thought , why the hell was Dr . Cox bald ?  
  As with most of the reviewers , I saw this on Starz ! OnDemand . After watching the preview with my girlfriend , she decided not to watch it from how bad the preview watched . I , on the other hand , thought it looked weird enough to warrant a watching . I mean , the design of Dr . Meso alone warranted at least a brief sweep over this title . After watching it , I can say that while there are some interesting aspects to it ( namely the browsing over the notebooks and trying to figure out the incomprehensible story ) , it 's best to pass over this one . * Major Spoilers Ahead * After making their first video for their as-yet-unfinished CD , the lead singer , Cassidy , kills herself in an attempt to get her boyfriend Neil to notice her . 3 months later , the band is trying to decide if they 're going to finish the album or not . To try and see what Cassidy would have wanted , they go to see an old psychic friend of hers , Dr . Meso , and try to contact her through him . In his card reading , Dr . Meso turns up four straight Death cards for the four remaining band members . Bad times are ahead . ( I just wanted to make a point that later in the film , they do explain that the Death card really just represents change . Kudos to them on that at least . ) Even without the approval of their deceased friend , they decide to go ahead and finish the album . But while in the bathroom , Cassidy 's best-friend , Dora , catches a glimpse of her deceased friend . When another band-mate goes in to check on her , Dora is standing in the dark , requesting his sunglasses . That 's when the killing begins . My main problem with the film from the very get-go is that it seems to be heavy stylized to a fault . Too many warping effects , unnecessary zooms , and a plethora of other cheap effects riddle this film . An incoherent storyline doesn't help anything either . While the narrative hangs together for the first part , once Cassidy is resurrected , everything falls apart . We have jump-cuts between Cassidy and Dr . Meso ( who mysteriously was able to get into a locked building ) , which show they are connected in some way or another . However , within a few minutes of that revelation , we find that Cassidy really is an independent being from Meso . She then turns on the guy who had been helping her revenge and he scurries away in a way that calls to mind Jack Nicholson as The Joker . But not in a good way . From this point on , the whereabouts of Cassidy are shown , but there are strange lapses as character moves from place to place almost out of sequence . One scene we see Cassidy standing at a desk , when a character enters in the next , she 's nowhere to be found . As he moves behind the desk , we see her at the end of a hallway . Then in another room grabbing the keys ( which Neil already has ) , then back again . Not to mention that from one moment to the next , Cassidy 's mood seems to go a complete 180 without a catalyst to it . One moment , she wants to kill everyone ( although she 's only wounded 90 % of the characters ) - the next she 's apologizing to everyone and walks out the door to die again . Sound confusing ? That 's because it is . It 's a jumbled mess that I 'm sure the writer couldn't even figure out . As for the performances , most are particularly wooden . Some though are interesting , but overall this isn't a piece that would be known for it 's acting . The story is the driving force behind this piece .  
  Expectations were somewhat high for me when I went to see this movie , after all I thought Steve Carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like Anchorman , The 40 Year-Old Virgin , and Little Miss Sunshine . Boy , was I wrong . I 'll start with what is right with this movie : at certain points Steve Carell is allowed to be Steve Carell . There are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh , and it 's due almost entirely to him being given the wiggle-room to do his thing . He 's an undoubtedly talented individual , and it 's a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be , in my opinion , a total train-wreck . With that out of the way , I 'll discuss what went horrifyingly wrong . The film begins with Dan Burns , a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column . He prepares his girls for a family reunion , where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other . The family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie . No family behaves like this . It 's almost as if they 've been transported from Pleasantville or Leave it to Beaver . They are a caricature of what we think a family is when we 're 7 . It reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating . Touch football , crossword puzzle competitions , family bowling , and talent shows ARE NOT HOW ACTUAL PEOPLE BEHAVE . It 's almost sickening . Another big flaw is the woman Carell is supposed to be falling for . Observing her in her first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated . What I imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded . It makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet . I left the theater wondering what I just saw . After thinking further , I don't think it was much .  
  - might contain spoilers .. but believe me , this movie spoils itself from start to finish . I walked into this movie with high expectations . It was my own fault . I had put too much stock in Steve Carell 's record to date . 40 year old virgin .. Little Miss Sunshine .. The Office . And I also made the mistake of coming to IMDb and seeing a 7.5 user rating before going to the movie . It 's always been a very good predictor in the past , but something is definitely off lately . The last time I felt this embarrassed and in this much pain in a movie theater was watching " Blue Steel " in 1990 . This flick fumbled from start to finish . The script was flunky material . Awful writing all around . " Murderer of love " ? " Love is an ability " ? Whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that struck American Beauty 's writer ( s ) .. trying waayy too hard . The entire flick was peppered with Three 's Company'ish moments like the awful and contrived shower scene . Or the pointless / confusing aerobics scene . Or the awful laundry room scene . Right when you think something serious and / or real is about to happen , they toss in one of these terrible moments . And it happens over and over and over again . And what 's with Carell 's character ? The guy meets some lame broad at a book store and is suddenly head over heels in love ? Let 's face it . Their conversation sucked . They both should have said their goodbye 's after a few minutes . Pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune of watching this movie .. Carell 's character is trying to say something which is absolutely random and un-funny ( I think the exact line was " this one time when I was a kid " .. that 's it . seriously ) , but both are laughing so hard that coffee is about to spout out of their noses . The actors themselves looked like they were in pain , wondering why they 're being directed to do what they 're doing . Back to the IMDb thing .. you guys need to figure out a way to keep a movie 's promotional team off this site . I know it 's impossible , but it 's painfully obvious the first 20 or so ratings / reviews were either posted by 12 year olds , or by flunky 's hired by the studio . Check out The Family Stone 's rating .. if that 's a mid 5 , then this absolutely has got to be a 2 .. and that 's pushing it .  
  " Meatball Machine " has got to be one of the most complex ridiculous , awful and over-exaggerated sci-fi horror films that I have ever came across . It is about good against evil and a coming-of-age tale , with the aim of to entertain with bloody , sleazy and humorous context . Because of that the violence isn't particularly gruesome and it doesn't make you squirm , but the gratuitous bloodletting and nudity does run freely . The performances by Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka is the worst i have seen , if that was not enough it is also directed by an unheard of director called Yudai Yamaguchi . This movie just have it all , it is bad to the bone ! , A must see for every b-movie freak ! .. Simply : an enjoying and rare gem .  
  I must say that during my childhood I 'm quite proud of a lot of the movies I 've rented . The exception being Theodore Rex . Talk about the all time swindler movie in any actor 's resume . Could you just imagine what Whoopie 's fired agent must have told her to sign on to this piece of crap " Hey Whoop , you ever seen that show Dinosaurs , yeah well they 're making a movie out of it , and you get to see Germany ! " After that that agent must have referenced Star Wars a lot . This movie was so bad I figured Whoopie must have bought out every copy of this film and had it destroyed . I just wish she could have done the same thing to my memory , because my sister still gives me crap for watching that movie . I mean c'mon , I 'll even admit I watched Mr . Nanny and Kazzam in theaters ( good reasons why I gave up on both Hulk Hogan and Shaq for awhile ) , yet this one sticks out in my mind as the worst of my childhood , and the biggest rental regret of my life , and that was 16 years ago . I 'm 24 now if you want to do the math . Whenever I think of my all-time list of worst movies I don't even mention this one , because like a raped step-child , I try hard to repress that it ever happened . Screw you Whoopie , just be glad people only acknowledge Eddie and Sister Act 2 as your worst you lucky stiff .  
  SHALLOW GRAVE begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in PSYCHO . ( I 'm leaning toward rip off . ) After that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better , almost to the point of being original . Bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story , but the film already surpasses many in the " Yankee comes down South to get killed by a bunch of rednecks " genre because it is actually shot in the South . A group of college girls head to Ft . Lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in Georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road . ( Note to Yankees : stay on the highway when you go to Florida . ) Sue Ellen ( Lisa Stahl ) has to pee so she heads into the woods . When she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff ( Tony March ) strangle his mistress ( Merry Rozelle ) to death . ( Note to Yankees : do not wander off into the woods when in the South ; not because you might witness a murder , but you may run across a marijuana plantation . ) This is the point where the story , not the movie , actually comes close to being good . While Tony March will never have to practice his Oscar speech , his Sheriff Dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do . Tom Law is likable as Deputy Scott and is as authentic a Southern deputy as I 've seen since Walton Goggins ( Deputy Steve Naish ) in HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES . A few scenes in the movie are worth the mention . The girls stop at a BBQ in South Carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out . Sue Ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her . And in the strangest scene , Sheriff Dean makes like he 's about to rape Patty ( Carol Cadby ) and tells her to take off her clothes . Dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he 's about to do . The preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his Bible . His sermon is about how Jezebel is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ . I feel sorry for this preacher 's flock . Jezebel was in the Old Testament a few thousand years before Christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in Heaven .  
  Ignoring ( if possible ) the tediously gratuitous marijuana smoking ( which seems to be mandatory in Australian government-funded films ) the cast of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance . That 's a far as it goes . The rest is simply awful . The plot 's overburdened with " wow " symbolisms which are meant to look good on film but go nowhere . A gross example is the giant peach float , obviously left over from a town parade and donated by the local canning factory . It was just too tempting to waste what was hopefully a free , but nevertheless irrelevant , prop ! The peach is given a cursory , unexplained wash-down at one stage but that 's where it ends . Similarly , the contrived " black spot " road sign where Steph 's parents were killed , is intended to symbolize the eventual escape from her past , but her escape to what ? She 's had a pretty good deal where she was , especially considering her visual disability and the unending , loving patience and care of her understanding young female guardian . The Guinness ' prize for corny melodrama , however , goes to the characterization of Alan . Alan successfully aspires to the noble role of trade union shop steward but " rats " on his fellow workers by becoming a supervisor for a wicked multi-national - hiss ! hiss ! As a supervisor , Alan performs the boss ' villainous dirty work . He implements redundancies until , surprise , surprise , the whole plant is closed and Alan himself is left as a pathetic , unemployed failure . No cliché-free zones here , mate ! Not only this , but Alan also loses the seductive Steph from the most unlikely relationship you 'd encounter . If you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic , don't ask about detail . What 's the significance of the shaving cream on Steph 's seductive leg ? Why doesn't the hotel , where the couple makes love , eventually twig that someone 's gaining illegal entry to one of its grandest bedrooms and , among other pandemoniums , the sheets are regularly soiled - quite spectacularly on one occasion . Summing this movie up in one word : Avoid , Avoid , Avoid .  
  Daraar got off to a pretty good start . The first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next . Other than that , the first half of the movie is a total BORE . All the first half of the movie is about is Rishi Kapoor falling head over heels in love with Juhi Chawla . By the way , don't you think he 's a little old for her ? Things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when Juhi tells us about her previous husband ; and wow what a lunatic is he ! He was an over-protective , neat-freak with a really HOT TEMPER ! He used to beat up poor Juhi for no good reason ! One of the reasons I really don't like this movie is because I can't stand to see Juhi ( my favorite actress ) get so abused . This film in general has WAY too much abuse and bloodshed ; I find it so sickening ! Anyway , all I 'm trying to say is if you 're thinking about renting Daraar , you should put it right back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else !  
  Born Again is a sub-standard episode from season one . It deals with the subject of reincarnation and just doesn't fly . I 've never been big on reincarnation and that could be part of my apathy toward this episode . It does reference the Tooms case which is some nice continuation from the previous episode . But the positives end there . Which is unfortunate because that takes place at the beginning of the episode . I think it 's ludicrous that a dead guy would chose to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl . And he waits until the girl turns eight to start exacting revenge . There 's even a serious lack of witty Mulder & Scully dialogue to keep the episode afloat . If you 're into reincarnation , maybe this episode is up your alley . If you 're not , then at least you can learn what bradycardia is .  
  For die-hard Judy Garland fans only . There are two ( 2 ) numbers that are really good - one where she does a number with an older cleaning lady ( you 've all seen the pics ) , and a pretty good number at the very end . There are a couple of scenes where the lines are funny . But , basically , the script is so bad and the movie so dated that it 's hard not to cringe at the awfulness throughout . But it 's worth the 2.50 to rent the movie - just be prepared to fast-forward it .  
  What do you get when you mix a lump of clichés with a directionless pacing and a group of characters who you don't care about and a failed attempt at creating an appealing visual style and an even bigger lump of clichés and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget ? Why , you get one of the most intolerably unwatchable movies ever made ! I 'm referring , of course , to Domino . Here are some things that people might say during the viewing of this movie : " Ooh , wow , the storyline is told out of sequence , that hasn't been done a billion times before . And much more skillfully than in this movie . " " Wow , look at all of the flashing lights and grainy film texture and elaborate transitions ! The director is trying so hard to make things look arty and to establish a visual style ! It 's just too bad that none of these effects add anything to the movie or make sense with the scenes they 're in , and it 's also too bad that most of them come across as irritating ! " " I 've heard that exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand movies before ! " " I 've seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies before ! " " This one too ! " " Uh , didn't they reveal this ' plot twist ' about half an hour ago ? Was that supposed to be surprising ? " " If this movie is supposed to be showing a ' tough chick ' going around kicking ass .. when why doesn't she do very much of it ? " " I can't believe how unoriginal this dialogue is . " " How long is this thing ? I feel like I 've been watching it for over four hours already . " " I have no idea what just happened , but also , I don't particularly feel motivated to try to figure it out . " " Is this over yet ? " " I want my money back . " " The songs in this soundtrack feel so misused here . " " It 's ironic that all of the cursing they use actually detracts from the impact of each one . " " UGH . " And , finally : " I might have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me . " In summation , this movie is a failure in nearly every aspect . Avoid watching it at all costs . If your house is on fire and this movie is playing in the only room that isn't flammable , you should seriously consider being burned alive instead . ( If I sound bitter , it 's because I just spent over two hours watching this movie and , uh , I didn't enjoy it very much . )  
  Someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date . I have since discredited everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie . It 's just terrible . Without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes , take my word for it , the sex scenes are uninteresting at best . Jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the film ( she does look good ) but it 's all downhill from there .  
  It 's impossible for me to objectively consider this movie . Not that I haven't tried , mind you - but I sit down , and I pop in the aged VHS , and I watch the opening .. and suddenly I 'm five years old again and clutching my very own Care Bear and watching the movie with open eyes and an eager heart . I can see , objectively , that this movie is a BIZARRE combination of cuddly baby merchandising-mascots and creepy prepubescent children with evil powers that has a thin story and uninteresting animation . But my inner five-year-old goes , " Yay ! Care Bears ! " every time I think about it . So - I 'd only ( cautiously , reluctantly ) recommend this movie for those who saw it during their early youth and can call on the awesome power of nostalgia while watching it ( like me ) OR those lovably cynical Gen-X / Y-ers who deliberately seek out the wonderfully bad / strange ( a category in which this movie .. definitely belongs ) . To those actually looking for a compelling movie or wholesome family entertainment : You might want to keep looking .  
  Whenever I make up a list of the absolute worst movies I 've ever seen , this movie is always on it . It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . It took an act of will to sit through the whole thing , and I would sooner spill my own blood than have to sit through it again . What 's wrong with it ? Let me tell you the story of my trip to go see it in the theater . I went to a midnight show , on a Saturday night . I the only ones in the theater were myself , and a bunch of loud , boisterous , rather unruly teenagers , sitting somewhere behind me . They were obviously out having a good time on a Saturday night , and had come to this " comedy " for some laughs . Before the movie starts , during the previews , they were laughing and joking and making loud comments having a grand old time . It was borderline annoying ; had they continued their unbridled enthusiasm into the actual movie , I might 've said something , but I was feeling tolerant and empathetic of their spirited fun , so I let it go . And they did settle down once the movie started . Why am I telling you all this ? Because you can judge this alleged " comedy " by the effect it had not just on myself , but on this rowdy bunch . During the entire run of the film , not one person in the theater laughed . Not once . Not myself , not the boisterous kids . Absolute silence , aside from the soundtrack . And when the film was over and the lights came on , we all , all of us , slowly filed out of the theater in slow , somber , absolute silence . It could 've been a funeral . This was the effect that this " comedy " produced . Not laughter , not enjoyment , but absolute DEPRESSION . It was a depressing , depressing movie , and not the tiniest bit funny . Preachy , self-indulgent , depressing , but not funny . I consider Mel Brooks ' " Blazing Saddles " to be on the short list for Funniest Movie Ever . It still absolutely blows my mind that the same gentleman could be responsible for quite probably the Least Funny Movie Ever . In short : if you 're feeling too happy , give this movie a whirl ; otherwise , don't say I didn't warn you .  
  " House Of Evil " aka " Dance Of Death " of 1968 is the first of four infamous and odd last movies starring the great Boris Karloff and directed by Jack Hill and Juan Ibánez . Unlike " Snake People " ( 1971 ) , " The Incredible Invasion " ( also 1971 ) and " The Fear Chamber " ( 1972 ) which were all released after Karloff 's death in 1969 , " House Of Evil " was released in 1968 , when Karloff was still alive . " House Of Evil " is regarded by many as the worst of these four movies , which are without doubt all rather crappy , but definitely have their entertainment value as the unintentional comedies they are . I personally prefer " The Fear Chamber " and " House Of Evil " over the other two , simply for the reason that the lack of the slightest logic is even more extreme , and since there is no suspense whatsoever in any of the movies , the lack of logic increases the unintentional fun factor . The odd story ( I don't know if I can really call it a ' plot ' ) is set somewhere in Europe in the 19th century . After some girls are murdered and found with their eyes ripped out , Mathias Morteval ( Karloff ) , an enthusiastic organ player , invites his few remaining relatives to his bizarre mansion , which is full of eerie toys . His kinfolk includes Lucy Durant ( Julissa ) , who is engaged to one of the police inspectors investigating the murders . I won't give away more of the story , but I can assure you that it is quite bizarre throughout the movie . There are some very funny moments , especially some things Karloff 's character says . Boris Karloff was without any doubt one of the most brilliant and important icons of the Horror genre who ever lived , and he manages to award this odd movie with a tiny bit of his greatness , and although ( or because ) his role is ( due to a poor script and and directing ) in no way scary , it looks like he deliberately plays it with a sense of humor . Just like in the movie 's successors " Snake People " and " The Fear Chamber " , the female lead is once again played by Julissa . Most of he supporting performances are hilariously amateurish , the cinematography is terrible and the locations and sceneries are beneath contempt . The storyline lacks the least bit of logic and the dialogue often does not make the slightest sense . It is the poor story and dialogue , however , that makes this movie so entertaining to watch . " House Of Evil " may be an extremely crappy attempt of a movie , but it is certainly as ( unintentionally ) funny as it is bad . Fans of Ed Wood 's movies should be very amused , I personally found it hilarious . Crappy but entertaining nevertheless , and definitely worth watching since there 's Boris Karloff in it and due to the fun factor . 3/10  
  I 'm not sure how related they are , but I 'm almost certain that Lost and Delirious is a remake of this movie ( or the story that it 's based on ) . Very similar plotline , and even some of the scenes and sets seem to be very , very similar . Lost & Delirious is actually a much better movie , so see that one instead . This one moves very slowly , but being a late 60s French movie , that is to be expected of the style . Told in a retrospect from the perspective of one of the girls revisiting the school . The editing of the flashbacks with the current scenes is a little bit confusing at first , particularly since the audio from each overlaps ( ie , hearing flashbacks while seeing the present and vice versa ) . Also , the " girls " are a bit old to think that they are in a boarding school . Finally , not much character development to even get you attached to the movie .  
  Great movie - especially the music - Etta James - " At Last " . This speaks volumes when you have finally found that special someone .  
  This movie is by far the worst movie ever made . If you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays Lars in heavyweights than don't make the damn film . I have to say that I could watch Leprechaun in Space 6 times before I could watch the trailer for this POS of a movie . Adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace . Watching this movie is like a mix of listening to Cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender . Anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime . If I had an extra dollar and had to spend it , I 'd give it to the support Lorraina Bobbitt foundation before buying this movie .  
  I saw this movie by accident yesterday at a cinema . I had some hopes for the movie because I really like Spoorloos ( The Vanishing ) and the book it 's based on . The movie starts out okay as it at first seems to be a nice thriller . Quickly though the movie becomes a mess with uninteresting plotlines , characters that are never fleshed out and nobody in the audience cared for ( like Marjoke ) and terrible editing . The movie has fade to black bits that are just way too long , a messed up chronology that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that just don't add anything to the story and could easily have been dropped . After suffering through the story you 'll get treated to one of the worst endings I 've seen in a very long . It should also be mentioned that the movie has lots of explicit sex scenes which you 're probably used to if you watch a lot of dutch movies . It 's hard to mention any good things about this movie . About a third of the audience had already walked out of the theater halfway into the movie and I didn't hear a kind word after the movie was over . Avoid this movie at all costs . it really destroyed any faith I had left in the dutch movie industry .  
  This movie was not made by Who fans . Most of the great moments that fans will look forward to in the half-hour Tommy medley are simply missed or glossed over : In Christmas , they didn't show Daltry 's screams after the line " Tommy doesn't know what day it is .. " , they showed almost * no * Townsend guitar shots in Pinball Wizard , there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of Go to the Mirror , and worst of all , in the second half of We 're Not Gonna Take It ( Listening to You ) , they robbed us of almost every shot of Pete 's blazing guitar chords . Huge chunks of the film are shot from in back of the band . It 's a very frustrating film to watch , and doesn't deliver the goods . I don't know if director Murry Lerner is just not a Who fan , or worse , for him at least , if he * is * a Who fan and this is all the * eight * cameras could deliver for him . To its credit , there are some rare numbers before Tommy , as well as some faves , that are very well shot , and sometimes the editing is brilliant . This might be enough to make some viewers happy , as long as you 're not anticipating Tommy . The sound overall was mediocre in the transmission I watched from DirecTV ; it may be different on video or DVD .  
  I 've never been impressed by JD anyway , and Final Justice ( which I hadn't seen prior to its MST3k airing ) proves to be no exception . It 's not that the character is any less likeable than Mitchell : it 's just that there 's less that Geronimo ( " Call me ' Heronimo ' ) to dislike . In fact , one suspects that Mitchell and Final Justice were all schemes of a revenge-seeking agent of Joe Don 's trying to get the " star " killed by inducing a heart attack . Joe Don must have found a new agent , since he 's now graduated to " comic relief " in James Bond movies . The problem is , it 's hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters there , and his " serious " characters in his action-movies like this one . As for the plot .. umm , what plot ? They repeat the same set pieces so repeatedly you 'll think you were watching Groundhog 's Day 2 . Presumably , the fact they keep using the same scene of Geronimo getting out of jail is supposed to be comic relief of some sort . Umm , yeah , whatever . On the plus side , the Malta scenery is pretty gorgeous , so that kicked it up to a 2 for me . One suspects this flick set Maltese tourism back a couple of decades , though .  
  What reviewers and MST3K left out is the best part ( and only memorable scene ) of this otherwise dreadful movie : There is a very good rape in the shower scene committed by the bad guy ( Ben Gazzara look-alike ) on Maria ( as mentioned , killed later through T.J. 's ineptitude ) . Perhaps rape is too strong a word , " prison mating ritual " may be more appropriate . The background behind this chance , yet forced meeting is the mobster who is hiding " Ben Gazzara , " introduces him to the girls hanging out at his pool . The 30-ish blonde disses him , but our villain must be quite smitten by her , because the courtship is on at that point . His first move is to attempt drowning her , until his mafia don benefactor tells him to knock it off . Kind of like the girl in high school you didn't like , but still wanted to have carnal knowledge of anyway .. Let 's just say , he catches UP with her in the cabana later .  
  I was excited to hear that Cesar Montano had decided to make a movie in the Cebuano language . ( Not ' dialect ' as most Filipinos will incorrectly refer to it as . As Cebuano and Tagalog are as mutually unintelligible as French and Spanish are to each other . ) But I was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie . Being a Canadian , of Cebuano parents , I was optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this film . I was further excited to hear that it wasn't another stupid action movie or melodrama as Filipinos love these types of movies . But alas , I was short-changed . Panaghoy serves as an ego trip for Cesar Montano . Montano of course plays the hero of the movie . And when I say ' hero ' I mean in the most stereotypical of manners ; his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the Bol-anons to victory against the Japanese . His character has no depth or complexity . He just fits the hero mold . The rest of the characters are one dimensional ; they all fit their cookie cutter roles . I 'm all for slow-moving / meditative movies but this movie was just slow moving . It didn't really meditate on anything . Just because a movie is historically-themed , a drama and slow-moving doesn't make it a well-made film . Particularly annoying is the American actor Philip Anthony . His performance was embarrassing . If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan film industry he should have really thought this through . He said he wanted to make Visayan movies that could compete at Cannes and Toronto etc . but really , this movie would have been booed and hissed at at such festivals . To get Visayan films into the mainstream consciousness he should have at least made a movie that would have attracted audiences , even if it meant sacrificing quality . Obviously he didn't think about or get information on what kind of movies garner awards at Cannes so an audience-attracting movie would have been at least a foot in the door . I 'm afraid now that Visayan movies will not be made for a long time again because of this movie . If ever I said to a Filipino that I want to see more Visayan movies of course I 'd get an answer like , " Visayans don't make good movies . Didn't you see Panaghoy Sa Suba ? " Of course this is ludicrous as it is one example of a Visayan movie and probably the only example that anyone nowadays would be likely to see . An example of movies that are meditative , not just slow moving , are the Tagalog film Blackout or David Lynch 's The Straight Story . I hate to promote the Tagalog language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throats of non-Tagalog Filipinos but for the sake of calling a spade a spade I say that Blackout is a VERY good movie . These movies rely heavily on what Hitchcock called ' pure cinema ' . Images without words are used to convey the story . But I bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie . and they do it very well . Panaghoy thinks that if they simply take sweeping shots of the landscape then they have established the mood . And what 's with so many Filipino movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother ?  
  I am a HUGE Adam Sandler fan , and one day I was looking at the Cast & Crew selection on one of his DVD 's and saw ' Going Overboard ' and decided to go out and rent it . So I went out with a few buddies of mine and rented it . We put it on and we were shocked to see an Adam Sandler that didn't hit puberty yet , he looks as if he was 12 when this movie came out . I couldn't even watch 30 minutes of this crap , I didn't laugh , chuckle , or even smirk at this movie , actually the only time I smirked was when I saw how horrid this movie was . I could not believe how hard he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie .. and it didn't work once . Although from seeing the horribly awful camera angles and hearing the disgusting script I realized why I had never heard of this movie , .. because it sucks more than anything has ever sucked before . This movie , in my opinion , was the WORST movie EVER made , .. EVER !  
  Standard procedure for Swedish movies today seem to be to start by throwing plausibility out the window and continue down that path for the rest of the process . Rånarna is another fine example of a movie making very little sense . Banks in Stockholm are being robbed by a highly efficient " military-styled " gang of robbers . Two police officers start investigating the case that soon becomes more complicated than it would appear at first . As usual in Swedish film the cast is mostly made up of the same people you have seen over and over again . Mikael Persbrandt must be in every Swedish film from the last few years ! But that 's OK i guess since Persbrandt is one of few that performs solidly here ( like he usually does ) . The problems with this film mostly revolves around the story itself . First of all the robberies feel mostly like background . Rather this is more a movie about a young policewoman fighting to prove herself in a male world ( like that has not been made a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of Sofia Helin ) . Also there is a completely unbelievable plot twist near the end that seems about as plausible as Aliens landing . But still , i did think it was a quite nice touch considering i was half asleep right about then . It spiced things up a bit ( and actually saved the rating from dropping another step ) . In the end the main problem is the same thing as with most other Swedish movies of this kind . Simply that the action and suspense doesn't live up to the standards we are used to from other movies of this kind ( mostly Hollywood ) . It feels cheap and rather weak in comparison . In my opinion Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting , and forget about trying to make " Hollywood-action light " like they do now . Because this becomes yet another forgettable effort from the Swedish movie-industry . I rate it 3/10 .  
  Much like the early horror film The Boogens , the devious unseen killer is quite a letdown when it finally becomes seen . Although Animal House 's Stephen Furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest , his performance is more comedy than horror . The plot , an extremely tired one , has three sexy women ( Bach , Lamm and Lois Young ) unable to find a hotel for the evening , so they willingly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator , exceptionally played by the deceased Sydney Lassick . If you have ever seen any horror film , you know that lovable IL ' Sydney is a deranged psycho , so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies . The three women are all very attractive , especially Barbara Bach , but Lois Young ( a Helen Hunt clone ) is the only one to go nude , as Sydney watches her take a bath .  
  This movie was so predictable . Its a complete rip off of those , " I was abused by daddy I 'm gonna kill women " movies . Stupid scenes , bad acting , unoriginal storyline , really low budget piece of crap film . Don't waste your time people . Trust me . My rating : 0/5.0  
  Barry , a medical transcriptionist has his mind corroding from his job coupled with memories of an abusive upbringing at the hands of his stepfather , Barry ( the original Leatherface Gunnar Hansen ) . He spirals into madness and eventually a serial killer . Good ( in the form of a gay man ) and evil ( in the form of a bald mute guy ) battle for control of his soul . This film is undone by some bad acting and unintentional humorous scenes . Not to say it 's horrible or anything , just that you cal tell that it 's only as known as it is on account of Bruce Campbell 's rabid fan base ( of which I am one ) who will likely see anything he 's in or involved with in some way . My Grade : C- DVD Extras : Commentary with Michael Kallio , and Bruce Campbell ; Second commentary by Kallio and Sound designer Joel Newport ; ' Hating every minute ' a 17 minute documentary ; deleted and extended scenes ; alternate takes ; outtakes , footage of the world premiere ; Poster & still gallery ; Talent bios ; and theatrical trailer DVD-Rom : Screenplay in .

  Interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event , even though he did save many other captive children . The film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways , bathrooms and even class rooms . In other words , the High School is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal . Dolph Lundgren , ( Sam Decker ) plays the soldier / school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field . However , the principal asks him to have a Detention Class as his last duty as a teacher . It is at this point in the film when all Hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete BOMB . Try to enjoy it , if you decided to View IT !  
  This may be the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical ever . Even the music has been destroyed . Attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and moment ring false . I will say , though , that it is almost bad enough to be funny . The hairstyles are remarkably dated . I can not for the life of me understand what is meant ( conceptually ) by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where " A Chorus Line " is playing . Are we to think that these people are auditioning for " A Chorus Line , " which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning ? Oh no , the show is collapsing on itself . I saw the original production , and have listened to the album hundreds of times . Why , oh , why , did they do this ?  
  This film 's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the DVD . However , the resulting movie is absolutely dire ! Admittedly , this is not the worst film ever made , or the worst film this year , but it came damn close ! The main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be : comedy , adult drama , thriller , teen-porn ? The story is interesting , as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides , but the film is a mess . What starts out as a mildly interesting " comedy " ( a word I use in the loosest possible terms ) , then goes totally in reverse , and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller . Nicole Kidman should know better , and Ben Chaplin is wasted ! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel , whom I can only presume did this for the money . This is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect . It 's not funny , it 's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive Benny Hill for everything he did , and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty . A film to be avoided , unless you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in every one of their films !  
  OK , forget all the technical inconsisties or the physical impossibilities of the Space Shuttle accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold . Forget the hideous special effects and poorly-constructed one-dimensional characters . Just looking at the premise of the story . The very reason for the film to exist in the first place , and you will see just how badly this film was pieced together . I know 9 year olds that look at this insult to the intelligence and just laugh at it . The story is horrible . The acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible . And whats worse , is that the cable Movie channels KEEP SHOWING IT ! Its on twice a day every two or three days ! Why does anyone in their right mind think that people would want to see this painful piece of celluloid multiple times , much less to see it at all ? My recomendation is dont even bother spending the energy to watch this thing . Its just not worth it .  
  I went to see this film at the cinemas and i was shocked when I got in the room . There was only me and my girlfriend ! This shouted to me that this film is not very good . Not to my surprise , the film was dire . Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas . It is a very predictable narrative with him falling in love with the girl that hates him . His acting is OKish but for the comedy aspect of the film he is not very good . The plot line is poor and the comedy almost non-existent . However , there are some good points . For example , the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny . I hope this review stops other people wasting their money . I was very embarrassed when I came out of the room !  
  And when I watch Sarah Silverman , I get the same results . I love quirky , irreverent humor . BUT this woman is so darned B O R I N G , annoying , and yawn-worthy . She 's also totally lacking in anything whatsoever humorous . The deadpan way she tries to deliver her lines is just dead on arrival because she 's just not funny . I watched two segments of her program and was ready for Novocaine . Geez , my kid ( age 19 ) saw her promos on Comedy Central and said she was a " dumb chick . " I thought that was a compliment . The one where she says " Watch my show or I 'll kill my dog , " is actually believable . I know she 's a wanna be comedienne . She just comes across as a warped nut-case . I just don't ever want to see her around MY dog .  
  What we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money & revenge can corrupt your soul .. or something like that . Guy Ritchie , a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre , bites off more than he can chew with this one . His use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by swallowing his pride , being nice to his enemy & giving away all his money falls flat on it 's face . When Jason Statham 's character no longer fears Ray Liotta , it apparently drives Liotta crazy enough to blow his head off in the final scene . Why ? Basically you cannot set up a mafiosi like the Liotta character , who has presumably got to his station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behaviour evident throughout the film , only then to have him driven to suicide by nothing more than a pitying smile on the face of Statham 's character . Before anyone starts to say I 'm missing the point .. I 'm not . I get it OK ? Opt out of the quest for riches & you 'll find true happiness and inner peace . Be nice to your enemy and this will confuse him into self-destruction . This seems to be the gist of the movie and in itself this is not a bad premise for a story , although hardly original . The problem is that Ritchie simply doesn't have the skill as a movie maker to carry it off . At the moment when even Guy Ritchie realises this , he appears to get bored with the story and begins to insert red-herrings : The scene when Statham gets knocked over by a car - Why ? The shooting of some scenes as Marvel comic animations .. again , why ? There are so many loose threads & unanswered questions left at the end of the movie you could get all 2001-ish about it and try figuring them out , or simply accept that there are no answers & each viewer will interpret things in their own way . Myself ? I was so bored with the pompous tone of the film that I simply didn't care . Frankly the ending couldn't come too soon so that I didn't have to sit through any more of this pretentious psychobabble . A waste of two hours of my life .  
  Well , there you have it , another disillusion on my account . Two , actually ! First of all , even though I like to think of myself that I know a little something about 70 's euro-exploitation and its most prolific contributors , I never heard about Joseph W . Sarno before . Here 's a guy who made over seventy rancid and cult-laden exploitation movies and I haven't seen a single one ! How ? Why ? What happened here ? Secondly , and even worse , just when you think to have found a new source for obscure cult movies , that director 's most famous and supposed " masterpiece " turns out to be an irredeemably dull and irritating film . Admittedly , lesbian vampire movies form a pretty insignificant sub genre as a whole , but some of them bath in ominous atmosphere and curious sensuality ( like José Larraz ' " Vampyres " or Harry Kümmel 's " Daughters of Darkness " ) . Joseph Sarno 's film has nothing to offer , except copious amounts of gratuitous nudity and even that becomes boring rather quickly . The events take place in a secluded old castle , hidden deep in the German mountains , where five centuries ago lived a malicious and bloodthirsty ( literally ) baroness . Her loyal disciples still throw naked dance parties in the castle 's catacombs , which are lit by penis-shaped candlesAUCH , and hope to resurrect the baroness any time soon now . Suddenly ( don't even ask how ) the castle is full of young and sexy female guests , so even more erotic rites ensue . Sounds delicious and entertaining enough , but " The Devil 's Plaything " contains a massive number of sequences where literally nothing happens and where the cast members ' ignorant facial expressions are simply unendurable ! Sarno isn't capable of creating suspense or building a Gothic atmosphere ( or maybe he just didn't bother to ) and the actresses ' capacities restrict themselves to standing in front the camera topless and pull a really pathetic face . Please do yourself a favor : no matter how desperately you strive to see all lurid lesbian-vampire movies of the 70 's , this one isn't worth a penny ! Even the repertoires of Jess Franco and Jean Rollin are pure art compared to this dud .  
  This film is the worst film , but it ranks very high for me . It is how a slasher movie should be . It takes place at a university in which there only seems to be a handful of students . The teachers are dumber than a sack of hammers . It is filled with good Catholic priest , sexually repressed humor . Bad hair , bad clothes . The dialogue is so cliched it is hard to believe that I was able to predict lines in quotes . The slashings have some creativity and seem to revolve around stabbing people in the genitalia . A lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die because they are so bad , I recommend this film for a fun time . Get a case of cheap beer and some friends , watch it and laugh .  
  An art house maven 's dream . Overrated , overpraised , overdone ; a pretentious melange that not only did not deserve Best Picture of 1951 on its own merits , it was dwarfed by the competition from the start . Place in the Sun , Detective Story , Streetcar Named Desire , Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man ; you name it , if it came out in ' 51 , it 's better than this arthouse crapola . The closing ballet is claptrap for the intellectual crowd , out of place and in the wrong movie . Few actors in their time were less capable ( at acting ) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron . My # 12 Worst of ' 51 ( I saw 201 movies ) , and among the 5 worst Best Picture Oscar winners .  
  Despite some mildly thought-provoking oddities in the script and the film 's overall curiosity value , Fury of the Wolfman emerges as a dull , uninteresting excursion into lycanthropy , saved only by the statuesque presence of villainess Perla Cristal . The rest of the players , including the hammy Naschy , are a complete write-off ( though admittedly none are helped by often atrocious dubbing ) . Although the screenplay packs in enough variations on werewolf / Frankenstein / Dr Moreau themes to flesh out a dozen movies , the plot is so unevenly developed , the characterizations so feeble and the dialogue so verbosely ridiculous ( at least in the English version ) , that any latent interest in the turgid proceedings is soon quashed . Zabalza 's direction seems jerky , even amateurish . His staging is clumsy and ineffective . He is not helped by Villasenor 's over-bright lighting . Even promising sets are so unatmospherically photographed that the director 's few attempts to give the audience a fright are signaled far in advance Other credits fall into a similar pattern of ineptitude , though the stridently over-emphatic music score and the laughably crude , totally primitive special effects deserve special condemnation .  
  Not the best of actors ' movies . The director has concentrated on projected actor 's stardom rather than giving a good entertainer . May be hero himself , his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it . But definitely it 's not worth for neutral audience . The fight sequences are a total comedy . The dance moves in the song sequences are pathetic . The music is average . This film was the biggest flop for the actor . Inspite of the hype created over the movie , the movie failed miserably . Don't even think of watching this move even if you want to kill time . You can watch some cartoon instead . A good movie buff cannot digest this crap for 2 1/2 hours .  
  There are moments in this unique cartoon of pure beauty but overall it 's not very good . Limited animation as well as sub standard character and background design will limit its mass market appeal . The character design looks like a cross between the original Star Wars Clone Wars and Disney 's Kim Possible , ( Brendan , the main character in this also bares an uncanny similarity to Ron Stoppable in Kim Possible ) Background design ranges as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark , yet by today 's standards , overall it is still poor and cheap looking . Many of the backgrounds bare resemblances to eastern European or Nordic animation from the mid 80 's , nice in its own way but for modern child audiences , used to CG slug fests and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body swaying in the wind , is sure to disappoint . The story is also not overly engaging and many of the voice actors aren't overly impressive , noticeably the usually brilliant Brendan Gleeson who appears to be phoning in his part . There are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly cliché and stereotypically racist . However , some of the characters are good , the Viking villains , although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound . There is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by Wolves from a Viking attack that is very nicely put together . The look and feel also seemed to be very inspired by the film Watership Down including a blatant rip off / homage to the Ghost Rabbit of Inlay . The look is also clearly and obviously inspired by Gaelic / Celtic / Anglo Saxon art so if you are into these subjects you may be drawn towards its look . The film also does have moments of very nicely structured shots leading the eye in a very artistic manner , including a pretty match cut and a large scale Viking attack that is very moody and impressive . Best of all though is the music , much of the background music is melodic and moving , specifically the song by the spirit girl which is truly beautiful and haunting and works very well with the images it covers . If the whole film was as poetic as this moment , ( and it tries , ) then this would be a very beautiful and poetic film that would sadly still not reach a wide audience , but instead it isn't a shame it wont reach a wider audience because most of it is average and cheap looking and doesn't stand up to modern animation standards . Overall a film that clearly split my opinion in many ways , but all together not great but worth watching for the music and song and the occasional pretty or scary moment . Oh yeah and the cat seemed to live for a long time , not sure how that was possible .  
  When I first heard about " Down To Earth , " I was pretty excited . I 'm a pretty big fan a Chris Rock , he was especially hilarious in Dogma . But this film proved to be a disappointment . Chris Rock 's performance was not nearly as good as his past performances , and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole . First off , Chris Rock . He plays the entire movie as a standup comedy routine . Obviously , this works fine in the scenes where he 's supposed to be doing standup , but in the rest of the movie , it doesn't . Even when he 's talking to one other character , he seems to think he 's trying to make a roomful of people laugh . He has a few funny moments , but they mostly come during the standup scenes ( no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian ) . As for the rest of the cast , they 're pretty much there just to give Rock someone to talk to , none of them stand out . Also , the movie was poorly directed . The movie has basically a one-joke plot : old white guy acting like a young black comedian . While I prefer movies with more than one joke , this still could have worked , and been quite funny . The problem was , we saw too much of Rock and not enough of the old white guy . It 's supposed to be funny because it 's this white guy telling Chris Rock 's jokes , but for most of the time , we just see Chris Rock , so it 's not nearly as funny . The few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy talking like Rock are , in fact , hilarious . If he had been shown more , the movie would have been a lot funnier . Overall , a few moments of laughter can't make up for the fact that " Down To Earth " is poorly acted , and poorly directed . This one was a pretty big disappointment . Rating : 4/10  
  First of all ; it 's very dilettantish to try describe way of history only from positions of guns , germs and steel . The same tried to do Marxists from economical positions . The reason of Western success can't be just dumb luck , the advantages of domesticated plants and animals . We see , that all around the world any advantages and bonuses are complete useless if they aren't wisely managed . In the Japan there isn't huge natural resources , but Japan is one of the top world economies , the same situation in Singapore , but in Nigeria , country with rich oil resources , there are only middle-low success . Both of this nations had and still have access to Western technology and inventions , but why such gap ? In the end of movie Daimond declared , that it 's very important to understand factors of guns , germs and steel , to UNDERSTAND . Maybe the main factor of world 's difference is not geography , but people ability to understand and use things ? The mental ability to understand . And in this case geography is only subordinated .  
  I got this movie out of Blockbuster in one of those racks were you can get like 5 movies for 20 bucks . I 'd have to say I got my money 's worth on this one . I had expected horrible dialogue , crappy monsters , and shaky cameras . Well , as Meatloaf said , two outta three ain't bad . The acting is bad , though not as bad as some movies I 've seen . Or maybe I 've watched so many low budget movies recently I 've lost perspective . There are some bits were the acting is downright terrible , but for the most part it 's of at least High School Play level . The CG for the Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second-worst part . The first thing I thought when I saw it ( and I noticed another reviewer agreed with me ) was that a man in an ape suit would have been better . Clunky stop-motion animation would have looked better . So you may be asking why I call the CG the second-worst part . That 's because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects . They are loud , annoying , and constant . I 've been camping , I know what insects sound like in the woods at night , and while they can be loud , they 're not deafening like the cacophony in this movie . Usually when the " background " sounds drown out the movie 's dialogue , it 's a bad thing , but from what I caught of the dialogue of this film , I wasn't missing much . The action was infrequent and boring . The tension was non-existent , as was any sense of empathy with the characters . Speaking of the characters , they were all cookie-cutter and bland . The only mildly engaging byplay was between .. actually , I can't think of anything . There was a line or two that made me crack a wan smile , but that was about it . The cinematography was decent , a step or two above what you 'd normally see in a movie like this . However , it still had that " home movie " quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket change and a prayer . If you 're like me and get a kick out of shoestring budget genre flicks , and you see this one in the dollar bin , think about grabbing it . Otherwise , stay away at all costs .  
  Don't even ask me why I watched this ! The only excuse I can come up with that I was sick with Bronchitis and too weak to change the channel . : ) It 's too terrible for words , the movie that is , not the Bronchitis . The acting is deplorable , Richard Grieco hams it up as a trigger-happy , gun-slinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops . Nick Mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and Nancy Allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film . The script is dismal , peppered with clichéd lines , " Are you ready , Pardner ? " purrs Richard Grieco to every single one of his victims . Dire . Avoid .  
  There is a lot to like here . The actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit , likable family . However , for that reason the film does not ring true . We see Leo , who apparently just learned of his HIV positive diagnosis , essentially react in a way that is not in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself . As well , the film ends somewhat abruptly avoiding what Leo , his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him . The young actor who plays Leo 's brother , Marcel , is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast . Unfortunately , the scriptwriters could not decide onwhether they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of HIV on a functional , appealing family or what the devastation HIV is on the victim - so it only hints at both . While this film provides food for thought it leaves the viewer wanting much more than it delivers .  
  .. but the keyword here is " usually . " I have been known to adore movies EVERYONE thinks are dumb . But in the world of B-rated movies , THIS one is Z-rated . Absolutely ridiculous . The thing I respect about most of my favorite B-rated movies are that they don't take themselves too seriously . The makers of movies like that sort-of treat the movie lightly , even if it 's a heavy topic . I get the impression , however , that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously , like they were putting together a 10-star classic , complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots . Nevertheless , despite all this , I STILL gave it 4 out of 10 stars , as I am biased towards movies like this . If you 're a B-rated fan , however , I would try too hard to find this one .  
  Don't get me wrong , I 'm a huge fan of many of Woody 's movies , obviously his late 70 's masterpieces ( Annie Hall , Interiors , Manhattan ) and most of his late 80 's / early 90 's dramas ( Hannah , Crimes and Misdemeaners , Husbands and Wives ) in fact I even liked some of his more recent efforts ( Melinda , Anything Else , Small Time Crooks ) but this was abysmal , I though it couldn't possibly be any worse than last years Match Point but how wrong I was . It was lazily plotted - basically a cross between Match Point , Manhattan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks , with all the jokes taken out - Woody seems to be on the way out as well , slurring most of his lines and delivering ' hilarious ' catchphrases ' I mean that with all due respect .. ' over and over until the blandness of it all becomes to much to bare . I know that most actors are queuing up to work with him but they should at least read the script first - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are so much better than this - and Woody should really take a more behind the camera role in future , if he has any sense about 20 miles behind it . It wouldn't be so tragic if we didn't have so many great Woody films to compare this to - but it is clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort , Woody should call it a day before he becomes an industry joke . Embarrassingly bad  
  The only redemption was the small part by Larry Miller . It seemed that the movie was trying too hard to be " Something About Mary , " but I didn't even like that movie and it still fell short of those standards . The actor who plays Paul was great , but Selma Blair is stuck in the stupidity of her Cruel Intentions character . James Brolin was great , but Paul 's father seemed like he was trying too hard to be the Randy Quaid character from the National Lampoon 's Vacation movies .  
  I had hoped this movie was going to be mildly entertaining , like other sorts of its genre . However , it was lame and I didn't find myself laughing very much . Watch it on HBO , maybe , or if you 've got a free rental to waste and you need a movie to pass the time . But I don't recommend paying to see it . The plot is simple and straightforward , and it could have been funny , maybe , if the script was better . Jason Lee can be hilarious , and he gets a few laughs here and there , but the movie falls flat . Just don't go see this one . The directing is lackluster , but for what it is , directing isn't that important . I guess its main drawback is that it is just not very funny . See something else , don't waste your time here .  
  Jason Lee does his best to bring fun to a silly situation , but the movie just fails to make a connect . Perhaps because Julia Stiles character seems awkward as the conniving and sexy soon to be cousin-in-law . Maybe it is because she and Selma Blair 's characters should have been cast the opposite way . ( Selma Blair seems more conniving than Julia would be ) . Either way this movie is yet another Hollywood trivialization of a possibly real world situation ( that being getting caught with your pants out at your bachelor party not stooping your cousin ) , which while having promise fails to deliver . There are some laughs to be sure and the cast ( even if miscast ) do their best with sub grade material which doesn't transcend its raunchy topic . So instead of getting a successful raunch fest ( ie Animal House or American Pie ) we are left with a middle ground of part humor and part stupidity ( ala Meatballs 2 or something ) .  
  Besides being boring , the scenes were oppressive and dark . The movie tried to portray some kind of moral , but fell flat with its message . What were the redeeming qualities ? On top of that , I don't think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did .  
  I have grown up reading Modesty Blaise , both the comics and the books , and she truly is a heroine to me . Although not being a great fan of Quentin Tarantino I anyway was interested to hear a few years back that he was considering making a film of her : could he finally give Modesty a nice big screen treatment she 's worthy of ? I heard of ' My Name Is Modesty ' a few months ago and checked the stars it had been given here , and wasn't too surprised to find out the score was not too high , since beloved characters often have hard time melting the fans ' heart if not done exactly right . So I decided not to read any reviews and see the film instead , and well , I just finished watching it , and I 'm stunned , and sad , and yeah , pretty furious , too . Sad and furious of giving over an hour of my time seeing something so fabulous as Modesty Blaise-character being turned into a film that has nothing to give to a viewer or a fan . It seems that almost everything about this film is sub-par and unprofessional , although I must admit seeing some actors in other films earlier where they were fine so I can't blame them . But the screenplay and the directing .. my god , why even make this kind of crap with production values slightly bigger than your average TV-film but done much worse ? I don't know the background of this film and actually I really don't want to know , but I just can't help wondering that how on earth could Tarantino with a straight face tell that he loves Modesty and then put his name on this ? He just lost a huge amount of respect in my eyes . The director was not the right man for this job and I can honestly thank him for ruining my night . I give this film 3 stars and those stars go to the actors and the technical quality which could 've been worse . The other seven stars missing are what this film was not good at . Oh well , hopefully at some point there will be a serious production of The Modesty Blaise Movie that has some other goals than to steal money from the Modesty fans . Although if people like Tarantino are the ones making the decisions I 'm not holding my breath .  
  I got a DVD of " Bogeyman " and this stunker was an extra feature . I assumed that it was " Boogeyman II " because it was paired with the original . But you know what they say about those who " assume " : it makes an " ass - " out of " u- " and " me . " I had read before viewing that BII contains a lot of footage from the original and that it starred actress Love . While watching " Return of the Boogeyman , " I decided to stick around through the original footage to see the notorious death-by-toothbrush scene . Before I knew it , the film was over . Rip-off . I think that I thought this was BII because this has a similar title to one of BII 's alternate titles . Oh well , at least this was just an extra feature , right ? Let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about the movie 's mistakes . Many , many , mistakes . Who does this guy Ulli Whatever think he is ? Does he really think the same movie will sell in different forms . There is nothing original holding Part II up . It is basically a flashback of the original through the eyes of a psychic , who is giving us a gruelingly boring play-by-play as everything happens . That 's the movie . Oh , and one death-by-stereo scene , but you can read that off someone else 's review . My interest in " Boogeyman II " is forever lost . Final Note : This is not a series of films to watch back to back .  
  What a dog of a movie . Noni Hazelhurst 's performance is quite good , but it sits amidst a jungle of abhorrent scriptwriting , mediocre direction and wooden acting from the bulk of the cast . Many of the characters are woefully miscast , particularly the ever overrated Colin Friels . Very little works in this pretentious garbage . Much of the " character development " is done through a silly , angst-ridden voice over and frequently completely contradicts the behaviour of characters on-screen . In fact , it 's hard to even figure out who the voice overs are talking about because they describe such different characters to who we see on screen ! How are we meant to know Colin Friels ( Javo ) is meant to be an erratic , violent and unreliable junkie ? One of these silly voice overs tells us . For crying out loud , the nature of his character is half the point of the movie and the only thing that lets us know is a flippin ' voice over ! The real killer is the characters . Everything about them . Their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the rack , despite the fact we are constantly reminded they are meant to be artsy paupers . They are all absurdly well-spoken for " junkies " . None seem to have any real comprehension of life on the skids or on smack and yet this is meant to be the case with most of them . Monkey Grip deserves no more attention than a weekday TV movie matinée . Crud like this , perfectly well shot and technically presented , but a cliché-driven angsty drama that shoots so wide of being plausible and meanders about for hours without really going anywhere . At least Noni gets down to her birthday suit at every given opportunity . There 's no other sane reason to endure this junk .  
  Granted , I 'm not the connoisseur d'horror my partner is , but a well put together , clever flick is worth the time . My quibbles , in brief : - Dialog often weak and at times unbelievable coming from the given character . - Unconvincing acting . - Storyline never really caught fire . The writers plucked choice bits from half a dozen mainstream films , tossed into a kettle , simmered not nearly enough and tried feeding us poor saps the resulting mess , al'dente . Long and short , while not absolutely terrible , it was definitely not worthy of absorbing one of my NetFlix rentals .  
  This movie really has no beginning or end . And it 's really VERY unbelievable . Mary-K and Ashley are supposed to be interns working in a mailing room for an Italian fashion company . But , for some reason , they 're put up in a 5-star hotel ( conveniently located across the street from the Coliseum ) , and all of the other interns they work with are just as abnormally model-looking as they are . One thing that I found obvious in this movie is the way that one of the twins DOESN'T end up with the guy . I guess they tried to twist their usual plot a bit . Nice try .  
  I 'm a true fan of the original Cracker series , and own all of them on DVD . Cracker had a tendency to be over-the-top on occasion , but Robbie Coltrane and the other cast members , as well as the writers , always seemed to carry it off despite themselves . I count the original Cracker among the great Brit TV crime series of that time , and there 's some stiff competition : Prime Suspect , Inspector Frost , Inspector Morse , Jeremy Brett 's Sherlock Homes , and a host of others . Cracker , along with Prime Suspect , was on the top of my list . Which makes " A New Terror " all the more sad .. Ultimately , this was a very pale imitation of Cracker 's former glory . I forced myself to sit through the whole thing , convinced that it couldn't actually be this bad , and that some spark would eventually ignite . I was wrong , it was bad from beginning to end . A few criticisms : First , just to get any potential bias up-front right off : I was offended by the anti-American , anti-war screed that droned on and on throughout most of the show . The topper : the murder of two American 's innocent of any crime and a British Junkie is , in Fitz 's words , " understandable , but not justified " . I thought " I waded through two hours of crap just to hear this disgusting bit of drivel ? " So I had a negative reaction to the anti-war / American tone brought on by my beliefs .. Beyond the politics , I had the distinct sense that this Cracker was merely a prop for the propaganda , and it actually helped to undermine an already terribly weak script . Second , just how much air-time did Robbie Coltrane get ? Fitz was almost a bit player in this one , as if he was an afterthought plugged into some story originally written without any thought of Fitz 's role . Coltrane could have carried the show on his own broad and still suitably flabby shoulders , but the writer was apparently thinking of other things , and missed the chance , and by a wide margin . Third : WHAT AN ABYSMAL SCRIPT ! There was some sparkle , and a couple of bits of actual character development ( Fitz 's son ranting that Fitz couldn't stay at his house if he missed his plane to Australia , the Detective that liked to beat his poor-performers over the backs of their heads , and some of the old sparks between Fitz and his Missus ) but not nearly enough to carry the tedious storyline . Fourth , where the hell was Panhallagan ? Now that would have been interesting .. It was Manchester after all , and 10 years on she 'd be up in the ranks . Another wasted opportunity ( or perhaps the actress wasn't interested ? ) Well , there 's much more ( that 's bad ) to say , but I 'll close with a curiosity : at the end of the show ( as it aired on BBCA ) , when the advertisement announced that the " Director 's Cut " was available on BBC On-Demand , I thought AH-HA ! The Director 's cut , which , presumably , one has to pay for , might have all of the goodies I expected to see tonight but never did , like a coherent , interesting storyline . Unfortunately , after convincing myself to sit through the horrible free version of " A New Terror " with the hope of seeing something , anything , worth watching , only to be disappointed , I have no hope left to motivate me to actually pay for a second , potentially longer and more tedious version . Besides , it angered me to think that BBCA sliced and diced , and sacrificed show time to accommodate the endless ( every ten minutes or so ) stream of commercials , and then turned around and asked me to pay for what probably should have been version aired tonight . To close , I quote the first paragraph of Variety 's review of " A New Terror " : it really says it all : " Initial excitement about Robbie Coltrane reprising his role as the BBC 's flawed , boozing , womanizing criminal psychologist is snowed under by the heavy-handed political statement writer Jimmy McGovern is determined to deliver within this revival vidpic . Jolting at first in its message - namely , that Americans are a bunch of whiny namby-pambies who didn't care a whit about terrorism before it came crashing onto our doorstep - McGovern 's chest-clearing rant overwhelms the narrative and mutes the pleasure of seeing Fitz back on the case . "  
  I will never be a member of any club that would have me , especially this one . Starr Andreeff is a single mom / stripper who gets attacked by a female vampire and left for dead . She begins to get a hankering for blood , and meets up with John Savage , looking like he 's wondering where he left Michael Cimino 's phone number . Savage is also a vampire and wants to let Andreef join his little vampire family , which consists of a British vamp , the blonde vamp who attacked Starr , and a green haired midget ( I am not making this up ) . The family does not want Starr , so they try to kill Savage and Starr and Starr 's kid . Someone forgot to tell John Savage that this was a drama . He spends most of his screen time exhibiting more facial tics than Hugh Grant on a Jolt Cola bender , and he reads all of his lines like he is making a Farrelly Brothers film . Andreeff tries to make the most of a badly written role , but screenwriter / director Ruben goes for all the vampire cliches , like Starr eating her son 's pet hamster and buying a lot of raw meat to fight the craving for blood . The kid also gets knocked around a lot , for those who think watching violence against children is really entertaining . The film is extra gory , but not in a wild , over the top way like " Killer Tongue . " Here , the gore is gross and never justified , it just occurs . It is just in the budget . Most of the R rating goes to Andreeff 's coworkers , who are put through embarassing strip routines in the background of conversation scenes . The budget does not include vampire fangs ! All the vampires here must stab their prey to eat . Nifty idea , unless you have already seen George Romero 's " Martin . " Even at 77 minutes , and once you throw in Ruben 's attempts at arty direction ( skewed frames , blurred scenes ) , this is one tiresome , dull , and dirty ride . Leave this club and take a shower , you will need it . This is rated ( R ) for strong physical violence , gun violence , sexual violence , strong gore , strong profanity , female nudity , sexual references , drug abuse , and adult situations .  
  To sat how awful The Shield is , you 'd have to write pages and pages , so suffice it to say that it is a monument to bad directing . " When Directors Go Awry " should have been the title of this production . Indeed , directors are supposed to infuse their work with a sense of visual style and story-telling that propels the story forward . How is constantly shaking the camera and playing with the zoom lens a " style " ? How is it propelling the story forward ? Of course there 's also the " editing by random numbers " nonsense . Apparently it 's become hip to just cut randomly . I guess it 's too much work to do good editing . Well , that made it too much work for most people to watch The Shield which languished as one of the most over-hyped and unwatched shows of all time .  
  Set in South Africa , a young black guy tries to land a part in a ' gangsta ' movie . But with no knowledge of street life , he 's told to find out what that life is really like or he won't get the part . He manages to work his way into a gang led by an old friend of his from school and his chances of appearing in the film decline as he commits crimes to be accepted . But for the gang 's leader , the burgeoning disaster of his new friend 's life suggests a golden opportunity to do something better with his own . While that may sound relatively interesting , it 's anything but . The first half of it is incredibly meandering and tedious , while the " hijacking " only takes place towards the end with some very poorly executed low speed car chases . In those " chases " , only two police cars are used , both of which are early 90 's Nissan Sunny 's . Not only would these be rather cheap to pick up ( and I find it rather hard to believe they 'd be using such mundane old cars in South Africa in the year 2000 ) , but as far as I can remember , there 's only 2 involved and none of them get a scratch once . The car chases are very badly shot , with distant and badly timed camera angles and minimal traffic on the roads , and they 're all over in around 2 minutes at maximum as you 're supposed to believe that a very small kid is actually a highly skilled driver who can easily evade the police despite the driving being pedestrian and utterly unexciting . This now leads me onto the characters and the acting , which are equally bad . The aforementioned kid who drives the car , looks about 13 years old and supposedly is extremely skilled at losing the incredibly inept police . Everybody else is equally unconvincing , so much that they even look bored at times themselves . At the closing scene of the movie , our main character ( " Sox Moraka " ) is asked by the gang leader to steal a car from a car park . While having trouble opening it , the Police arrive and ask him what he 's doing and he replies by telling him it 's their car . After a brief argument they try to arrest him and he then holds the Police at gunpoint and jumps back in their car . After he 's in , the Police return fire and in turn he gets wounded . After another pathetic chase sequence , they decide to abandon the car and set it alight to destroy any evidence . What follows here is one of the most downright laughable and hideously awful special effects I 've ever seen . When the car " explodes " , superimposed flames suddenly appear from every window with awful sound effects that aren't even in time . It 's so badly done and so phony looking that it 's hard to even put it into words , and really needs to be seen to be believed . If you watch it in slow motion it looks even funnier . I 've seen better effects than this in murder reconstruction documentaries . The car is a Volkswagen Golf MK2 GTi . Something that wouldn't be worth a huge amount at all , and they seriously couldn't afford to destroy it with a real explosion ? I 'd love to know how large the budget for this movie was . It feels so cheap that I 'm surprised it made it outside of South Africa , and even more surprised it made it to a DVD release . I know it 's not a big budget Hollywood production . I know it 's meant to depict gangs in impoverished townships of South Africa who steal cars from the middle class in and sell the parts on the black market , but with the laughable effects , poorly executed car chases , awful acting and ludicrous characters , any sense of reality is completely lost . Overall , I most certainly do NOT advise you to watch this . If you want to have a laugh and see one of the most poorly done , low budget messes of amovie ever created , then I 'd recommend it for that , and only that . It is a wretched , poorly made , poorly edited , poorly paced and tedious piece of low budget drivel that fails on all counts . I 've seen many South African movies , including lots of cheap NuImage / Nu-World action pictures , and despite their cheesiness , they 're far better than this on all counts .  
  good lord ! ( and that coming from an atheist ) , this " movie " is bad ! much has already been said by the reviewers before ( the ones who rated this piece 3 and below ) to which I fully agree , I just like to add a few things : among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products , got chopped up by an Axe , raped by a broomstick , had their balls blown away - the ex-boyfriend suffers the worst torture while having to listen to the girl 's endless and pointless babble at the kitchen table ( as do we , but at least we have the mercy of the mute button ) . had the director cut out the point - and endless graveyard and inverted scenes , our suffering would have been over after 30 minutes . the only things that made this flick at least somewhat bearable are Emily Haack 's tits ( one point ) . forget it . don't buy it . don't waste your time . and your sanity . my brain is so fried after watching this I feel the urgent need to watch ( and suffer ? ) " Scrapbook " right now .  
  The bad news is it 's still really dreadful . I gave it a 2 because occasionally some of this kitchy slapstick parody actually seems funny . It 's supposed to be better than " Mulva , Zombie Ass Kicker " , and progress should be rewarded . Or maybe I was drinking heavily when I watched it and felt generous . Whatever , " 2 " it is . Maybe the best thing about this movie is that it 's over pretty quick . It takes elements from most of Kill Bill I & II 's key themes and fight scenes , hacks them up , dumbs them way down , dirties up the dialog , and squishes the whole mess into about an hour of truly awful amateur video . You 'd best smoke a lot of something powerful if you want to enjoy this one . And get this DVD back to the video store on time ! You 'll really hate yourself if you have to pay a late fee .  
  This is probably the best horror film made since Ed Wood died . I can't spoil the ending , because I have absolutely no idea what happened . I 'll try my best , though . There are some kind of lesbian vampires , but they keep swapping bodies , so any character might or might not be the character you 're supposed to think it is , or it might be a lesbian vampire . Sound confusing ? It 's not as confusing as you might think , since none of the characters make any sense to begin with . There 's no plot , no character development , and random people show up , speak a few lines , and then disappear , never to be heard from again . There are also zombies , who are * possibly * the enemies of the vampires , but there 's also a dream within a dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital , so maybe none of this actually happened , and it 's all the main character 's hallucination . The upside ? Both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly . The special effects are simply mind-boggling ( I particularly liked the incredibly slow , awkward fight sequences ) . Everyone has a really silly Canadian accent , which adds to the general level of hilarity . Well worth the price of rental . We laughed until we cried .  
  This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen ! I can honestly say I have never seen a movie worse than this one ! AND I MEAN NEVER ! I 'm a BIG fan of " B " horror movies . As you may imagine .. I 've been exposed to some of worst that the movie industry has to offer . I was lured to this movie by it 's title . I mean c'mon .. what true fan of horror wouldn't be intrigued by a title like " Vampires vs . Zombies " ? Images of the " undead " battling each other to the " undeath " danced in my head . I thought to myself .. " this I 've got to see " ! Well .. sorry to say .. " this I wish I hadn't seen " ! This movies title is very misleading to say the least . There was no vampires fighting zombies . In fact , there is no plot ! If you were to ask me what this movie is all about I could honestly tell you I have no idea ! There was no plot ! There was no story ! This movie absolutely makes no sense at all ! At the end of this debacle .. I found myself feeling sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money into this project for they surely have no business sense !  
  The Invisible Man is a fantastic movie from 1933 , a cutting edge film for it 's time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible . Go ahead , take a look at the film , you will be shocked that it was made in 1933 , it was the first true special effects movie . Come 2000 , computer aided special effects seem like child 's play , audiences are not blown away by special effects , instead they are disappointed if they are not done right . The special effects in Hollow Man , the update of the HG Wells story , are OK , but not the biggest problem with this film directed by Paul Verhoeven , who you might remember from Showgirls and Total Recall . Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine , a scientist dabbling in the world of bio-invisibilation ( yeah , I know that 's not a word ) but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the team 's funding . So , as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do , he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation ( yeah , I know , I used that non-word again ) process . The process has dire consequences , no Caine does not die , but instead becomes a horny , violent creature , aka a guy . Now that he 's invisible , Caine stalks a sexy neighbor , a co-worker , former girlfriend Linda ( Elisabeth Shue ) , and the man who took away his funding . Then a funny thing happens , Caine becomes a new supernatural being , " The Thing That Won't Die . " Laughing in the face of all things natural , Caine faces down death and spits in it 's face , as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die , dragging the ending of the movie out . The movie is silly , stupid , and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used , sometimes not . There are neat possibilities in Hollow Man , but of course , not one of them is explored . For a more interesting look at an invisible being , get ready for some good old-fashioned black and white cinema , and check out the 1933 Invisible Man . Kevin Bacon will still be invisible when you come back , probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano .  
  My title above says it all . Let me make it clearer . If you have seen the BBC 's " Planet Earth " , which I am sure most of you have , then you are not gonna like this movie too much . And I own all the discs of " Planet Earth " I had seen the rating for this movie very high , and read good reviews about it . I was excited to check it out . Alas , I went to the theater and the movie started , I saw it was a Disney movie with production companies listing BBC and Discovery . And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear , I recognized them from my DVDs at home of " Planet Earth " . The movie continued and went on and on and on , me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from " Planet Earth " . We were very very disappointed , as I think 90 % of the footage is from " Planet Earth " . I am saying 90 % , because some of the scenes I didn't recognize . I have a feeling that I simply didn't remember them . So finally what this movie really is , is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of " Planet Earth " , with a narration aimed at kids . Yes , the narration is quite kiddish . Let me give you an example . When they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub , the narrator says " The polar cubs are not like human kids . They don't always listen to their mothers " ( I don't remember the exact words , but this is how it is ) So in a nutshell . This is condensed " Planet Earth " for kids !  
  This movie is awful . At the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can't get back . The " twist " ending is very contrived . The character development leading up to this ending is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion . Ninety minutes of preparation - with the premise that the Rob Lowe character will die on Christmas Eve - is explained away in literally ninety seconds of " No we were just tricking you . " Then the Rob Lowe character is not even upset about it ! " I will forgive you if you can forgive me , " is as upset as he gets . If someone took weeks to convince me I was about to die and then said " No , sorry , just fooling you " I would raise some serious hell . I don't feel bad about giving away the spoiler because I might be able to save some of you out there from watching . Please save yourself and DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE .  
  The Education of Little Tree is just not as good as it could have been . Little Tree 's education is about things like the circle of life and how you should look at a star to help you . Whatever happened to the three R 's ? Readin ' ' Ritin ' and ' Rithmetic ? When the idiot back talks the teacher at the boarding school place he starts crying and talking to the sky . Oh my gosh . Sure , the lady was a little harsh , but then James Cromwell 's character comes and takes him away , leaving the audience thinking that Little Tree was absolutely right . He should learn to adapt to new discipline . Those were the times ! Talking to a star is not going to change a thing ! Little Tree needs to learn that his adoring guardians are not always right .  
  This movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel complete . The one thing people have forgotten is the fact that the reason the original won such acclaim , was strictly do to the fact that it was supposed to make you feel incomplete . This movie makes me want to go to the washroom . I am not a negative type of guy , but man the acting in this flick is .. no comment . The plot was a bad reflection of the life of Carlito Brigante and I am sorry to have had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this flick . I still love the original and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my opinion about it .  
  I 'm a big fan of Pacino movies . He 's one of , if not the best , actors of this genre . However , this movie could 've been a whole lot better even though it had a poor cast . All they had to do was tell the story of Carlito Brigante up until he went to jail . Instead it seemed like this was just one of many stories that could be told of Carlito . All or even some of the questions about his past that we wondered about in the original could 've been answered . As far as I 'm concerned , thats the only way you can make this movie . Instead we get this prequel that has almost NONE of the original characters in it , a character that plays a different part from the original ( horrible move ) , and a totally different love interest for Carlito . Don't even get me started with Puffy . No way can I take that cat seriously as a gangsta after watching him dance in all his artists videos . Evertytime that dude opened his mouth I was waiting for him to start dancing . He made me laugh if anything . Mario Van Peeples surprised me with his role . I thought he was gonna give a lackluster performance due to his recent history . He did rather well . He was probably the most " believable " out of the entire cast in my opinion . Jay Hernandez did his best but doesn't have the skills right now in his career to take on this role . I appreciated his energy and his efforts though . Hard to follow up Pacino . The only way you could even have a clue about what kind of person Carlito was , is to watch the original . Otherwise , Carlito looks like a cold blooded killer in one scene then a spineless wimp in another . He was one of the baddest gangstas of his time but you would only see flashes of that in this movie . Maybe this is a pitiful way for Hollywood to try and make a 2nd prequel to cash in on this failure . Wouldn't surprise me . Overall , in my opinion , this movie fell well short or what it could 've been . The only reason I gave it a 3 was because I laughed a lot and Mario Van Peeples earned some respect back with me . A serious director should 've taken this movie and actually put time into the story and turned it into an actual prequel . I 'm extremely disappointed that this movie wasn't taken seriously . They would 've been better off making this into a mini-series on HBO and actually telling the story like the original suggests . At the end of the movie , they had the nerve to suggest that Carlito would have to come back to the city . HEELLO .. thats the part everyone wants to see ! Then again , this is all just my opinion . I can't tell you how to waste your money .  
  Every generation fully believes it is living in the end times . This has been true for thousands of years now . And movies like this feed on this . How did they get the great Orson Welles to narrate this train wreck ? This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon . It tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made , making it obviously dated and kind of silly . The reenactments look like they are out of " Unsolved Mysteries " but without the high production values . People should have been embarrassed to take part in this . In short , the movie is dated , silly , reactionary , and useless . Good if you want a good laugh , but not good enough to actually look for .  
  The Class is a comedy series that portrays a bunch of 27-year-old former class mates . I like the idea of the show . That 's why it saddens me that The Class is not funny , even though it has the obvious potential . It 's not enough corky , just dorky . ( Haha . ) This is due to a slowish tempo and the lack of actually hilarious punch lines . Also some actors have difficulties with timing . Most inventively written characters are the twins Kat and Lina Warbler ( Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh ) but even they seem just a little too square for the good of the show . On the other hand the characters I find most uninteresting are the main character Ethan and the used-to-be - couple Duncan and Nicole . What bothers me with the series is that the only Latino character Aaron is being picked on for his accent ( even though by a non-respectable character , but anyway ) .  
  A young scientist Harry Harrison is continuing his late father 's scientific research into limb regeneration with flying colours , but his interferingly dominate mother and her doctor lover want to sell off the serum . When he finds out , there is an accident involving Harry losing an arm . So , he tries out the serum and what eventuates is a genetically deranged arm that has a mind of its own . Oh we 've seen this oh so many times before , but what lifts this very campy and quite rubbery shonky junk is the performance of movie icons Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed . Actually it 's not a bad flick by Fangoria films ; just there are better ones out there , which are similar in vein . " Servered Ties " simply lacks it own distinctive style . The oddball nature and unpleasant splatter resembled " Re-animator " and even a touch of slapstick stuck out like something from " Evil Dead 2 " . The comic story is truly whacked out with it 's black humour , but it can get melodramatic and a bit in dry in the fun factor . Surprises do crop up , especially the flick 's final outcome . Which is well accepted , as I thought it could have copped out with something more accessible . For a low-budget production the FX makeup can look rigid and very goofy , but there 's some grotesque moments that will make you smile than actually cringe . Even a brush of sexual tension streamlines the story , thanks to Elke Sommer 's sternly juicy performance as the mother . Oliver Reed is quite humorously deadpan in a wicked sense and he pulls it off extremely well . They were both immensely diverting as the couple you loved to hate . Billy Morrisette is delightful in a erratic performance as Harry . Director Damon Santostefano briskly paces the film and orchestrates some stylish scenes of gripping and bamboozling horror . Yeah it 's juvenile and basically silly nonsense , but you got to hand it to it for some undemanding entertainment .  
  I borrowed this movie from library think it might be delightful . How wrong am I ! It is such a bad movie that I have to write something about it . Mira Sorvino is SO bad in the movie , it is very painful to watch the scene with her . She is a pretty girl , but in this movie , She is not seductive at all , but I will have to witness her awkward attempt to seduce almost all the other major characters . It is so ridiculous . And the dialog of the film is so pretentious , and lack the humorous fact that make then acceptable . Totally failure .  
  Julia Roberts obviously makes a concerted effort to shake off her cotton wool Pretty Woman persona with this spurious spousal abuse thriller , but it 's hard to imagine she 'd end up putting in a performance as powerful and convincing ( and oscar winning ) as she did in Erin Brokovich based on the back of this rubbish . And make no bones about it , it 's nothing more than a Julia Roberts vehicle , but unfortunately , her performance is not the most lacklustre thing about it . The plot has all the markings of a late night made-for-cable , and don't be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters are sketched out enough for you to really care . Ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying , without Roberts ' name above the title , I 'm sure it would have totally flopped , deservedly .  
  First some background ; I am English and have lived in London all my life . I have been to many games at ' The Den ' and most other London club grounds . I am familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism and I know just how they act and how they speak . Have to say this is a bad , bad movie . I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic movies I have ever seen . I spent most of the movie cringing with embarrassment . I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out a few things . a ) People just don't talk like that in London in real life ; the filmmakers took the whole slang thing too far and made it sound stupid . Unfortunately hooligan types do exist , but those you see in Green Street are more like parodies . b ) The actor who plays Pete Dunham ( Charlie Hunnam ) unfortunately sounded about as ' English ' or ' Cockney ' as Osama Bin Laden . He 's from up north in Newcastle and I 'm just amazed any of the other actors could keep straight face acting alongside him - how are we supposed to take him seriously . Why they didn't just get someone from East London to play that part is beyond me . I could have done ' a bang up job ' myself , hehe . c ) Mr Frodo . I mean how can I be expected to take seriously Elijah Wood kicking the ass of people twice his size and who are genuinely nasty hooligans . He 'd be dead . Simple as that . Honestly ( as a Brit ) it was hard to watch this film . I 'm pretty sure this film will bomb here in the UK . It may do a little better in the states because the Americans just wont know ( or care ) how inaccurate it is . Please my American and foreign friends , don't believe a word of this nonsense . Yes these firms do exist but it 's all extremely underground and hush hush , and on a vastly smaller scale . The movie only gets a 2 from me because they actually filmed some of it in London . Usually they try to film these things in Cardiff ( Wales ) or something and expect us all not to notice .  
  Green Street , as it was called in the UK , or Hooligans is a bad film . The story is full of fantastical ideas and premises that anyone who lives in England , has been to a football match or knows the first thing about football will spot immediately . My first main gripe with Hooligans is the poor casting of the two main characters . Don't get me wrong , I like Elijah Wood and have a great respect for his work , but despite his best efforts he struggled to pull off this role . The main motivation for his character is anger at the system and anger at betrayal , however he spends much of the film placid and cheery , only displaying his pent up aggression in one brief scene towards the end of the film . This linked with his looks and physique make him a thoroughly unconvincing addition to a gang of football hooligans . At no point during the film was I convinced that a ) he could handle himself in a fight against such thugs and b ) the ' firm ' of thugs would accept such a person into their fold . The other main character is played by Charlie Hunnam . Charlie looks the part , and is fairly convincing as a thug . Unfortunately , being a native of Newcastle Upon Tyne in the North of England , he demonstrates the worst East London accent since Dick Van Dyke tried to go cock-en-y in Marry Poppins . Details such as this probably will not bother an American audience who will be less attuned to regional dialect in the UK , but being from the UK it was a problem I couldn't ignore and it contributed to ruining the movie for me . The supporting cast all gave convincing performances and were well cast , especially the role of Bover . The lad playing this character would have been much more suited to the main role that Charlie played . With a film like this , you have to convince the audience that your characters are plausible , unfortunately , the casting failed . Imagine if you made a film like The Godfather and had Sean Hayes ( Jack ) from Will and Grace playing Michael Corleone 's part . You would not be convinced . The story in Hooligan is also full in implausibilities . I am no football Hooligan , but I am a fantatical football fan . I know how cliquey a group of ' regular ' football supporters can be , as such it deem it impossible for a non-football fan , who is not a fan of the club in question , is not from the area in question and not even of English nationality to be embraced by a ' firm ' who equate to a secret organisation in some severe cases . My final , and biggest , problem with this film , is the way it portrays football hooligans . I take objection to the film 's idea that despite being very violent individuals , hooligans are excused as they live by some sort of code of ethics in their own world and should be admired for being brave and loyal to each other . This is complete rubbish . Football hooligans are complete scum . They take football , the national sport of England and use it as an excuse to terrorise , frighten and intimidate people . They only represent a tiny percentage of football fans but give the whole game and people of this country a bad reputation . They are not brave or loyal , they are cowardly and evil . If the ' GSE ' in this film truly loved their club , West Ham , why would the devote their lives to being a stain on its name . Hooligans are an embarrassment to football and to English society . Football hooligans do for the reputation of football what Hitler did to the reputation of Germans . Although this film tries / intends to show the ' gritty ' side of football violence . It does nothing more than promote it as some kind of excusable activity for extreme fans of the sport . It does not show the poor innocent by-standers at football matches who have their day ruined by some idiot throwing coins / lighters / glass into the crowd . It does not show the innocent home and property owners who have to put up with graffiti and broken windows . It does not show the REAL fans of football clubs who suffer indignity and embarrassment when their teams supporters are banned from travelling to away matches or abroad to European games because the thugs among them ruin it for everyone . If you want to see a good film about football violence , watch the BBC drama ' The Firm ' .  
  I bought this DVD set , sight unseen , and wish I hadn't . The script needed some serious rewriting as it seems to be completely devoid of any feeling and pales in comparison to the book . The lighting is horrid , very unpolished , but if it was just that I could overlook it . The script doesn't focus enough on the characters .. there is hardly an introduction to various characters making it a tad difficult to distinguish who is who ( especially in the planes-no idea who dies when ) . I have long felt that the key to a good film is in getting the audience to care about the characters ; if you don't have that you don't have anything . There was no focus on the characters at all-you never got to know them-who they were , what they liked .. what made them do the things that they do . The series is 5 hours long and split up into 6 parts .. I bet you are wondering what they did with all this time if they didn't detail the characters-they put a lot of filler in it .. I will say at least an entire hour is spent watching them land and take off in their planes LOL ( I mean do we really need to see that over and over again ? ) . I would have given this a much higher rating had they just improved our knowledge of the characters .  
  At first glance this documentary / fiction / cartoon is quite entertaining and thought provoking . Of course , when something provokes thought , it can then be scrutinized . The reality is this movie combines metaphysics with innuendo and baseless conclusions . The link that " What the Bleep .. " would have you see between science and spirituality is , in fact , not rooted in science at all . The Transcendental Meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a given area , Washington D.C. in this case . In reality the HRA ( Homicides , Rapes , and Assaults ) crime rate was about 30 % higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 19881992 . There was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study . In fact , each and every claim that links metaphysics to science can and has been debunked . My conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke . Either way , I suggest that you do not waste your time . If you are looking for a long winded movie about science that could provoke thoughts , you might consider Mindwalk ( 1990 ) .  
  If you want to see intelligent , philosophical discussion of human possibility and potential , watch " Waking Life , " which is brilliant . " What the # $ * ! Do We Know " is all over the place in its focus , poorly directed , poorly written , poorly acted , utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying . It wasn't thought-provoking or entertaining in the slightest . The inclusion of that rambling freak " Ramtha " in this film is reason enough to avoid it . Isn't it strange how the filmmakers choose to look over the fact that this woman worships some 2,000 year old Atlantian god or something ? What a flake that old chick is , and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was . The people responsible for this film should not be allowed to make another movie ever again .  
  If you 're a layman interested in quantum theory and string theory , read " The Elegant Universe " by Brian Greene of Columbia University , and " The Universe in a Nutshell " by Stephen Hawking of Cambridge . Recipe for # $ * ! : 3 parts bombastic New Age pontificator , 2 parts pseudoscientist , 2 parts real scientist Mix together until ingredients are indistinguishable from each other and spread on celluloid thin enough that there is no discernible substance . Serving suggestion : barf bags .  
  I must pat myself on the back for watching this movie all the way through because it truly was painful . An incapable painter becomes a fully capable hit-man ? This movie was rife with absurdities of which if I mentioned them all I would be giving away the movie . Norm Peterson aka George Wendt must really be in a rut to have agreed to do this movie . The acting was deplorable and the story was even worse . As a sane minded and rational individual , I could not understand where the writer came from nor where he was going with this movie . There was ineptness on the part of every main character , there was a string of hapless and ridiculous events , then the movie ended . One absurd act after another with dialogue doesn't make a movie , it only makes a talkative train wreck .  
  You can't imagine how I looked forward to King of the Ants . As a massive Gordon fan , I awaited the European premiere with wicked anticipation . especially since I loved Dagon - Gordon 's last achievement - so much . King of the Ants premiered here in my country and it was Gordon himself who came to present it . Unfortunately , I couldn't go and congratulate him for it afterwards . King of the Ants is his most uninspired and mediocre film to date . Really , the quality level never surpassed ordinary TV-thriller standards . The plot outline is terribly routine and with the exception of a few poor scenes , the typical Gordon-touch is never recognized . On top of that , the already weak script has more holes than a Swiss bowl of cheese ! It involves a young wannabe-crook who 's hired to commit a murder . So he does . and of course they 're not paying him . and of course he falls in love with the victim 's wife . and of course he avenges himself .. Only the sequences in which the guy descents in a spiral of madness are worth a mention and they 're the only ones reminding you of the fact you 're still watching a Stuart Gordon film . The acting performances are below average with McCenna as the heroic lowlife , George ` Norm Peterson ' Wendt as the chubby bastard and Kari Wuhrer as the good-hearted sex bomb . Extremely illogical things happen constantly and the dullness of the story becomes irritating very quickly , while the make-up effects aren't enough to even satisfy amateur-horror fans . I read a few other comments on King of the Ants , claiming it 's Gordon 's best since it finally is a thought-provoking and mature film . Well , if that 's the case . I rather stay immature and give Re-Animator another viewing , thank you very much . Oh well , I guess every good director runs out of steam and inspiration eventually . too bad it also overcame Stuart Gordon .  
  This was a crappy movie , with a whole lotta non-sense and too many loose-ends to count . I only watched this movie because one of my favorite actors ( Ron Livingston ) made a cameo in it , and I continued watching it because as a girl , I love any movie that includes male nudity for a change . Later , I found myself wondering just how much more ridiculous the storyline could get , and each time it got .. more .. ridiculous . Sean Crawley ( good-looking Chris L . McKenna , whom I 've never seen before - but LOVED his little nude scene ) is making ends meet as a painter , when he meets electrician Duke Wayne ( George Wendt from " Cheers " ) . Thinking he 's getting more work from Duke , Sean agrees to meet contractor Ray Matthews ( Daniel Baldwin , playing a stereotypically evil guy ) . Ray is being investigated by a City Hall accountant ( Ron Livingston in a cameo , who I 've been in love with from " Office Space " up to " Sex & the City " ) . Ray end up offering the apparently desperate-for - cash Sean $ 13k to kill the accountant , and Sean accepts the job . Sean stalks out the accountant , whose wife ( Kari Wuhrer ) he finds himself attracted to , completes the hit , and leaves - taking the file of information against Ray with him . Sean quickly learns he was being used , that Ray never intended to pay him , and Sean uses the file as leverage to get his money . Up to this point , it 's a descent flick .. generally worth watching . But as soon as Ray , Duke and their crew kidnap Sean to muscle the information about the file out of him , it just got dumber and dumber ( and still DUMBER .. ) , until finally it seemed like the film 's writer , Charlie Higson , had snapped out of a 10-day writing hangover and realized he needed to desperately figure out how to wrap up the series of implausible messes he created before a deadline or something . Without simply detailing the movie , let 's just say that in every-single-scene you watch after the kidnapping , you find yourself gasping " what the f * K ! , " baffled by the ongoing nonsense as Sean follows a fairly graphic and gross path towards redemption . In the end , so many loose-ends are left in the movie , that you begin to regret that you even watched it . This is a movie that you should only watch after it hits cable , and you should have enough beer and friends around to mock the film to it 's full value . It 's supposed to be a psychological thriller , and McKenna is a decent actor , but it 's hard to give yourself to the movie when you have " Norm " from " Cheers " and a Baldwin brother doing the dirty work , and a kidnapping strategy that really makes no damned sense . Guys will love the violence , blood and guts scenes , and the absolutely unnecessary sex scenes and boob shots . Girls will enjoy handsome Sean 's gratuitous crotch shot in a mainstream movie , when its almost always the girls that get stripped down in a movie . Personally , I hate that the only actor worth watching for more than his looks ( Ron Livingston ) is only in the first one-third of the movie .  
  I sometimes enjoy really lousy movies .. those that occasionally result when people ( even talented people ) get together with good intentions to produce a movie and for whatever reason it turns out to be a disaster . Movies like " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " , " Plan 9 from Outer Space " , " Manos-Hands of Fate " , and " Heavens Gate " , etc . So , when I heard that this movie , " Rachel 's Attic " , was considered by many people to be the single worst film of the decade , naturally I just HAD to see it . Boy , do I regret that decision . This movie is beyond bad .. it is SO bad that it is not even as enjoyable as the usual bad movie . The acting , filming , script , etc . are even worse than a low budget porno film : the sound is utterly horrible , the " plot " is completely incomprehensible , the " acting " is laughable .. it is a complete waste of everyone 's time and money . At least the porno film has porno to break up the monotony , while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy squeezing a rotten apple , and a " mad hatter 's " tea party . The lighting is non-existent .. many " scenes " take place in semi or complete darkness , which is probably just as well . The " writer-director " ( I use the terms loosely ) , David Tybor , tries to get kinky with bondage scenes .. but the results would be laughable , if they weren't so pathetic . There is some nudity , but it is of such abysmal quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressant . I could go on forever and not do justice to all the flaws and shortcomings of this truly awful waste of film . For the love of god , avoid this train wreck . I know that despite ( or perhaps because of ) my negative comments , you may still be tempted to see if this piece of trash is really as bad as I claim it to be .. but trust me on this .. it 's even worse than I have said , and you will absolutely , positively regret the experience ( and expense , if you waste your money on a purchase or rental ) .  
  There are bad movies , terrible movies even boring movies .. I can watch most and put up until the end , not this time . Avoid this like the plague , annoying music throughout , terrible editing , no comedy , its tackier than a novelty mug .. My missus wanted to watch this thinking it would be Legally Blonde material or something kind of watchable , but never better than average , chick flick . Its the first time she was begging me to push the stop button . The Girls , well , they were not great to start with ( Denise done OK in Starship Troopers and Wild things ) but you have sank to the gravel . I feel like a mug having spent 30 minutes on this .. Pamela Anderson is almost unrecognisable after much construction work to her face . Please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells ranting at the utter mince that is on your screen .  
  Yep , lots of shouting , screaming , cheering , arguing , celebrating , fist clinching , high fiving & fighting . You have a general idea as to why , but can never be 100 % certain . A naval knowledge would be an advantage for the finer points , but then you 'd probably spot the many flaws . Not an awful film & Hackman & Washington are their usual brilliant , but the plot was one you could peg pretty early on . I 'm still waiting to see a submarine film where people get on with each other & don't argue , but then you probably wouldn't have a film . 4/10  
  I mean seriously what group would sing about a crazy car ? So what if their ten , It 's way too immature for a little kid to sing about " being my women " I mean seriously ! The name is pretty corny too , naked brothers ? just because they take off their pants ? HOW CREATIVE.I don't get why they need a TV show I mean most artist don't really need a TV show about themselves , especially the naked brothers band . Heck how many of them are in the freaking group . And seriously whats with the movie ? Jeez Nick use to be the hightlight of my years growing up but seriously The naked brother band ? SO many parents would not let their kids watch this especially with the name the Naked Brother 's band , its a stupid , uncreative show that should not be aired onto TV .  
  I used to LOVE this movie as a kid but , seeing it again 20 + years later , it actually sucks . Up The Academy might have been ahead of it 's time back in 1980 , but it has almost nothing to offer today ! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes hold-up much better today than this steaming dogpile . No T & A . No great jokes except for the one-liners we 've all heard a million times by now . I recently bought the DVD in hopes that it would be the gem I remembered it being . Well , I was WAY off ! The soundtrack had only 2-3 widely-recognizable hits ( not the smash compilation others had mentioned ) and the frequent voice-overs were terrible . The only thing that was interesting , to me , was predicting what the character 's lines were before they said them . Yep , I watched this movie that much back then ! The only reason I am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten , sorry to say . : (  
  When I saw this " documentary " , I was disappointed to see Serbian Propaganda in action once again . Even though Serbia and its nationalist politics is main reason of Yugoslavian breakup , it is not mentioned in this " documentary " , which is made by Bogdanovich whose name tells us that he is Serbian and his movie that he is far from being objective . It is one in the set of lies pushed by Milosevic regime . Everyone else is guilty only Serbians were right and victims , even though most of the War Criminals tried in Hague are Serbs , even though Serbs are one who have committed genocide against Bosnians , and attacked Slovenia , Croatia , and Bosnia all independent nations recognized by the UN . Breakup of Yugoslavia was not avoidable because Serbians did not want to release the grip their nationalism has put on Federal Yugoslav government , so SLovenia , Croatia , Macedonia , and Bosnia were forced to become independent nations in order to protect their interests . If you are interested in an objective documentary about breakup of Yugoslavia , and fact led documentary this is not it . You should watch " Yugoslavia : Death of a Nation " , Made by Discovery channel and BBC .  
  The only thing I remember about this movie are two things : first , as a twelve year old , even I thought it stunk . Second , it was so bad that when Mad magazine did a parody of it , they quit after the first page , and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed it . If you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period , try Animal House . It 's so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art . Another good selection would be Caddyshack , the classic with the late Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray before he became annoyingly charming , with great lines like greens keeper Carl Spackler 's " Correct me if I 'm wrong Sandy , but if I kill all the golfers they 'll lock me up and throw away the key . "  
  There isn't more I can say that saying this film was awful . The whole Chineseness is awakened in your being because of the ancestors was a hard sell . But telling the audience that every Chinese knows Chinese history without even studying it just laughable . That is like saying every American knows American history without studying or every Filipino , etc , etc . It just isn't believable . The story is flat out hideous . It talked about Shin being from a Monastery in China - later identifying it from Bejing . However , the early sequences of the film show the map focusing in on Mongolia . I know the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas like Mongolia for its own , granted . But its a distinct nation and it even labels " Mongolia " on the map . Did Disney Studios fail 5th Grade Geography ? The relationship between Wendy and Shin is superficial at best , and yet she somehow feels connected to him . Her training is just cheesy as well . And , lets cut to the chase : everything about this film is bad . Its bad enough to laugh at and cry over . The Taekwondo action was over played and unrealistic in many instances . The evil eyes thing was cheesy . However , the left out ending would have been the only descent thing about it . They should have left the evil eyes ending in it . But instead somehow evil is defeated . Yey ! Overall , not worth the time of the dog in the film . Brenda Song should get on with another studio . " F "  
  I thought the film was good in parts . the start was exciting . the first 30 minutes of the film were good . the camera angles in the first 30 minutes were strange and i did not like it coz the were they not covering the actors entirely . i think the last 25 minutes of the film were really not that great from which we expect a lot in case of such films . the dialoques did not make sense and i don't think they were very witty . i felt as if they were trying to copy films like phonebooth in terms of dialogues , but failed miserably . it seemed as if they many of the scenes between the actors were put for sake of it and did not make any sense to the story . the entire film features only law and caine . i don't think it was a waste of time , its an OK film , but not gr8  
  you can tell they spent 5 $ making this . it is a waste of your time .. ugh .. there is not anything remotely good about this movie .. .. i don't know why i kept watching it .. the chick is not hot . horrid acting .. you could do anything and its a better use of your time .. like watching TV playing shitty video games .. i feel robbed . simply robbed .. of my time . i have never made a review for a movie before as you can probably tell but this movie i felt like i needed to save the poor souls that are about to watch it and looking on IMDb before to see if its decent and looking at the comments . - there was no action - - no hot chicks - - no budget - - shitty acting - it screams bad movie . * the WHOLE movie is in a room . *  
  Before watching this film , I could already tell it was a complete copy of Saw ( complete with the shack-like place they were in and the black guy wanting someone to break his hand to get out of the cuffs ) . MJH 's name on a movie would typically turn me away ( ugh , can we say GROSS ? ! ) , but I still wanted to give it a try . Starting out , I was a bit interested . The acting is absolutely horrible and I found myself laughing at almost each reaction from the characters ( especially the man that played " Sulley " ) . MJH was even worst , but I continued to watch . However , the ending was the biggest joke of them all ! I seriously sat in shock thinking " THAT was the ending ? ! Is this a comedy ? ! " . I thought this pile of crap was funnier than the " Scary Movie " spoofs and that is REALLY saying something !  
  " Phantasm " of 1979 was a highly atmospheric , creepy , scary and very original Horror flick , and , in one word , cult . The first sequel of 1988 was gory , witty , action-packed and highly entertaining . After the first sequel however , " Phantasm " creator Don Coscarelly apparently lacked new ideas . " Phantasm II - Lord Of The Dead " of 1994 is certainly not a complete failure , it even is quite entertaining , but there is no more originality , and the desperate attempts to bring in something new , are at times tiresome , which makes it quite disappointing in comparison to its predecessors . - SPOILERS - Quite in the beginning , we are introduced the secret behind the mysterious sentinel spheres ( the brain-sucking flying silver balls ) is unraveled . Thenceforward , a number of unnecessary and annoying new characters ( such as Tim , a " Home Alone " - style little kid who happens to be great at shooting , an Rocky , a tough and super-cool nunchaku-swinging black chick with a crew cut ) are introduced . The film also has its qualities - Reggie Bannister is again very cool as the pony-tailed , guitar playing Reggie . Angus Scrimm is still quite creepy as the Tall Man , but the fact that the Tall Man talks a lot more in this film , makes him loose some of his creepiness . The character of Mike is played by A . Michael Baldwin again ( he had been replaced by James LeGros in Part 2 ) , which , in my opinion , doesn't make much of a difference . The gore also keeps the film interesting enough to watch , but it is still a disappointment , especially because the attempts to make up for the lack of ideas get annoying quite quickly . All things considered , " Phantasm II " is an acceptable time-waster , but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors . Fans of the first two " Phantasm " films can give it a try , but I recommend not to set your expectations too high .  
  The competition for the worst Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is stiff . I 've only seen perhaps eight of them , but Comet over Broadway is the worst so far . The very best thing about it is that it 's short . Oh , and the Orry-Kelly gowns ( of course ) are fine . James Wong Howe 's cinematography is not . Kay Francis throughout looks fat-faced and far less attractive than she normally does . Minna Gombell whom I don't know otherwise is good as a semi-tough " burlesque " dancer ( it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque ) . The closing shot - Kay Francis and her child ( when did the child learn that Kay Francis was her mother ? Did I doze off ? ) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous . The whole film is so cheap , so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it : Warner Bros tossing garbage to dolts who don't know , in Warner Bros ' cynical estimation of them , that what they 're getting is garbage .  
  Some unrealistic movie spoilers included . From real life experiences , this movie continued to disappoint from the very beginning . I 'm currently deployed on my second tour to Iraq as an infantry man . This film has nothing near what would happen in real life occurrences . From the very start to name a few : the bomb cart , the EOD elements rolling out solo with no escorts , the EOD staff sergeant sneaking of VBC , having sleeves rolled the entire time in ACUs , to where i had to call it quits on my 2 dollar haji copy , the sniper scene . The list would continue , however , it is unnecessary to list things wrong happening with a time span of 2 minutes before more things were incorrect ; and the point was made . This movie is for people and critics to watch that have no understanding or experience with deployments or the military . People with military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed with the inaccuracy .  
  This flick was a blow to me . I guess little girls should aspire to be nothing more than swimsuit models , home makers or mistresses , since that seems to be all they 'll ever be portrayed as anyway . It is truly saddening to see an artist 's work and life being so unjustly misinterpretated . Inconcievably ( or perhaps it should have been expected ) , Artemisia 's entire character and all that she stands for , had been reduced to a standard Hollywood , female character ; a pitiful , physically flawless , helpless little creature , displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being mutilated here . Sadder yet , was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film , and reality . To portray the artist as someone in love with her real-life rapist , someone whom she in reality accused of raping her even when under torture , just plain pisses me off . If the director had nothing more substantial to say she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person .  
  What did the director think ? Everybody who has read the biography of Artemisia is left impressed by her guts to face a public rape trial in Renaissance times and even suffer torture in order to show that Tassi was guilty . That fact shows the real independence and emancipation - in her most terrible hour she stands her MAN . Why do movies depicting Renaissance have to be so clinically beautiful and romantic , are we afraid to see the gritty side of life or has the Hollywood happy-happy-mood won ? While I would always defend a director 's freedom to create his own reality in a movie I cannot make sense of turning Artimisia 's life story on its head . Very disappointing choice by the makers of this film .  
  Almost in the same league as Yonfan 's rather atrocious Color Blossoms , Spider Lillies drives the point home that you can make cutting edge cinema without the edge , or much in the way of cutting . It 's a Taiwanese film , which in this day and age is becoming a novelty at an alarming pace , but more than that tidbit , we can find very little in the way of the noteworthy here . You should know that ostensibly Spider Lillies is also a lesbian-themed story , but in every aspect this is nothing but a plastic ploy to lure in the easily seduced and gullible . In several ways we have here a repeat of fellow recent Taiwan release Eternal Summer . Then it was gay men getting the shortchange treatment , now we have the same thing with women . Zero Chou presents , for your non-existent edification , a tale likely to titillate at most a fifteen year old . They managed some of the art house stance , but in the end this results in a most inane , simply uninteresting foray . The Hong Kong angle comes in the form of Isabella Leung ( Bug Me Not , Isabella , Diary ) , here sporting her most butch look yet . Although somewhat likable in her previous jobs , Isabella in Spider Lillies is listless and lacking in most departments . Either her heart wasn't into it or the whole lesbian drama pitch didn't quite appeal to her sensibilities . She does a Taipei tattoo artist who 's shy , reclusive and in charge of a mentally challenged younger brother , played by John Shen , who thankfully grants the movie its only thespian-related redeeming feature . Isabella 's character , oddly named Takeko but supposedly hailing from Hong Kong , soon hooks up with disaffected youth Jade ( Rainie Yang from fondly-recalled Meteor Garden ) . The latter lives with her grandmother and has a whole list of grievances due to being left behind by her parents and life in general . Sure , the grandmother component works well and is touching , but otherwise Jade as a protagonist is just as unmoving as her counterpart Takeko . The two women share a past and lots of inadequately covered angst , with Jade working as a webcam girl while Takeko keeps her father 's legacy alive with a unique tattoo of a spider lilly emblazoned on her arm . Jade also wants to acquire this very design , which leads to Takeko exploring internal feelings of the issue via flashbacks and rather minimal discourse with the spunky Jade . Well , if there 's little discourse to write the homebase about , is at least the intercourse memorable ? In a word , no . They kiss and feign doing the nasty close to the end , but just as Eternal Summer reminded us not long ago , there 's a gulf measured in lightyears between showing sexual content and making ticket buyers think they 're about to see sexual content . This cynical expectation-building seals Spider Lillies ' fate . With a weak story , ho-hum acting and an overall dearth of relics to take away from the theater with you , this one kind of makes Color Blossoms look good , come to think of it . At least there we got a bit of Teresa Cheung 's mammaries . No , Spider Lillies is no AV masterpiece and should be stricken from the playlist of even the most mundane and timid GLB movie festival . Amazingly for a pseudo-indie release , not even the soundtrack and cinematography produce moments of inspiration . That 's just as well , since it makes passing on Spider Lillies much easier . Believe you us , avoid it and you won't be missing out on anything good . Rating : * *  
  I am usually disappointed by network movies . Even flix that attract big name actors are usually ruined by the TV people . However , this one is the worst of the worst . The screenplay is weak and the acting , especially that of Tracey Pollan is abominable . I 've trudged off to see my kids'high school plays and been treated to better acting . Pollan acts as if she is reading the script as she speaks . When she tries to express fear , anger or grief , it 's extremely hollow . Because of the overall quality of the production I found it difficult to take it seriously . If you decide to brave this one just be prepared for a big disappointment . Scary things won't scare you , sad things won't make you sad , romance won't make you feel warm and fuzzy and you will likely be as anxious as I was to see the end arrive . " First to die " says a lot about this movie .  
  I actually didn't mind the Geico commercials the first 50 of so times I saw them and even found them to be a bit wry and amusing , BUT SERIOUSLY ! This is the BEST thing that these people could come up with ? ! ? This show sucks ! It is bland and feels like watching an episode of " The Office " with the characters disguised as cavemen ( I know a lot of you will hate me for saying that but " The Office " just does not do it for me ) . Okay , I get it : we have the poor slob just trying to keep his nose clean and he has a crappy boss who hates him ; the pseudo-intellectual who really just has a barely-functioning intellect ; and the dopey one who just wants to be accepted , but SO WHAT ! I have worked with these people and found them just as annoying in real life as I do on TV .. why would I want to waste another 1/336th of my week watching more of those type nominates ? ! ? Please call your parents and ask them if they dropped you on your head if after thinking about it , you still delude yourself into believing that this is entertainment .  
  Admittedly , I watched this piece with already VERY low expectations . Dieter Bohlen is a rather untalented composer parvenu whose lack of talent is only surpassed by the size of his ego . This was the first cartoon movie that I watched that was 100 per cent humor free . It is rude , offensive , redneck and blatantly anti - women . As such , it is a creation befitting Bohlen , but the average viewer will be rather put off by it . No wonder that it was never shown in a cinema theater : It would 've bombed BIG time ! Not even the expense of 6.5 MegaEuros were able to save this utter piece of crap . Save your time .. and money !  
  I am a great fan of the Batman comics and I became disappointed when I could no longer find Batman : The Animated Series on TV anymore . I was excited to learn that there was going to be a new Batman cartoon on TV . I watched the first episode the day it premiered and I was very disappointed . First of all , the animation is very poor . It looks like a cheap , crappy Japanese anime . Then again , just about every modern-day cartoon is like that . The character designs are even worse . Batman looks more like Birdman , Catwoman looks more like Chihuahuawoman , Bane looks more like a red version of the Hulk , the Penguin is a Kung-Fu master , Mr . Freeze is some undead thing with an iceberg on his head , and the Riddler is a Gothic Marilyn Manson look-alike ( which is funny because I don't expect people who are obsessed with riddles and puzzles to be Gothic ) . The worst character design is that of the Joker . They turned him into a monkey / demented Bob Marley / Kung-Fu fighter ! The Joker is supposed to be Batman 's deadliest enemy , but in this show he hardly poses a threat because his crimes are so stupid and pointless . In one episode his plan was to put his Joker venom in dog food ! Oh , how evil ! Batman is a fascinating and complex character because he is haunted by the deaths of his parents , which is why he fights crime . This version of Batman doesn't seem haunted by his parents ' deaths and is not interesting at all . He 's also not a detective , just a fighter . If there 's an enemy he can't defeat , he won't study the enemy to find out their weak points like a detective would , he 'll just build a giant fighting robot to defeat them . A lot of times this show doesn't even feel like a Batman show , just another brainless anime that 's nothing but pointless fighting . What I hate the most about this show is what they did to the villains . They 've taken away everything that makes them likable and relatable and turned them into stereotypical evil bad guys . Man-Bat is the biggest example . In the comics , he 's a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness . When experimenting on himself , he accidentally transforms himself into a giant bat creature . In this show , he 's a mad scientist who wants to purposely transform himself into a giant bat creature for no apparent reason . Just about all the villains are like that ; none of them , with the exception of about one or two , have an actual motive for their crimes . The worst characterization is that of Mr . Freeze . In the comics , Freeze was a just a mad scientist until the genius writer Paul Dini wrote the BTAS episode " Heart of Ice " , which gave Freeze a new origin that made him a more tragic , three-dimensional , and likable villain . The episode was so popular that fans accepted it as his actual origin and it was even used in the comics as his origin . Even that crappy movie Batman & Robin used it as his origin . In this show , he 's a petty jewel thief before becoming Mr . Freeze . After becoming Mr . Freeze , guess what ? He 's STILL a petty jewel thief ! Great origin . No wonder they used it over the one Dini created . As a Batman fan , I don't dislike this show just because it isn't like the comics because I also liked BTAS , the Batman cartoons that came after it , Tim Burton 's Batman films , and obviously , the superb Christopher Nolan Batman films . None of them were 100 % loyal to the comics , but they were still very good . The problem with this show is not that it 's not exactly like the comics or BTAS , it 's that it lacks any sort of depth that makes other Batman media so popular . I 've given this show so many chances , but the more I watch , the more I find that disappoints me . I miss the good old days back when Batman cartoons were something everyone could enjoy .  
  This is a made-for-TV and rather needless Sci-fi Channel retelling of the Beowulf story , especially after the recent 2005 film " Beowulf and Grendel " . This movie doesn't really get into Beowulf 's story , but just takes us through his battle against the ravenous beast known as Grendel as it leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and turmoil while the powerful viking warrior , Beowulf is called upon to rid them of the monster 's rampage . If this is successfully accomplished , the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it at bay . After a few failed attempts , the creature is slain , but it 's angry and vengeful mother soon attacks , leaving it up to Beowulf to , again , lend his mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat it . " Grendel " looks like it was shot on a tiny budget and the CG effects are terrible . Like I said , this movie is absolutely needless .  
  The original " les visiteurs " was original , hilarious , interesting , balanced and near perfect . LV2 must be a candidate for " Worst first sequel to a really good film " . In LV2 everyone keeps shouting , when a gag doesn't work first it 's repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny . LV2 is a horrible parody of LV1 , except of course that a parody should be inventive . If you loved LV1 just don't see this film , just see LV1 again !  
  This movie is not only a very bad movie , with awful actors - or presumed actors - , a bored direction and a story unattractive , it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent " giallio " " Torso " , directed by Sergio Martino in 1973 ( two years before ) , one of the most celebrated psycho-thrillers of Italian cinema and a cult-movie around the world . In " La Sanguinusa conduce la danza " , the director replays the bed scene between the black girl and the white girl , with an peeping-tom watching from a window of the bedroom . Naturally , the scene in Rizzo 's movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in Martino 's film . To put another black girl , another white girl and another peeping-tom replaying the scene is simply the most appropriate way of prove that Rizzo 's movie has no ideas , no originality , no taste , and nothing at all . I think that such things are an offense to spectator .  
  SWEET SIXTEEN ( 1983 ) * / * 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins , Susan Strasberg , Aleisa Shirley , Patrick Macnee , Dana Kimmell Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off . The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell . The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk . These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa 's sixteenth birthday party . This below average slasher isn't too memorable . It has a made for TV feel , without much score besides the title character 's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout . Lines like " the killer will turn us into coleslaw . " Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays . Marci calls Melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship . Apparently Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up . This movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her . The social commentary on Indians wasn't developed enough to be taken seriously . I am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets . Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt 's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but I feel failed to deliver . But on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow .  
  Early film directed by D.W. Griffith ; it features a gloriously happy King ( Arthur V . Johnson ) and his Queen ( Marion Leonard ) - but , wait ! When the King leaves the scene , his Queen makes music with the palace 's Minstrel ( Henry B . Walthall ) . When the King discovers the lovers , he decides to enact a horrific Edgar Allen Poe-type revenge . It 's difficult to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them ; although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy ( the lovers ) and quiet ( the cement mixers ) . The sets make " The Sealed Room " look very staged . The performances are okay , and the story is easy to follow . * The Sealed Room ( 9/2/09 ) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V . Johnson , Henry B . Walthall , Marion Leonard  
  I watched this film in youth group , where my otherwise intuitive youth leader and his wife squeed over it . Then some adult couple at a church-related Christmas party misled themselves into giving a copy of this movie to every single family in attendance , and now my household is stuck with the film ( though it thankfully still remains in its shrinkwrap ) . I cried bitter tears over these sad events , and here 's why : First off : this film has good intentions , especially if you 're a Christian like me . This movie is trying to show that you should put your faith in God and that it 'll make your life better . Not so bad , right ? Eh . It turns out a be a problem-a big one . This movie was made by a church , so of course every single issue has to be dealt with as tastefully for Christians as possible . It is all black-and-white , no gray areas . God 's grace and will in this movie is a predictable thing , and it comes instantly to all those who do His bidding . This is not the God I know . This is not the Christian life I am familiar with . The God I believe in is a powerful and trustworthy God , but He is not one that grants my every wish . I follow Him as best I can , though the going is often hard ; yet the football team in this movie finds their humility and self-control a lot easier than anyone should EVER find it . I cannot relate to cardboard cutouts who flip from bad-side to good-side in the course of a few structured movie scenes . And when I DO follow His commandments as laid out in the Bible , I certainly don't find myself showered in blessing as these characters do . The largest of my immediate rewards is knowing that I have done the right thing ; everything else comes with long , messy , arduous work . But take the example this movie sets : Grant Taylor coaches the football team at Shiloh Christian school , which has had 6 losing seasons in a row . He may lose his job over it , and he and his wife are low on money as it is . They want a baby , but the doctor tells him he is sterile . Oh , and his car doesn't work . And the boys on his football team are disrespectful to their parents , whiny after their million losses , and bad at kicking field goals . This is sure one rundown community here . But wait , Grant Taylor decides he 's going to trust in God for everything ! And he passes on his faith to his team . So far , so good . Not for long . As they begin to obey , blessing literally POUR in on them . Suddenly the students stop disrespecting their parents ; the school has a big " revival " ; the team starts winning EVERY game ; they even win the grand championship against the hardest team in the league ! Coach Taylor 's job is reassured ; the school gets him a shiny new truck as a present ( which , by the way , is the epitome of shallow , fair-weather employers ) ; he gets a raise ; his wife ( get this ) even gets pregnant from his sterile sperm ! And that skinny kid manages to kick his first darn field goal right when it really matters ! Wowzers , woot , yay , praise the Lord , etcetera , etcetera ! .. Yipe . Just YIPE . Nobody in my church has ever experienced Christ in a such a cut-and-dry manner . Yes , there have been miracles aplenty in my family , as well as gifts and creature comforts , and I attribute them to God 's grace and lovingkindness . But God isn't some faucet tap that you turn on and off by being good or bad ! He is by and large a mystery ; His gifts come unexpectedly , often when you think you don't need them but you really do . It 's a long , hard slog to the road of fulfillment , and things NEVER turn out the way you thought they would . This movie has good intentions . But because of its supreme shallowness and total escapism , it tanks tremendously to a 1/10 . The bad acting and sports movie clichés seem to be mere pimples next to the leprous falsehoods that this movie inadvertently pushes . To all you future churches planning to make a movie : don't be afraid to show REAL life , even you have to add some inconvenient truths into the mix . However much the baser populace is wowed by this cotton candy treat , nobody has learned anything substantial from it . Give us the meat , the bones , the REAL stuff ! True life applies to everyone , not just Christians , and that 's one aspect " Facing the Giants " didn't manage to grasp .  
  I had no real expectations going into this movie and I 'm glad . Even if I had expected it to be bad I would have been disappointed . Where to start ? First , I think 15 % of the movie consisted of stock footage of stationary scarecrows in a dark jungle-field . I get it . There 's scarecrows . I think the title " Scarecrows " was sufficient . Second , not a damn thing is ever explained regarding the scarecrows and paranormal occurrences . There 's too many times where I was left going WTF ? Third , the movie takes itself seriously . I 'm all for a B-movie with buckets of blood , screaming women , and senseless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or ancient curse . But those movies often know they 're B-movies and even flaunt it , like Dead Snow ( hilarious Scandanavian zombie flick ) or Evil Dead 2 . But this movie seems oblivious to its crapdom . Finally , there should of been more blood and / or nudity . Yea , I said it . If you 're going to have a crap horror movie , make with the killing . And if you 're going to have one hot and one semi-hot girl , one of them needs to show some side-boob at a minimum . So , like the summary says , skip " Scarecrows " and just poke yourself in the eye . You 'll thank me .  
  I was looking forward to this ride , and was horribly disappointed . And I am very easily amused at roller coaster and amusement park rides . The roller coaster part was just okay - and that was all of about 30 seconds of a 90 second ride . It was visually dull and poorly executed . It was trying desperately to be like a mixture of the far superior Indiana Jones and Space Mountain rides and Disneyland , and failed in every aspect . It was not thrilling or exciting in the least .  
  I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring Hip Hop , but was disappointed on many levels . First of all , the story is so badly recycled as to make it almost unbearable . Second , the setting , acting and story are not very authentic or believable . Third , there are a lot more good black actors to choose from than these standard picks . How about some originality ? Third , there were very few Hip Hop songs played in entirity - if any . None seemd really central . Overall , film was a great disappointment , but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the film worthwhile .  
  I 'm not going to approach and critique the theories of RAW . I mean , this is a site about movies and whether the movie delivers or is well-made , and not a site debating philosophy . Having said that , this video really blows . It 's one talking-head shot of RAW after another . Some of it is archival video , so you can see how he has aged over the years , and that 's pretty cool . But , otherwise , the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous . It 's a strange comparison , but I kept thinking of the Sunday afternoon when I watched some of the Barbra Streisand star vehicle * Funny Lady * ( another really bad movie ) . After a while , I was so OD 'd on Barbra , I kept wishing there would be one scene that she wouldn't appear in : you know , a " meanwhile , other characters in the movie were up to something else .. " moment . But it was all about Barbra . Well this video is RAW 's * Funny Lady * . So , if your idea of a good time is to look at multiple takes and angles of the face of RAW while he prattles on with his theories , assembled in a lame structure that doesn't add any interest or insight , then be my guest . For me , I couldn't take it after 20 minutes .  
  Another turgid action / adventure flick from the Quinn Martin Productions factory . Roy Thinnes plays undercover agent Diamond Head ( Mr . Head , to you ) , working for his G-Man handler " Aunt Mary " , looking for " Tree " , who 's on a mission to .. well , just watch the movie . This one deserved and got the full MST3K sendup . As the boys and various reviewers have pointed out , the movie " Fargo " had more Hawaiian locations than this film . Apparently shot on a puny budget , this movie highlights Hawaii 's broken-down dive shops , gas stations , and cheapo hotels . Zulu - later to star as Kono in Hawaii-Five-O - appears as Thinnes ' lumpy , inept sidekick , while France Nguyen models the Jenny Craig diet gone horribly wrong . Others sharing the flickering screen include a drunken Richard Harris knockoff , a George Takai imitator , a not-so-smart hit-man with sprayed-on Sansabelt slacks , and the villain " Tree " , sporting a veddy British accent . You can pretty much figure out the plot halfway through the opening credits , but relax-just enjoy the giddy mediocrity of this 70 's movie of the week . Whenever I think of this movie ( and I think of this movie often ) , I catch myself humming the theme , written for flute and tuba .. no one knows why . Trivia note-Diamond Head was directed by Jeannot Szwarc , one of three contract directors at Universal who would go on to make much bigger films , in his case Jaws 2 . The others were John Badham ( War Games ) , and a young fellow named Steven Spielberg ..  
  Hello I am from Denmark , and one day i was having a film evening with my friends . One brought this movie with him " Russian terminator " and it was extremely awful . After watching less than half a minute we decided to fast forward only stopping at some laughable " highlights " or should i say " lowlights " in the movie . I was actually mostly surprised to find out that this film was produced here in my homeland Denmark .. that must have been the biggest mistake this country ever made .  
  Wow , the spookiest thing about this episode was the price of houses 40 years ago . I 'll preface by saying I 'm not a fan of narrated episodes . If the story / actors / etc . are worth their salt , they should be able to convey the bulk of the narrative without having to read it out , reminded me of personages who can't think off the cuff but rely on teleprompters . The psychobabble was tedious and boring , but some enjoy that kind of thing , it 's just not my cup O tea . They could have kept the narrative but at least made it much more believable and interesting if it was coming from a psychiatrist or maybe a newspaper reporter or something . Niggling little things like Peugeot being at the house , which has a singular half circle driveway , yet he seems to have parked his car in the tree he was standing under , because it 's nowhere to be seen on the road or on the property . Sloppy editing , as she pulls into the driveway ( for what seems the 100th time ) exactly who are those 2 guys you see at 24m30s walking towards the car as she pulls into the driveway of the deserted house ? The dolly close-ups were also overdone , like some Jr . High drama student discovering the zoom function on his camera for the first time . I could keep picking apart , but that might get almost as boring as this episode was . It kept dragging on and the true purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all the stock footage they had shot of Elaine driving the Newport convertible . I fully expected to see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle play while a voice over told us all about the 8 track player , automatic top etc . The only good thing I have to say about his one is that it just ends , abruptly . No loose ends tied up , nothing explained or terminated . Not that many would notice , I suspect most had already changed the channel or dozed off by the end .  
  This self proclaimed " very talented artist " have directed easily the worst Spanish film of the 21st century . Lack of emotion , coherence , rhythm , skills , humor .. it repeats the same situation over and over again . It shows no character development . It does not even show any violent and / or sexual content , and it does not add anything new to the psycho-killer sub genre . So lame it should be shown at film schools as an example of " what not to do " in a first movie . BTW where the hell is the " talent " ? there are scenes which have been shot almost identically ; there are scenes which have two or more master shots and it is quite awful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a reason . The camera almost never moves , as if the " very talented artist " was afraid of showing his lack of visual skills . The actors playing the main roles act like amateurs , and the supporting cast is hardly believable . There are more holes than plot in the script ( if ever there was one ) .. A really disheartening movie , and a whatsoever talented director .  
  For a made-for-TV " horror " movie the movie started off very interesting . I was really intrigued by the story and the mystery of the film . But the ending was a total dissappointment . The movie was going along fast-paced and was building up to , it seemed like anyway , to a very climatic end . But guess what there is no end . The movie is just over and after almost one and a half hours the audience is just left wondering what happened . Why were all the unanswered questions in the film left unanswered . There was no explanation at all about any of the key points in the plot . This film is like watching a murder mystery and then never finding out who did it . Very dissappointed . This film looks like the producers just ran out of money and never completed the film . A real BOMB !  
  Almost as tedious to watch as it was to read , Evening is a gorgeously produced failure .. until Meryl Streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff . Vanessa Redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying Ann and Claire Danes is a cipher . Perhaps if Vanessa and Claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young Ann that gave her entrée to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older Ann actually was dying . I was hoping the addition of Michael Cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas . It gave me a headache .  
  * SPOILERS * * SPOILERS * When I saw a preview for this movie I thought it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline . But as most superstation original movies I was left disapointed . This gullible family ends up driving through this " deserted " town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their donig and finds out they all eventually disappear , the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them . Their are more gaps than I can count and they don't explain anything that happens how or what . It ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or brainwashed or something ( which is never explained ) . The next thing you know ur hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you completely confused .  
  Chris , an adopted son of a moral family , a loser whom works at the school newspaper with Kate ( Christine Lakin from of the awful sugary " Step by Step " show of the now thankfully defunct ABC 's TGIF line-up ) , finds out that he 's just inherited a porn empire from his biological parents . He loses sight of what true friendship and love is and blah blah some other nonsense . He also has to contend with an Uncle who wants control of the family business and a shifty lawyer ( arn't they are ? ) A slightly below average teen comedy that steals from better teen comedies ( the opening alone is HIGHLY American Pie-esquire ) , bops you on the head with the moral every chance it gets , and wastes the only star talent it has ( Wayne Newton , Lin Shaye , and if i 'm really stretching the star word , Martin Starr of " Freaks and Geeks " , and Justin Berfield of " Malcolm in the Middle " ) . It 's not bad exactly , but it 's far from good . Eye Candy : a few extras get topless My Grade : C- Where I saw it : Starz on Demand ( available until September 29th )  
  This is , without a doubt , the most offensive " chick flick " I have seen in years , if not ever . The writing & characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody . Before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster , we were subjected to the following themes : having a baby will solve all of your problems , " performer types " are miserable messes , & musicians can't be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle . What a waste of a talented cast & some great-looking sets & costumes . When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life , she 'll end up - shudder - " alone ! " , I felt queasy . I can't believe this movie made it to theatrical release . It 's the sort of fare one expects from those " women 's " cable channels that I always pass right by when channel-surfing . I am female and over 35 , so I should be part of this film 's target audience , but boy , does " Evening " miss its target .  
  I bought this movie because this was Shah rukh khans Debut . And i also liked to see how would he do . I must say he is excellent in his role . Divya Bharathi is superb in this movie . Rishi does a wonderful job . Susham Seth supported well . Alok nath was good in his role . Amrish and Mohnish did their parts well too . Dalip also was good in his small role . Actors shine in a Mediocre movie . The direction is average . The editing is poor . The story is boring . It tells us about Ravi a famous pop singer . He has a lot of female fans . One of them is Kaajal . Ravi and Kaajal fall in love and get married . Ravi gets killed by his cousins . Kaajal becoems a widow .. To escape from Ravis cousins . They go to Bombay . She comes across Raja . She falls in love with him and gets married . Ravi returns . The story is predictable . The climax is predictable . The first half bores . It also drags a lot . But it is saved by the actors and music . The second half entertains . The music is catchy with some nice songs . The cinematography looks outdated in the first half but it looks unimaginative . The song picturisations are dull except for " Sochenge Tumhe Pyar " and one rain song . The costumes are outdated . Any way watch this just for the actors and music Rating-4/10  
  I am not one of those people that will walk out of a movie that was based on source material and automatically say , " The book was better . " I know better than to demote the value of a movie just because it wasn't a faithful adaptation . There is a lengthy process and lots of decisions that go into making a movie that are sometimes out of the director 's / editor 's / cinematographer 's / producer 's control and certainly out of the original author 's control . Therefore , it is unreasonable to expect a movie to be exactly the same , word for word , as a book or play or video game or Disneyland Ride , or whatever ! A movie should be judged on its own standard and how it fits in society . Moreover , a successful movie should be made because the material is relevant to the society which it belongs and , if it is based on source material , its relevance needs to be reexamined and enhanced by the filmmakers . Films like There Will Be Blood follow this paradigm because while it was based on a novel written at the turn of the century , Oil ! , it feels relevant because of things like the Iraq war and energy concerns that the film 's country of origin , the US , was and is experiencing . Even King Kong , based on the original film , benefits from using new technology and concerns of animal rights that people have . With that said , I just don't understand why they even bothered to make this movie ? Besides the great performances , guaranteed Oscar nods and Shanley 's director / writers fee and royalties he will get , this movie seems to come from nowhere . It should have simply stayed as a play . The movie ( which is essentially the same as the play ) says nothing new about the reprehensible sexual atrocities committed and in many cases covered up by the Catholic church here and abroad . It says nothing new or different than the original play . I can't help but compare this movie to another movie that came out at around the same time : Frost / Nixon , which was also based on a play . Frost / Nixon , while about Nixon 's regrets , seems relevant because it seems to have come at a time when President Bush was about to leave office . The regrets that Nixon had , as depicted in the play / movie , about the war and his presidency could just as easily reflected on Bush and his presidency . In that respect Frost / Nixon seemed more relevant and actually benefited from a wider distribution via film because it got people talking and reflecting about the political status quo in the country at the time . In contrast , Doubt felt like it was yesterday 's news and didn't seem to offer anything that the play didn't offer . Of course the movie is " good , " the performances are outstanding , and the screenplay adaptation is apt , but so what ? Why didn't it just stay as a play ? Why , besides marketing and financial reasons , make it into a movie ? It gave audiences nothing new to discus about the awful subject .  
  A squashy slapstick mess posing as a comedy . Elvis Presley plays an Indian bull-riding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks ' desert-spread in Arizona , where government suits have just invested in the family 's herd of cattle ( which is in dire need of a stud ) . What director Peter Tewksbury is in dire need of is some narrative skills , though what he lacks in assessment he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages ( his social commentary isn't exactly pointed , but Tewksbury does have a satiric bend to his outlandishness and there are some funny scenes ) . Despite colorful supporting turns by Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell , the general wackiness gets way out of hand , and there 's too much hoopin ' and hollerin ' to sustain much interest . As for Elvis , he 's loose and frisky throughout-and while it 's nice to see him having fun on-screen , one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point . This shambles of a picture has a distinct what-the-hell feel to it , and though spirits are high , the returns are mostly low . * 1/2 from *  
  " Nada " was the most inadequate follow-up to " Les NOces Rouges " which , with hindsight , appears now as the last good movie of Chabrol 's golden era ( 1967-1973 ) " Nada " is Chabrol 's first real attempt at a wholly political movie ; its previous work " les Noces Rouges " had also political elements but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in French provinces . " Nada " includes terrorists , ambassador , hostage-taking , a lot of blood , not really Chabrol 's field . A heterogeneous cast gives the movie the coup de grâce : only Duchaussoy , who had already played with the director , and Maurice Garrel are up to scratch . Viviane Romance , one of Duvivier 's actresses ( " la Belle Equipe " " Panique " ) , is wasted as a madam ( Gabrielle ) . Italian actors ( Fabio Testi , Lou Castel ) are awful . With " Nada " this a second period of barren inspiration for Chabrol . It would be " Violette Nozières " before he was again at the top of his game .  
  Released on DVD in the UK as Axe , The Choke is a teen slasher that fails in pretty much every department : the story is almost non-existent , resulting in a film which comprises mostly of people wandering around a dark building ; with the exception of two characters ( who are quite obviously destined to be the film 's survivors ) , everyone is thoroughly objectionable , meaning that the viewer couldn't care less when they get slaughtered ; the deaths aren't gory enough ( unless a brief shot of a pound of minced beef covered in fake blood turns your stomach ) ; and the gratuitous sex scene features next to no nudity ( an unforgivable mistake to make in a slasher flick ! ) . The wafer-thin plot sees members of a punk band locked inside what appears to be the world 's largest nightclub ( there are endless abandoned corridors and rooms , unlike any club I 've ever seen ) where they are picked off by an unseen assailant . For a low budget effort , the production values are okay , and the cast are all seem to be fairly capable actors , but with not nearly enough genuine scares , a reluctance to get really messy ( this is a slasher , so where 's the graphic splatter ? ) , way too much dreadful dialogue ( particularly from the not dead soon enough drummer ) and some ill advised use of tacky video techniques in an attempt to add some style , the movie quickly becomes extremely boring .  
  It was 1974 and it starred Martin Sheen . That alone says what to expect of this movie . And it was a movie . According to the movie , Slovik had reformed , got a good woman , and didn't want to fight . In real life , Slovik may have been a naive innocent , or he may have just wanted to manipulate the system . Whoever Slovik was or wasn't is for history to decide , but this was a movie that dealt with dessertion at a time when a country was questioning why it was fighting , and the movie took sides . With no regard to servicemen who were in Viet Nam either in 1974 ( as Willie Nelson would say , let 's tell the truth , it was about the Viet Nam war , not WWII ) , EoES was as propagandistic as Gung Ho was in the forties . According to this movie , Slovik stated his position , plain and simple . He had a nervous problem . Heck , I have a clinical nervous condition , and trust me , if I had done military duty , it would have been no problem for me to either just let my nerves go and fail at my tasks and get a demotion or put on KP duty or latrine duty with no problem . If we believe the teleflick , Slovik didn't have that option , no doubt because of his criminal history . Whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer . I 've learned that movies from this decade or that decade , in dealing with service or military duty , will pretty much take the same stance over and over . 1940s and 1950s , serve your country . 1960s and 1970s , mock your country . This is the history . The whole movie seemed predictably Hollywood to me . He refused to serve and only when he was being strapped up to be executed does he show emotion . Such an emotional outburst could have easily worked to his advantage in his declaration of his nervous condition , but obviously the movie wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die does he become sorrowful . I 'm not a Catholic , but I thought the recital of the hail Mary by Ned Beatty and Sheen at the end , with the Lord 's prayer , was funny as it sounded like they were trying to see who could say it faster . I don't see how this movie could be watched without realizing it was aimed at Tricky Dick Nixon and the Viet Nam war . I hope it was all worth it for Slovik and anyone who chose to follow his example .  
  this is just usual Indian garbage that gets turned out as cinema , as Indians we can proudly boast that we have the biggest cinema industry , however it also the worst . how can other poor countries have films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on pumping out garbage . take a look at Russia , Iran , china and Latin America , look at the brilliant films they have and we get crap like Kisna ! get real people , no wonder the international community in general laughs at Indian cinema .  
  Typical Troma-trash , this smutty 80 's flick is considered one of the " highlights " of Lloyd Kaufman 's notorious production studio , alongside " The Toxic Avenger " released one year earlier . " The Toxic Avenger " is far superior if you ask me , but this demented splatter-flick is nevertheless endurable as well ; just make sure you leave your full brain capacity at the door . The events take place in Tromaville , a little town that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world , and they certainly aren't lying . The safety precautions in the local nuclear power plant are substandard , to say the least ( even Homer Simpson never was this nonchalant ) and toxic waste seeps through to the nearby high school . The first intoxicated victim is the stereotypical nerd , who starts spurting green stuff out of all his body cavities , but his death is believed to be an accident because he had no less than TWO microwave ovens in his house ! Oh , the humanity ! Shortly after , however , the nuclear leaks also affect the school 's weed plantation and thing really start to get messy . After smoking a joint at a party , the cutest couple in school produce a gigantic worm monster that settles in the basement and feeds on teenage scum . " Class of Nuke ' em High " is bottom of the barrel horror film-making , with dialogs so dumb they hurt your ears and make-up effects that give a whole new meaning to the word tasteless . If you enjoy watching faces melting away , getting crushed or splitting in half , this is definitely a must-see ! Unlike the aforementioned " The Toxic Avenger " , this film suffers from a couple of really dull and overlong moments where nothing really significant happens , like for example when Chrissy and Warren try to figure out what 's wrong with their hormones . The crude humor isn't as effective as in " Toxic Avenger " and the acting performances are unforgivably amateurish . Proceed only if you 're an avid Troma-fanatic .  
  I 've been going through the AFI 's list of the top 100 comedies , and I must say that this is truly one of the worst . Not just of the 90 movies on the list I 've seen , but of any movie I 've ever seen . Drunks are funny sometimes , Dudley isn't . Liza almost made it worthwhile , but alas .. just go watch Arrested Development if you want to see her in something good . Seriously , Dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny ? I would highly recommend almost ANY other movie on the AFI 's top 100 comedies for more laughs than this . If you want to see a funnier " drunk " , try The Thin Man . Funnier movie in general , any Marx Brothers movie will kill ( especially if you 're as drunk as Arthur ) .  
  I sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn't take anymore . It felt as though I 'd watched dozens of episodes already , and then it hit me .. There 's nothing new here ! I 've heard that joke on Seinfeld , I saw someone fall like that on friends , an episode of Happy Days had almost the same storyline , ect . None of the actors are interesting here either ! Some were good on other shows ( not here ) , and others are new to a profession they should have never entered . Avoid this stinker !  
  The ' 60s is an occasionally entertaining film , most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film . It is extremely uneven , and includes many annoying elements . Take for instance the switch between black & white , and color . If done right , this could of been fairly effective , but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience ; much of the film had an odd feel to it . The acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for TV flick , but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times . Many of the events were not coherent , and ending up being confusing . How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960 's ? The ending was much too sappy for my tastes ; because it was hollywoodized , everything had to turn out right in the end . I would advise you to not waste your time on The ' 60s and do something else with your time . I 'm glad I watched this in class , and not on my own time . I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylan 's music . Those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick . I hope you take my advice , and stay away from this .  
  The 1960 's were a time of change and awakening for most people . Social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke-out about their views . Racial tensions , politics , the Vietnam War , sexual promiscuity , and drug use were all part of the daily fabric , and the daily news . This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie , and largely succeeded . In this film , two families are followed : one white , one black . During the first half of the film , the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles . Unfortunately , the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family . Admittedly , there are more characters in this family , and the story lines are intermingled , but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century . On the whole , the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie . The movie is a work of fiction , but clips of well-known historical figures are used to set the time-line . I enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one-sided .  
  The problem is the role of the characters in the film . Man to Man shows a British anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to Scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself . The problem is the role of the pygmies in the film - two people who are kidnapped , treated like animals , and yet given such a shallow , stereotypical role within the film .. The kidnapper ( british anthropologist ) ends up being the hero of the film because he ' manages ' to relate to the pygmies .. No notion of how the two hostages feel , of their point of view , of their ordeal .. I find it is a shallow film , with a one sided fundamentally racist view .. it never manages to move away from the ' white mans ' view  
  Saw it at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Fest . What can I say ? Against my better judgment , I liked it , but it seemed to me that that acting was a little .. weak ( mostly I noticed this from the family of the teen boy ) . I mean , the script wasn't stellar to begin with , but the actors didn't make me believe the relationships . The plot is also predictable . Nonethelss , I liked it . The characters are likable , and the plot is not challenging or upsetting . It 's sweet , the characters care about each other , and I don't count it as fifty minutes ill-spent . But I don't recommend it .  
  This documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence , in which Brian Flemming , perhaps purposely , fails to mention important evidence to the contrary . Perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest : His claims concerning the invalidity of Paul 's testimony about Jesus Christ disregard key facts , like : * The existence of some formulated creeds within Paul 's letters . These creeds suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of Christ 's death and resurrection . * The testimonies of the early Christians can't just be tossed out as mere fantasy . There were indeed many people claiming to be the Messiah during that period , but only ONE of them has remained : Jesus . Why ? Because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed Christ was the messiah , and go on to die for those beliefs , if they knew that he had not been resurrected . * Even if the Gospels are dated more liberally , we are still talking about accounts of Jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these Gospels . And there is evidence that the Gospels were written much earlier . What I am saying is that Flemming 's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-serving piece of work that hodge podges different arguments and evidence to serve his anti-Christian view . Don't be fooled by poor investigation .  
  I just rented ( yes ! I paid money to see ! ) this film . OMG . It is one of the very worst films I have ever seen . As another reviewer put it , Ms . Colagrande , get out of films , PLEASE ! Please never make or appear in another film ! The lady has the charisma of a cantaloupe . No , that 's not fair to the cantaloupe , which probably has more going for it . She does not know how to act ; she affects a disgusted look ALL the time ( reminded me very much of my always-disgusted young sisters-in-law from Europe ) . She is not charming ; she is not pretty . There is no real story . And the editing ! There WASN'T any , that I could see ! It 's pretty bad when you are watching a film and , just to get through it , you press " forward forward " on your remote , and STILL nothing happens ! I mean ! .. I kept involuntarily screaming , " Cut ! Cut ! " What WERE they thinking ? Well , obviously , they thought they would make a film together and get PAID to make love on screen ! Pretty good deal for THEM ; pretty raw deal for the viewer ! I think I 'm going to throw up now ..  
  The same difficulty I have with the musical version of " Les Miserables " applies equally to " Oliver . " Instead of the composers ' writing in the stylistic period of the play settings , they merely wrote Broadway-type melodies , which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed . Too , the blatant brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties which permeate the score . It 's a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste . The casting of the boy Oliver doesn't help matters : tentative of timbre and vexingly precious , there 's something less than solid here . Fagin performs his traditional routine adequately , though the tunes he 's obliged to sing have little basis in period manner . " As Long As He Needs Me " is given a strident rendition , throaty and strained . The two big production numbers , " Who Will Buy " and " Consider Yourself " seem over-produced , with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in . It 's one thing to go all out , yet another to cross over the line into excess . The gloom , despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography . While the novel is considered a classic , I must confess I have trouble with Mr . Dickens ' consciousness , in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration . This may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life , which was full of disappointment and regret . Not all the combined talent of this production , either on - or behind camera , can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material . All this results in an uncomfortably downer experience for me .  
  This movie was very very mediocre and very very gory . everyone left their acting lessons at home and totally forgot how to act I mean it was so bad and had no real plot and kindergarteners could have written a better story plot wait what story plot . not at all scary !  
  National Treasure is about as over-rated and over-hyped as they come . Nicholas Cage is in no way a believable action hero , and this film is no " Indiana Jones " . People who have compared this movie to the Indian Jones classic trilogy have seriously fallen off their rocker . I can't really figure out what kind of target audience this film was shooting for . Maybe the pre-teen audience will like it , but I found it to be absolutely ludicrous . I also can't imagine adults or young adults to find this to be that great of a film . Simply put : it 's just OK at best . National Treasure is unimagined and uninspired , borrowing what it does have from " The Da Vinci Code " . I would recommend waiting for that movie to be released in 2006 , and passing on this nonsense . The whole idea of being able to so easily steal the Declaration of Independence and run around all over Washington DC and Philadelphia with it ( while never damaging it once ) , while fighting the " bad guys " and experiencing what is supposed to be " non-stop action " is absurd . I particularly loved the scene with the Declaration folded in its tube laying in the middle of a busy road while cars whiz by it without damaging it . Oh brother ! Reminded me of that episode of the " Brady Bunch " where they go to the amusement park and Mr . Brady loses his architectural plans . Except , that episode of the Brady Bunch was much better than this whole film ! The idea of such huge treasure that nobody believes exists being buried within a secret ruin of the US is outlandish . Literally , there are thousand of undiscovered " priceless " items in this treasure trove . Yeah right ! Ridiculous ! Even worse , the speed and accuracy of which Cage finds and figures out what are supposed to be " tough " clues to these ancient riddles are pre-posterous ! Oh .. the humanity ! The performances by Cage , Voight , and the other actors in " National Treasure " are as stiff , wooden , and flat as they come . However , when you 're working with such lousy dialogue , it 's hard to fault the actor 's 100 % for that . National Treasure is an OK film to see once . I can't recommend it beyond that and would definitely NOT purchase this over the top , outlandish scavenger hunt of a mess . Rent it if you must see it first ..  
  .. though for a film that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror , there was a distinct lack of blood . There was also a distinct lack of skilled directing , acting , editing , and script-writing . Jeremy London put in one of most appalling performances I 've ever seen - his " descent into the maelström " of madness is achingly self-aware and clumsy . Oh look at him twitch ! Oh look at him drink strong spirits ! Oh look at him raise his brow , and cock his head at a jaunty angle ! Oh look at his unwashed , greasy dark hair ! Oh listen to his affectedly husky voice ! He must be a tortured artist / writer / genius ! Oh , yes , out comes the poet-shirt - it 's another boy who thinks he 's Byron . ( Or Poe . ) Oh for the love of .. did someone give this guy a manual on " How To Act Good " or did they just pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere , the defunct little plastic toy-prize in a discontinued brand of bargain-bin cereal . Okay , that was a stupid line - but that 's only because London 's performance has melted my brain with its awfulness . Katherine Heigl is cute , and very briar rose , but has yet to grow into her acting shoes in this film - she delivered her lines like she was being held up , in fact , her whole performance was very wooden , her poses as stiff as her lines - who knows , perhaps she was just reacting to , and trying to neutralise , Jeremy London 's flailing excesses , but if that 's the case , she takes it too far . Notable is Arie Verveen as Poe - while his character 's role is confused , he delivers the best performance of the piece . He , quite simply , looks right , but it 's more than that - he has some sort of depth , I believed that he had a life beyond the dismal two-dimensional quality of the rest of the characters . Huh , maybe it 's just because I like Poe , and could thus just let my mind wander and invent while he was on screen - whatever , he had an interest factor otherwise missing . The rest of the characters are a faceless blur - there are all the usual caricatures : the perky blonde best-friend who 's a bit of a floozy ; the smitten local cop who 's a bit of a dork ; the protective older man who perhaps has too much un-fatherly interest in our heroine ; the scheming old witch , etc . , etc . , yawn , yawn . As with the ' distinct lack of blood for a horror movie ' issue , none of the themes that they mention ( and that London 's character mentions - so scathingly - in his attack on Poe 's writing ) are followed through on . As another reviewer said - there was potential here : murder , incest , - genuinely shocking stuff , but instead they skirt away from the issues , and cut away from the violence ( a raised candlestick swinging through the air - closing in on it 's victim - then-cut to black ! This is fine in a Noirish traditional horror , indeed , it 's expected , and is fondly received when it happens - it 's a dear convention , especially when accompanied by fake lightning bolts and intense Siouxie eye makeup - but in ' Descendant ' it just comes across as clumsy , or as though the editor got queasy at the last minute and cut it out . ) This could have either been a very tense psychological thriller - the horror of palingenesis / delusion / madness - or a simple ( and fun ) slasher movie : it tries to be both , or neither ( something new and exciting ! ) , but either way it fails dismally . The only horror element of this entire movie is it 's epic dullness . I think the editor ( if there was one at all ) must have been drunk when s / he chopped this thing up - there are awkwardly foreshortened scenes ; scenes that appeared to be out of order ( but that could have just been the poor script ) . LIkewise the director & cinematographer - there were some very strange shots and framing that I think were meant to be tributes to Hitchcock or Browning , but just ended up looking silly ( again , fine in a noir , but this was trying to be something else . ) The whole thing perhaps may have been funny ( in that way that previous reviewers have mentioned - " OMG how did this get made ? ! ? " ) if I had been in the mood for some trash - bagging , unfortunately for me I had settled on the couch , with the lights down low , with the express intention of scaring myself silly - this is a very poor film , and I 'm afraid I can't recommend it to people , not even for laughs . Please , please , don't waste your time or money on this - either borrow a real horror / thriller film , or find yourself a copy of Poe 's fantastical tales , either way , you 'll have a far more enjoyable and frightening night than you could ever hope to achieve with this rubbish .  
  Hollywood does it again . Lots of money , no creativity . I 'm sure the writers were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this one . Based on the previews , I thought that this would be a funny movie . But if you are not up on the latest stupid pop culture then you 'll miss most of the silly humor in this movie . Why waste your time . You can sit on a log doing nothing and have more fun than this movie will provide .  
  Hi folks Forget about that movie . John C . should be ashamed that he appears as executive producer in the credits . bon jovi has never been and will never be an actor and the FX are a joke . The first vampires was good .. and it was the only vampires . This thing here just wears the same name . Just a waste of time thinks .. JAKE Scorpio  
  First of all , Jon Bon Jovi doesn't seem to be in place in a vampire movie . Together with the other not so interesting characters and the poor storyline the whole movie becomes predictable . If you keep that in mind and you 're a total vampire movie fan , you can have some fun with a few of the scenes . Don't expect any Tarantino-style chapters here and neither an Anne Rice storyline . ( I expect to have have forgotten the whole movie by tomorrow ; )  
  When you look at this now and hear all the language in here , it 's amazing this was rated " PG , " but that 's the 1970s rating system for you . Peter Falk spews out the Lord 's name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie ! Yet , few people consider that offensive , and certainly not the scumbags who make movies nor the people who " rate " them . The cast is a clue to how profane this film can be : Falk , Peter Boyle , Allen Garfield , Warren Oates , Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino aren't exactly actors you wouldn't find in " The Sound Of Music . " I like heist movies , and a lot of films by director William Friedkin , but this script doesn't deliver and it just has way too much of the " Sleazy ' 70s " feel to it , visually and audibly . For those who loved Falk in TV 's " Columbo " it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in films . This is far from the only case .  
  Back when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a mercurial , hot-tempered , high-powered Hollywood couple they filmed this ( nearly ) scene-for-scene remake of the 1972 Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw action-thriller about a fugitive twosome . It almost worked the first time because McQueen was such a vital presence on the screen-even stone silent and weary , you could sense his clock ticking , his cagey magnetism . Baldwin is not in Steve McQueen 's league , but he has his charms and is probably a more versatile actor-if so , this is not a showcase for his attributes . Basinger does well and certainly looks good , but James Woods is artificially hammy in a silly mob-magnet role . A sub-plot involving another couple taken hostage by Baldwin 's ex-partner was unbearable in the ' 72 film and plays even worse here . As for the action scenes , they 're pretty old hat , which causes one to wonder : why even remake the original ? * from *  
  I cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie . The 1972 movie with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic . Steve McQueen was an outstanding actor and Baldwin is only an inadequate actor . He has no passion in his play . Also the action in the original " Getaway " was fantastic . But the remake has no action ! It is almost boring despite the fact that the film-making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994 . I don't understand the way that Baldwin imprisoned from Mexico . I think this is a mistake in the story . So i think that there was no need to remake it , or if they decided to remake a classic , they must choose an excellent actor for the first role , like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ..  
  - what happened to these unlikeable people . Alan Arkin was , as usual , unfunny and just walks through the role . The kids are all a mess . Mariesa Tomei probably wishes this role had never come her way . And what are Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno doing in this really bad , mean movie ? If you enjoy watching losers wallow in their disfunction , and not try in any way to do better , this is your film . All others , take a walk , read a book , or see something else . Jane  
  3lbs is obviously just a self indulgent programme for Stanley Tucci to be a producer / moody deep doctor . Unlike House he has absolutely no personality and unlike Grey 's Anatomy the brain surgery cases are't even interesting . This programme is supposed to be set in a leading centre for Neurlogical cases - yet there 's nothing interesting or exciting going on ! Not even the so called pathetic ' feud ' between him and a rival adds anything to the show and neither do those hallucinations . In the pilot there was a brief glimpse into the leads 's social life as a father - snooze ! boring and pointless . This show is pants , there 's a glut of medical dramas around at the moment and this does nothing to make it stand out as special .  
  Well to answer one persons 's question of " why doesn't anyone remember this film ? " it 's because really , not that many people saw it in 1978 and it 's not been shown much on TV since . ( If it 's on video that 'd be news to me ! ) Even in the era of sometimes mindless comedies that was the ' 70s , movie-goers had the smarts to avoid this film . Unless they love Billy Crytal , Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers " that " much ! Paul Lynde was funnier on " Bewitched " or " Hollywood Squares " than here . Joan Rivers at this time in her career was getting laughs making cruel jokes about singer Karen Carpenter 's lack of weight ! Har-har Joan ! It also seems like every " somewhat " famous name from the era is in the cast . ( Most surprising is Doris Roberts later of " Everybody Loves Raymond " . ) Anyhow , a somewhat good idea for a storyline , a man getting pregnant instead of the woman goes to waste here . With help from a male friend Crystal gets set up with a hooker to finally lose his virginity but because she was " on top " instead of him , he gets pregnant ! ( A commentary on women taking positions of power away from men ) . Crystal 's stomach grows , he goes through all the female emotions and related feelings . Unfortunately , he is now a socially misunderstood outcast ! He 's attacked by a mob who wants him rubbed out ( I guess ) . He 's forced to go into seclusion to have his baby .. in a barn . Or if you will , a manger ( God only knows where it may have exited from ! Eww ! ) It turns out ( no shock here ) to be a girl ! Everything else about this movie is worthless and forgettable , the humor is high school level or less . 2 stars for a good idea and a few good touching & relevant moments w / Billy Crystal . Ignore the rest of Rabitt Test , it flunks big time ! I can't believe Roddy McDowell signed on either ! ( END )  
  I really can't believe this movie is not in the IMDB worst 250 , it is absolutely terrible . When I originally saw it I remember talking about it in a college class and two other people had also seen it . We were all telling other class members not to see it because it was so horrible . By the time we were done some others wanted to see it just because they could not believe anything was as bad as we were saying it was . Don't be like them , just pass this by . I 'm sure everyone involved with this movie would also prefer you never see them in this movie .  
  I am quite sure that this was the worst movie ever made . If you can't make a 13 year old boy laugh at silly humor you should give up comedy forever . Unfortunately Joan Rivers chose differently . The movie is full of predictable gags ( some of these are racist ) and very unfunny jokes . Particularly memorable is the scene where the doctor tells the lead character that the rabbit has died and he is pregnant ( as I write this , I cannot believe this was actually a movie scene ) . The man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctors desk and tries to give it mouth to mouth . ROTFLMAO ! NOT ! The punch line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is " I knew I should have been on top . " ha ha ha ha ah ugh ..  
  After what I thought was a masterful performance of two roles in Man From Snowy River , WHY was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy in the sequel ? It just wasn't the same without Spur and Harrison , as portrayed by Douglas . Maybe he recognized how poor the plot was-Jim returns after extended absence , to find Jessica being pursued by another man . He could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him , and not find competition . For a Disney movie , this contains foul language , plus the highly unnecessary part when Jim & Jessica shacked up without being married-very LAME . Quite an insult to viewer intelligence , according to members of my family . I 'll stick with the first one , and try to forget I ever saw the sequel !  
  The film starts to slowly when we got to the cinema we thought it looked quite good but after about 5 mins we were all bored out of our minds and wondering what kind of film we had come to see , i don't like this film and wouldn't recommend it to anyone , the best part of the night was when the alarm and lights came back on because the project broke down because we thought we could all go home . this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen we were all bored out of or minds and most of the people in the cinema actually RAN out of the doors at the end because it was so rubbish . i am surprised that no one walked out earlier than that . if you go and see it make sure you something to keep you busy , better still Don't go and see it at all .  
  I am compelled to write a review of this IMAX feature as a means of warning others to SAVE YOUR MONEY . Almost any episode of Desmond Morris ' " The Human Animal " or David Suzuki 's " The Nature of Things " could have bested the material presented . Not only does the director fail to make use of IMAX 's incredible 65 to 70 mm film stock and gigantic presentation screen , everything on screen is extremely unimpressive given the accessibility of such programming mentioned previously . Viewers are introduced to a pregnant Heather , her husband Buster , and their niece and nephew . We follow them for an interminable forty-odd minutes as they eat , sweat , listen to music , etc . Although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies ' natural diving reflexes , do we really learn anything more than most grade-school graduates ? Are we even remotely entertained by the trans-Atlantic Heather ? Do we care ? Avoid this film at all cost . If you do wish to see an IMAX feature , I suggest the beautifully photographed " India : Kingdom of the Tiger " or the technically thrilling " Space Station 3D " . Trust me .  
  I was really , really disappointed with this movie . it started really well , and built up some great atmosphere and suspense , but when it finally got round to revealing the " monster " .. it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems .. again . Whoop-de-do . Yet another nutjob movie .. like we don't already have enough of them . To be fair , the " creep " is genuinely unsettling to look at , and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy , but I 'm sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human , albeit a twisted , demented , freakish one . When I saw all the tell-tale rats early on I was hoping for some kind of freaky rat-monster hybrid thing .. it was such a let down when the Creep was revealed . On top of this , some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense . ( Spoiler ) Why the hell does the Creep kill the security Guard ? Whats the point , apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says " HI I 'm A PSYCHO AND I LIVE DOWN HERE ! " ? Its stupid , and only seems to happen to prevent Franka Potente 's character from getting help . what the hells he been eating down there ? I got the impression he was effectively walled in , and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose .. so has he been munching rats all that time , and if so why do they hang around him so much ? Why is he so damn hard to kill ? He 's thin , malnourished and not exactly at peak performance .. but seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that . cripple the non-psycho characters in the film . The DVD commentary says we are intended to empathise with Creep , but I just find him loathsome . Its an effective enough movie , but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick .  
  I just rented Creep and was not at all impressed . I didn't feel anything in this film . I felt sick because the gore alone was shocking . I walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film . Haven't we seen this all before ? I didn't like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage . I felt bad for him . But then again I couldn't think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the Creep ? So many questions need to be answered . Someone mentioned references to the PS2 game Silent Hill and I can see similarities vaguely . Not a bad film , not a good one . judge for yourself .  
  In the small American town of Meadowvale Dr . Anthony Blake ( David Gale , the IMDb listing for this character is wrong it 's definitely Dr . Blake not Dr . Blakely ) is the director and founder of the famed ' Psychological Research Institute ' and also host 's a local T.V. programme called ' Independent Thinkers ' . He uses this T.V. show to hypnotise the viewers and make them commit acts of violence . Dr . Blake has the help of a large brain with an evil face that uses it 's spinal cord as a tail thingy . Usually the brain is just sitting in a tank , eats mice and the odd bad actor , each time it eats someone it gets much bigger . Meanwhile at the local high-school gifted but troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski ( Tom Bresnahan ) has been caught putting Sodium down the toilets . Jim is sent to Dr . Blake at the PRI for help with his attitude and behavioural problems . While there Dr . Blake hooks Jim up to , well something I 'm not actually sure what . This whatever it is , is attached to the brain . At first Jim is able to resist the brain 's mind control . The brain feels that Jim is a threat to itself and it 's plans . Once out of the PRI Jim starts having bizarre hallucinations and crashes his car . Jim makes it to his waitress girlfriend Janet ( Cynthia Preston as Cyndy Preston ) but is handed back to Dr . Blake 's assistant Verna ( George Buza ) soon after by Officer Marks ( Harry Booker ) . The brain wants to kill Jim because he is the only one capable of withstanding it 's mind control techniques , and with ' Independent Thinkers ' going national the brain doesn't want anything or anyone to stop it 's evil plan for world domination ! Jim quickly realises that the brain is controlling the entire town and he alone must stop the brain , before it takes over the world ! Directed by Ed Hunt who calls himself Edward Hunt here , the Brain wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be . Don't get me wrong as it certainly isn't great either . The script by Barry Pearson tries a stab at satire with the brain washing and mind control by T.V. storyline . It moves along at a fair pace and isn't too boring . No explanation is given for the existence of the brain at all , it 's just there and that 's it we have to accept it . The story is a little choppy and never fully explores one single element , there 's the T.V. mind control , the brain itself , Jim being hunted by the police & his misbehaviour and various other little bits and pieces here and there including a bizarre revelation regarding Dr . Blake that isn't explained at all . Production wise this film looks cheap , and probably was cheap . The acting isn't great but I 've seen worse , and what is David Gale doing in this ? In fact this role is similar to Gale 's role in Re-Animator ( 1985 ) even down to his character 's deaths in both films . The brain itself at first sits in a tank and starts to grow whenever it eats someone and by the end it is pretty big . Each stage is just made of rubber . It doesn't look particularly good and isn't scary or creepy , just cheap . There 's no blood or gore in it apart from a blink and you 'll miss it decapitation . The nudity is provided by Dr . Blake 's assistant Vivian ( Christine Kossak as Christine Kossack ) before she gets eaten . The brain had a certain entertainment value for me but I would think most people would dislike it . Maybe worth a watch if you can see it on T.V. for free .  
  Absolutely laughable film . I live in London and the plot is so ill-researched it 's ridiculous . No one could be terrorised on the London Underground . In the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs , etc . That there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely . Or that it 's even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and age .. The worst that 's likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them . Although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network , another thorn in the side of the story . ( Remember in London as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world . ) If it had been set in a city I am not familiar with perhaps I could have enjoyed it through ignorance , but it 's not a high quality film so I just couldn't bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it is . I would have given it 0/10 if such a rating existed ! Possibly the most disappointing film I ever thought I would like .  
  For some reason , in the late 70 's and early 80 's the local CBS affiliated station in New York kept playing this movie in it 's late-night slot on Friday or Saturday nights for several years , usually at 2 a . m . or some such time . It 's a fitting movie for that time slot since it 's really hard to follow and quite odd ( see the other reviews for specific story info ) . Anyway , after catching it numerous times in those days just before cable TV ( And even after it hit but before they offered much all night programming ) , I kept catching this little oddity . After not seeing it for many years I decided to see if I could find it on DVD . Well , it is only available ( from every search i 've conducted anyway ) in a pretty lousy grainy print on the budget label " Brentwood Video " as part of a 4-pack of movies ( 4 movies on 2 double sided discs ) called " Alien Worlds " if anyone is interested . It 's usually available for around $ 10-but even much less if you shop around . The other 3 movies on this set are readily available in numerous other collections of public domain movies , so no need to comment on them here . But I haven't seen " Eyes " available anywhere else . Though hardly a " restored " version in any way , this print runs exactly 92 minutes , so for once IMDb 's stated running time of 90 minutes is not correct . Even with the 92 minute running time it 's not unusual for a movie dubbed into English from another language to also have some of the running time trimmed . It seems to be a common budget-conscience practice to sometimes save money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered to be important to the story . Would a longer version make in any less confusing ? Who really knows-unless you 've seen it in it 's native language .. By the way , my attempts to watch this during the day don't work and I end up just turning it off . There 's something about watching this in the middle of the night that just fits this movie .. or maybe it 's just from my earlier experiences , who know ?  
  " Fungicide " is quite possibly the most incompetent , embarrassing , pitiful " film " I have ever seen . The acting is criminal , the direction practically non-existent , and the special effects presumably put together by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenceless laptop computer . Far be it from me to stifle creativity , but I actually believe things like this shouldn't be made . I am sure the " film " - makers will say that , yes , the " film " was hampered by a low ( as in nothing ) budget - but in that case they just really shouldn't have bothered . As it is , they have offered the world something so dire , so execrable , that only imbeciles could get the merest shade of enjoyment from it . Starting the " movie " it wasn't as though I was expecting " Citizen Kane " or anything . I was expecting a low budget little horror with perhaps a modicum of inventiveness , a hint of fun , and even some energy . What I got was the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchief . The plot ? Well , our leering antihero scientist , who works in his parents ' basement , is seen manically stirring some goo in a cup . Apparently , such high-level science is the end-result of years of research . His parents then send him off to a strange hotel-type place in the countryside to relax . There are some other people there , who are simply too awful to write about . Anyway , the scientist drops his test-tube onto some mushrooms - and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people . ( Wow , I 'm getting suicidal just writing the plot summary ) . Our heroes save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar ( by attaching a " fuse " - really a piece of string - to it ) . The barrel unaccountably explodes with the power of a small nuclear weapon , destroying all the mushrooms . The end . ( Thank goodness ) . That summary is as good as the " film " gets ( and actually makes it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is ) . It really should never have got past this stage of development ( by which I mean a plot outline scribbled on the back of an envelope with crayons ) . Somebody should have really stepped in and given someone a vigorous shake and said " NO . " And those " special " effects . Well , they 're " special " all right . This is CGI gone crazy . And done by a person who I can only assume believes the bicycle pump to be the pinnacle of modern technology . And when the mushroom monsters are not in the style of a 1984 home computer graphics package , they are represented by actors shuffling along covered in a sheet ( I kid you not ) . One of the most inexcusable things about the movie is its laziness . This can be summed up by the scene in which the hero spins his guns ( a la Clint Eastwood ) and then fails miserably to get them in his pockets . I mean come on , a couple of retakes and he could have pulled it off , but just to leave it as it is - really weak . I cannot believe money was spent on this camcorder-shot rubbish . The " film " - makers should hang their heads in shame and be banned from going within fifty metres of any movie-making equipment . I also think it 's wrong that friends and family of the makers come onto IMDb and post mendacious reviews and give stupidly high user ratings which give a totally inaccurate picture of the " movie . " " Fungicide " is an absolute travesty of film-making . Mr Wascavage is either very , very stupid or very , very cynical .  
  So let me start off by saying that I saw this movie as part of a bargain . I was really bored one fine 1997 day and so I biked over to the movie rental store . I asked the clerk what the worst movie he had in stock was . Without hesitation he walked me over to " Lucky Stiff . " He told me that he 'd waive the $ 1 rental fee ( he said it would be wrong to charge more ) if I promised to watch the whole movie . So watch it I did , for free .. This movie is terrible . God-Awful even . I don't need to go into plot details , read the other reviews . The jokes make no sense . The acting was terrible . I know it was supposed to be a comedy , but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting . You might try to watch it as something to laugh at , but it 's so bad that it isn't even funny in that way . Avoid !  
  I 've gotta say , I usually like horror movies that i 've never seen .. however , this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste . I 'm used to the gory , gut wrenching types .. but this particular movie was lame . The acting was horrible ( yet the corny ( no pun intended ) one-liners were cute ) . And the sequel to it , Scarecrow Slayer was even worse ! Yes , probably , when it first came out , there was a huge rave about it and people liked it . But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose come out , movies like these make movies like Scarecrow seem childish . If you want a movie to just pass the time , pick this one ! The special effects are cheesy as heck . But seeing that it was a low budget movie , I can kind of see where that would come in . This will kind of remind you of the movie " Children Of The Corn . " Independent movies rock .. most of the time . So if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs , or in the sequel , 2 scarecrows going at it , then these movies would be for you .  
  I saw this movie on the film festival of Rotterdam ( jan ' 06 ) and followed the discussion between director and public afterwards . Many people reacted shocked and protesting . He will get a lot of negative critics . But : the world is cruel like this , and it 's not funny . People don't like it . That itself doesn't mean that the movie is bad . I can see that difference . Don't shoot the messenger that shows us the world outside our ' hubble ' ! Nevertheless I think this a bad movie . Film-technically it 's a good one . Nice shots and script , most good fitting music , great actors . The director pretends to make a psychological movie , - the psychology however is of poor quality . Describing such a powerful violence itself is not the art . The art would be a powerful description of the psychological process behind that violence . How does a shy boy come to such a cruelty ? The director pretends to describe that , - but is not good in that . The director used several times the word the ' selfishness ' of people , mentioning for instance the teacher . Only : this teacher wasn't selfish , - just someone in several roles , caring for his pupils , ánd worried about his script . I think it 's a simplification to call him selfish . The atmosphere in the village is creepy , and the mother made awful mistakes ( ' you terribly let me down ' ) but it doesn't become believable for me , that there is caused súch a lot of pain , that the shyest boy comes to such terrible things . In fact , reality is far more complex than the way , this film describes  and it needs far better descriptions . The interesting thing would be : how does it work ? Describe that process for me please , so that we understand . With the written phrase on the end , the director said to point to an alternative way of life . It was the other extreme , and confirmed for me that director and scriptwriter are bad psychologists , promoting black / white-thinking . The connection between violence in films and in society has been proved . Use such a violence gives the responsibility to use it right . There are enough black / white-thinkers in the world , causing lots of war and misery . I hope , this movie won't be successful .  
  Something very strange happens when you talk about Global Warming : science goes out the window and " belief " and " consensus " becomes the topic of discussion . It 's because of that fact that I give a failing mark to Al Gore 's documentary . Instead of promoting intelligent discussion , he kept the debate at the level of " belief " and " consensus " . Of course , when you 're trying to sell the world into spending trillions of dollars to " stop Global Warming " you may thing it 's a problem to tell the scientific truth : we don't know how much of the current warming was caused by humans . Maybe none of it , maybe some of it , or maybe it has over-ceded the next Ice Age and we got really lucky not to have boiled the planet . But the fact remains that we don't know . so we 're asked to " believe " in the " consensus " . Never mind that any scientist that strays from the " consensus " is ostracized . Never mind that scientific inquiry is about straying from the consensus . Einstein didn't " believe " in the consensus , neither did Copernicus or Galileo . So why so much scorn placed on those very researchers who would advance the field by asking the tough questions ? If Global Warming is so incontrovertible , surely a few people testing that theory can't be so threatening . What is going on here ? That 's the movie I was hoping Al Gore would have made . Istead , he chose to shore up his support with the true " believers " of the " consensus " . Sad , really .  
  The acting in this movie stinks . The plot makes very little sense , but from what I gathered it 's supposed to be about this scientist who develops the ability to turn people 's personal items into tiny steel balls that then fly into their mouths and turn them into zombies ( or blow their heads up , whichever ) . And the effects are lousy , too . Most of the movie consists of bad music , with the actors dancing equally as badly to the bad music , interspersed with multiple boring sex scenes . This should be one of the worst things ever made , but for one thing . One element of shear brilliance that makes " Nightmare Weekend " stand above all others . And that special quality is the presence of George . George is the lovable interface device between the scientist 's daughter , Jessica , and the home computer security system . With his green hair and nose , balding scalp , and heart-shaped mouth , George is the guardian angel / confidant to Jessica , who asks him for advice on how to meet guys in one of the most dramatic pieces of dialogue ever captured on celluloid . With his monotone synthesized voice , George tells Jessica what percentages of males prefer women in white dresses , and also that hitch-hiking is the third best way to meet guys after discos and bars . Of course , little Jessica just can't seem to stay out of trouble , causing George to execute " Emergency Program Code : Protection Jessica " , which results in the violent death of Jessica 's would-be assailant via one of the aforementioned steel balls . Kubrick was an utter fool for thinking he could give a computer personality using closeups of a red light . HAL should have been represented by our friend George in order to better translate compassion for his eventual demise . The light and sound show at the end of " Close Encounters " ? Not bad , but how much better would that movie had been if the means of first communication with the aliens had been George the Hand Puppet . Bishop , Data , R2  kitchen appliances next to the Almighty George ! He might only be in the movie for 8 minutes out of 90 , but don't be fooled . This show is all about George . With even that limited amount of screentime , George joins the ranks of such luminous film characters as Hollywood Montrose , Majai , and Pappy from " New Moon Rising " as icons of American cinema . " George to Apache "  you are my hero .  
  If the myth regarding broken mirrors would be accurate , everybody involved in this production would now face approximately 170 years of bad luck , because there are a lot of mirrors falling to little pieces here . If only the script was as shattering as the glass , then " The Broken " would have been a brilliant film . Now it 's sadly just an overlong , derivative and dull movie with only just a handful of remarkable ideas and memorable sequences . Sean Ellis made a very stylish and elegantly photographed movie , but the story is lackluster and the total absence of logic and explanation is really frustrating . I got into a discussion with a friend regarding the basic concept and " meaning " of the film . He thinks Ellis found inspiration in an old legend claiming that spotting your doppelganger is a foreboding of how you 're going to die . Interesting theory , but I 'm not familiar with this legend and couldn't find anything on the Internet about this , neither . Personally , I just think " The Broken " is yet another umpteenth variation on the theme of " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " but without the alien interference . " The Broken " centers on the American McVey family living in London , and particularly Gina . When a mirror spontaneously breaks during a birthday celebration , this triggers a whole series of mysterious and seemingly supernatural events . Gina spots herself driving by in a car and follows her mirror image to an apartment building . Whilst driving home in a state of mental confusion , she causes a terrible car accident and ends up in the hospital . When dismissed , Gina feels like her whole surrounding is changing . She doesn't recognize her own boyfriend anymore and uncanny fragments of the accident keep flashing before her eyes . Does she suffer from mental traumas invoked by the accident or is there really a supernatural conspiracy happening all around her ? Writer / director Sean Ellis definitely invokes feelings of curiosity and suspense in his script , but unfortunately he fails to properly elaborate them . " The Broken " is a truly atmospheric and stylish effort , but only after just half an hour of film , you come to the painful conclusion it shall just remain a beautiful but empty package . There 's a frustratingly high amount of " fake " suspense in this film . This means building up tension , through ominous music and eerie camera angels , when absolutely nothing has even happened so far . By the time the actually mysteriousness kicks in , these tricks don't have any scary effect on you anymore . Some of my fellow reviewers around here compare the film and particularly Sean Ellis ' style with the repertoires of David Lynch , Stanley Kubrick and even Alfred Hitchcock , but that is way , way  WAY too much honor . PS : what is up with that alternate spelling ; the one with the Scandinavian " ø "  
  In spite of sterling work by the supporting actors , and an intelligent script by Alan Plater , this film suffers from a fatal flaw - the lack of charm of the central character / actor . One of the characters describes Richard E Grant 's character as " a whining little turd " and unfortunately this sums him up perfectly . There is nothing about him or his performance to make it credible that his girlfriend and upper-class publisher / friend would spend so much time and emotional effort on him . He is rude , arrogant , selfish , self-destructive and thoroughly annoying . The part called for an actor who can make you love him even when he is being a prate - a Ewan McGregor , for example . All of the witty satire on the class system etc was wasted , thanks to this irritating and thoroughly unlikeable performance . All I wanted to do was shake him and tell him to get over himself .  
  Well it 's not often that we in the UK have a film made about inner city life from the perspective of the Afro Caribbean community , the last example that I can remember was the underrated Babylon way back in 1980 . So I had high expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy , a film that has been touted as the British version of La Haine ! Well La Haine it is not ! I agree that the use of dialogue and environment gives this film an authenticity that has been missed in other British films of late , but my concern is that this film predictably ends sadly . The film intelligently deals with the escalating problem of black on black violence that is sadly all to common in London , but I 'm concerned that film makers now use type-casting in plot as opposed to characters which is equally as damaging . Saul Dibb had a great opportunity to make a film that could be both entertaining and inspirational to us all , but sadly missed and created a film that only reinforces the idea that to be a young black male in London the only future is violence & tragedy  
  This movie is a bad memory from my childhood . This is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you can't go out for recess , and you 'd rather be watching anything , ANYTHING else . At least that 's what it was like when I was in elementary school . I just remember HATING this movie . Granted , I haven't seen it in 15 years or so , and they probably don't use it on rainy days anymore but I just want to warn everyone : You 'd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them . Trust me , pick anything else . Even though the topic is kind of controversial , the plot is so tame and slow that I can't remember anything about it except that I disliked it so strongly that here , 15 years later , I felt the need to warn all of you against it .  
  The Good Earth is not a great film by any means , it is way to ordinary . Maybe it was different in the 1930 's but who would want to see the life of a farmer . It is not very interesting to me . Yes , Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long . I could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act . In short Wang Lung ( Muni ) a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him . Both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds . The film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next . Also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments , it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis .  
  Fans of goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis should look elsewhere if they are picking up this film for his usual buckets of blood being sloshed about , for there is precious little in the way of bloodletting in this film . Instead , Lewis decides to try and tell the bizarre story , relying on bargain-basement special effects on a budget which could have probably been doubled if the cast had turned out their pockets for change one day . Oddly enough , while cheap and very poorly acted ( especially by McCabe as Mitchell ) , the total outlandishness of the plot keeps attention throughout . Imagine what this film could have been like with a decent budget ! Overall , it strains for champagne tastes on a beer budget .  
  A broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent ( Tom Wood and Arye Gross ) are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager ( Ron Perlman ) whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city , the " Costume Killer " ( so named because , after injecting his victims with Windex , he dresses them in silly costumes ) . They convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers ( John Considine , Joe Pantoliano , Kristy Swanson ) and discover that the art of movie making can be murder . There is more to this movie but it was unfortunately left on the editing room floor and it shows ( rumor is the studio wanted a " lighter " dark comedy ) . Our loss ( and the actors , who all do fine jobs and deserve better ) as this has the makings of an exceptional black comedy but only rises to mediocre cute . If you 're a Ron Perlman fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance . His comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions ( he wasn't kidding when he said on the Hellboy movie commentary that he needed an intervention when he gets into Jerry Lewis mode ) . He 's just simply fun to watch in this one . David Dukes also shines in a two-scener ( but pivotal ) role .  
  First of all , if you'r a fan of the comic , well , you 'll be VERY disappointed I 'm sure ! Low budget movie ! Largo is supposed to be Serbian in the comic , now suddenly he becomes croatian , pff ! chicken producers , it gave some spice and guts to the comic ( By the way , in the film , his father speaks Serbian and he speaks croatian .. Lol ) . The striking N.Y. Winch building becomes a common average-small yacht in H.K. The good looking Largo becomes some unshaved Tzigan / Turkish looking guy . Freddy the cool ' scarface ' pilot becomes some fat , out of shape , sad , average guy . Simon , Largo 's good buddy , does not exist at all ! ? He gave some pepper ! Largo doesn't throw knifes at all , but just some snake stares .. The whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious TV-film . French directors and producers , if you don't have the money , the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic , please stick to some romance shooted in Paris . Very very bad film , good thing I just rented it , don't count on me to watch the sequel ( If there is any ! ) .  
  I had such high hopes for this film because I loved the original so much . It seems that Disney , however , is trying to perfect the art of crappy straight-to-DVD sequels . They deserve a razzie . Several , in fact . I thought the idea had merit , but the music was absolutely awful and the story wasn't much better . What happened to the great music Disney used to have in their films . Mary Poppins , Aladdin , Beauty and the Beast , The Lion King .. even Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame . They 've made so many great movies over the years that it 's really sad that they 've sunk to point of making sequels that aren't even good enough to put in theatres . I hope this movie is not an indication of things to come for the Walt Disney Corporation .  
  Unless you are geeky film student who has to see everything , this film will not only be a waste of your time and money and a huge disappointment , but it will also make you angry beyond belief . There might be a story worth telling somewhere inside , but Hopkins decided to hide it and encode under so many incessant chaotic layers of apparently random audio video microcuts , making the viewer 's patience run thin after a very short while . Why would someone like Hopkins choose such a heavy , most difficult and highly unstable project as his first script , first score and third film can by anyones guess . Maybe he played with it in his mind for such a long time until it became unrecognizable as what it became , not even for himself . The result proves that he has by far not enough experience or skill to achieve the desired result . Even the weirdest Carpenter and Lynch films , to name just two uncoventional filmmakers , had 90 % more coherence , 95 % less characters and 99 % more story flow . Sir Anthony you aimed for the stars , but unfortunately missed by a couple of light years . Please stick to acting , in that department you are a unequaled giant and nobody should ask more from you , not even yourself !  
  Surely no Saturday morning TV kids ' show was ever done this poorly . After all , those producers had to count on the audience coming back . Well , in this awful offering , they could at least count the money they saved on sets . The script could have been a reject from some long-forgotten space opera serial , with a few smarmy lines added for cool-dude Gerald Mohr to murmur to Naura Hayden . No director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline , so the action just plods boringly along . The spaceship props are absurd-a Bulova wall clock and portable typewriter , for example-but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history . Most are crude drawings , and it 's all bathed in an often misfocused red light . Even Mohr 's bare hairy chest is used as a prop . And it 's a bad one-as rib-thin as the plot . Any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the Martians-and will probably agree completely !  
  Really , They spelled it BRAIN in the credits , not BRIAN . OK , they didn't have the budget for a spell checker . All the production money went for great old cars . There are at least two Packards visible here . One is a Darin Convertible . A nice yellow Packard convertible . The scenes of the movie studio show that there was some money spent for costumes and set decorations . Old Cameras , an exterior of Ciro 's , street signs and whatever was needed to make a visually pleasing picture was there . Poorly written and directed . My DVD says it runs for 104 minutes , approximately . It was more like 85 minutes . It came to an end without reaching a conclusion . There was a collision but no conclusion . The movie just smashed up against the credits . 99 cents for this . I paid 99 cents for this . I could have bought 3 cans of cat food and watched my cat 's face as he emoted more excitement . For a few seconds in the Ciro 's scene after Darren McGavin gets a phone call , it looked like , maybe .. this movie would have a surprise twist that would make for an interesting film . Then it just sat there . The young Latin actor played by Steven Bauer ( Tony Montoya ) could have had a much bigger part in all that was going on here . This cast could have made a good film . I think if they cut Brian 's part and use Steven Bauer in his place and change the script and keep the Packards and lose the band and add a Johnny Otis sound alike band , then they got something . Here Kitty , Kitty .. Tom Willett  
  I don't quite get the rating for The Amati Girls and I think I was REALLY kind giving it a 4 out of 10 . What could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors became a total farce in my eyes . There are so many clichés in that flick , the women 's hair is just awful and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake . There 's no real passion in this movie but a bunch of actors over-acting over any limits that it hurts . It 's not funny enough to be a comedy , it 's too fake-sad to really touch , so in my eyes it 's just not good . Watching it I couldn't believe how something like that made it to my TV set in my living room in Switzerland . But .. maybe it still was OK and it just got lost in translation ? Who knows . Definitely one of the oddest movies I 've ever seen and this certainly not in a good way ! Sorry .  
  This gets a two because I liked it as a kid , but it became so redundant that I just started to hate it .. I can't give this a descriptive review because it would be restating one thing after the other , I probably wouldn't say anything that everyone else didn't say already . The only other thing about this show is that it 's pretty nasty , with the kid with the boil to that twisted babysitter to the stupidity that runs around and about in it . I have a cousin that loves this show and he 's the strangest and dumbest person I have met . This show should be pulled from the air . It 's always the same thing over and over .. They need to put better shows on Nick . I 'm getting really really tired of stuff like this .  
  this is just a terrible ' comedy ' - it really is a bad film . there are no funny elements . no jokes that are funny . i don't know how some people can claim this dismal short film could be ' smartest ' or ' quality . ' perhaps if its the only film that a person has seen you can make that claim of the brothers . but , i have seen thousands of better films : namely leonard part six ( now , that 's funny ) ! i don't know how the brothers is even considered eligible to be listed on the internet movie database : its more like a home video than an actual film . jokes aside , just skip this film . a root canal is more enjoyable that this cliche-ridden unfunny material .  
  But this movie was a bore . The history part was fine but the musical part was not . Not one song I cared about and no soundtrack to be heard . If Sweet Jesus " was suppose to be comic relief it never work . If John Adams was suppose to be the obnoxious annoying one , the rest of them were trying to overthrow him in every scene . Hancock and Jefferson were the only bearable characters in the whole movie . The historical quotes and the debate about slavery in their historical context were interesting enough but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical . Shouldn't you be humming the songs after a musical , except for a few chirps , nothing else was worth the breath .  
  Anyone who has seen ' Shine ' , Scott Hicks film of the heartbreaking yet ultimately joyful life of the pianist David Helfgotts ; will I am sure realise that ' The SOLOIST ' is very poor in comparison . It is as slow as a lullaby ( I took five breaks answering emails just to wake up ) . The depiction of the homeless area way over the top and extremely self indulgent , on a par I fear with the awful beach battle depiction in Joe Wrights other disaster Attonment . . J Fox performance was an extremely poor example of acting and lacked credibility from the offset . Downey on the other hand ; although struggling with a badly paced film , still manages to charm , 9Is it me or is he turning into George Clooney in more ways than one ? ) . Comparing both these well known so called ' STAR'actors though is unnecessary as the light that shines brightest as far as acting is concerned must be that of ' shine 's ' Geoeffry Rush who 's brilliant performance definitely SHONE far brighter in my sky . With both ' Attonment ' and ' The Soloist ' the written word wins far more prizes for empathy of subject . Read the book and articles or wait for the DVD its bound to be in the bargain basement soon .  
  The Comeback starts off looking promising , with a brutal death scene by a mask wearing killer . The mask itself is pretty cool too , and looks almost identical to the one used in the 1990 's slasher film " Granny " . From then on the film is mostly boring . We get a few more deaths , which again are good , but there 's not enough of them . The reason the deaths are so good is because they are frenzied and bloody . The story behind the film is actually rather interesting and would have worked very well had it not been so boring for the most part . I would avoid this unless you 're a die-hard collector - there 's not enough here to even make it an average slasher flick .  
  Feh . This movie started out in an interesting manner , but quickly ran the gamut from confusing to dull . The confusing parts happened mostly at the beginning , where the cut scenes are so numerous that its hard to tell just what is going on for the first twenty minutes or so . The dull comes later , with a tepid romance between the two living people ( pusses both ) . The vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most lively person in the film , which is sad . If the rest of the cast had been up to her caliber , the movie might have been better . Maybe . Because the storyline gets really interesting for awhile , as it appears that the insane priestess mother of the dead sixteen year old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from the dead , with the decidedly unfortunate side effect that all of the other dead people would come back as well , take on solid human form , and most likely start killing off everybody . A sort of Japanese mystical Night of the Living Dead type thing . But this doesn't come to pass . Even though this hairy unwashed priest with a tiny basket strapped to his head tells the uninteresting young people that this will come to pass if the priestess finishes her ritual , she does just that and the only dead person who manifests is her daughter . No mass rising of the dead , no walking army of corpses , nothing . The priest merely makes the girl 's spirit go back to the land of the dead , taking the washed out wuss of a boyfriend with her , as she 'd crushed his spine like peanut brittle ( at which point I was tempted to cheer loudly , as this idiot went over to kiss and fondle the DEAD girl , eww ! ) . The Robitussen sucking , spineless best friend has a long introspective shot at the end as she leaves the village for the last time , and that 's it . No real horror , no real creepiness , which the Japanese tend to do far better than American film makers with their emphasis on over-the-top cheesy face make-up , no screaming mimis . I was very disappointed .  
  OK , admittedly as an Orthodox woman who LIVES in Boro Park , I 'm going to be a little biased against this film . However , it seemed that Boaz Yakin 's sole purpose in making this film was Orthodox-bashing . With our wigs , modest attire , and separate seating , we 're a pretty easy target already . Yakin never made it past the surface . The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese : 1 . Yosi tells Sonia off for loving him more than G-d or their parents . Then he deliberately defies his father 's order that he not go swimming because of his poor health . 2 . Sonia flips out at her son 's bris . Why would a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction ? It 's hard to believe that she never attended one before . Let 's face it , even Reform Jews hold bris milah ceremonies nowadays . 3 . Was Mendel sleeping during his chosson classes ? He 's supposed to satisfy his wife 's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street . Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park ! 4 . Sonia and Mendel had to have been married for over a year , and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other ? A little clue-arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents set her up with . Nor will she be shunned by the community if the marriage doesn't work out . 5 . If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business that badly , she did not have to go through her lecherous brother-in-law . There are Orthodox female doctors , lawyers , teachers , etc . Sonia came off as more whiny than sympathetic . Instead of taking control of her life , she sat back and waited for things to happen , and then complained that she didn't like the outcome . That 's not standing up to one 's environment ; that 's pandering to stereotype . Frankly , I think she got what she deserved .  
  Kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes , only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film I 've ever seen . Sort of like a high school film project . What was Rosanna Arquette thinking ? And what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed Midwest town ? Pretty hard to get involved with this one . No lessons to be learned from it , no brilliant insights , just stilted and quite ridiculous ( but lots of skin , if that intrigues you ) videotaped nonsense .. What was with the bisexual relationship , out of nowhere , after all the heterosexual encounters . And what was with that absurd dance , with everybody playing their stereotyped roles ? Give this one a pass , it 's like a million other miles of bad , wasted film , money that could have been spent on starving children or Aids in Africa ..  
  If this movie were any worse , it would have been directed by Uwe Boll . This nonsensical mess makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock . It has been a while since I have seen this steaming pile , but I do remember that I wanted to do grievous bodily harm to all those involved . How anyone can give this movie any more than 1 star amazes me to the graciousness of all those that viewed this tripe . I give it one star because there is not a rating lower . All copies of this movie should be burned the ground sowed with salt and reserved as a landfill for the most toxic of waste . No , one copy should be kept under ultra hi security and shown only to film makers as an example of how not to do it .  
  Without a doubt one of the worst movies I 've seen in recent years . The story focuses on four women driven to robbing banks who we are somehow supposed to sympathize with . It 's tough to sympathize with characters who keep making such stupid decisions . Oh no , the cops are on to us , they know who we are , what do we do ? .. Let 's rob one more bank then we 're outta here ! What ! ? ! Every character is a stereotype and it 's easy to tell who 's gonna end up dead .  
  I watched this movie also , and altho it is very well done , I found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children .. The terror on this mother 's face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking . And the sad thing is-internally she dies . Eventually she goes back to the Applacian mountains . All the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has . I remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed . I 'm surprised this movie takes place in Detroit , because when I watched it I thought for sure the people had come to Cincinnati , Ohio . This also was a route for the poor from the mountains .  
  The plot is about a female nurse , named Anna , is caught in the middle of a world-wide chaos as flesh-eating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living . She escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer . So far , so good ! I usually enjoy horror movies , but this piece of film doesn't deserve to be called horror . It 's not even thrilling , just ridiculous . Even " the Flintstones " or " Kukla , Fran and Ollie " will give you more excitement . It 's like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more liquor . The heroes who has locked themselves in , inside the shopping-mall to avoid being eaten by the hoodlums outside , are not better either . Even though they doesn't seem to be drunk , they give the impression of being mentally disabled . Save your money instead of spending it on this !  
  What a horrible movie . I cannot believe i wasted 90 mins of my life watching this re-make . Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer starred in this film ? Mehki Pfifer is great in E.R and Ving Rhames probably didn't know what he was doing . I feel terrible for them . The music background i must say did not fit AT ALL with the story and it 's amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no lives in creating a well and balanced film . I hope that in the future no director as horrible as this one was , could ever distroy such a great classic film . This film should not have been made in the first place . An advice to everyone who has seen it , please tell me that i 'm right because i couldn't possibly be the only viewer who did not enjoy it . BOO ! - 10 out of 10 .  
  Watching Smother was perhaps the longest not-quite-90-minutes of my life . There wasn't a laugh to be had ; in fact , I don't remember ever cracking a smile . Diane Keaton was horridly unfunny as a middle-aged chain-smoking dog hoarder , the textbook overbearing mother character , a relentlessly irritating woman who clearly suffers from some kind of personality disorder . She is manipulative , conniving , melodramatic , childish , narcissistic , and worst of all , boring . I suppose I should briefly mention the other characters , but why bother ? It was just a long string of movie clichés-the dippy , socially inept distant relative who 's just trying to break into " The Industry " , the gruff and long-suffering but somehow still lovable father , the mild - mannered wife who just can't take it anymore ( but eventually moves beyond the discord and resignedly comes home ) , the herd of unhousebroken dogs who like to chew throw pillows while everyone is away , etc . God , what a snore . I 've never been a Diane Keaton fan and Smother only reminded me why . Overacting is overacting , no matter how many pictures you did in your prime . Her attempts at physical comedy were especially humiliating . What was the director thinking ? While I like Dax Shepard and can even sometimes tolerate Liv Tyler , their performances were so lackluster and dull that it was clear that neither actor gave a damn about this movie . That was okay , because neither did I . Keaton 's endless self-absorbed prattling was intolerable and at times Shepard 's dislike for her seemed genuine . By the end of the movie I wanted to slap her myself . Awful .  
  What made me track this movie down was the viewing Vampyres , I thought I have to get the other movies this guy ( Larroz ) has made , I was sorry I tracked this down , it is a weak attempt at an occult / satanic type movie laden with sex and only sex ( with ugly actors and actresses , this is an excuse for sleaze . The only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere , avoid this one , too much hype surrounds it , not worth the effort of finding it , this refers to the welcome to the grind house edition . I hope he has some other movies which lives up to Vampyres , Oh and the goat scene was very boring , I understand that this is what carries the hype .  
  The guy did a lot of title design for a bunch of movies and I guess one day he said ; I should pick a cheap scenario , try to put as much title in it as a can ( cause after all i 'm a title designer ) and try to persuade people that this is in fact a movie . One of the worst i 've even seen that 's for sure . If you fell the urge to see nice titles , go check out some posters don't waste your time watching this . It kinda ironic don't you think , did you saw the poster ? the only part of his project that SHOULD had title work done have almost none !  
  Race car drivers say that 100 mph seems fast till you 've driven 150 , and 150 mph seems fast till you 've driven 250 . OK . Andalusian Dog seems breathtakingly bizarre till you 've seen Eraserhead , and Eraserhead seems breathtakingly bizarre till you 've seen Begotten . And Begotten seems breathtakingly bizarre till you 've seen the works of C . Frederic Hobbs . Race fans , there is NOTHING in all the world of film like the works of C . Frederic Hobbs . Alabama 's Ghost comes as close as any of his films to having a coherent plot , and it only involves hippies , rock concerts , voodoo , ghosts , vampires , robots , magicians , corrupt multinational corporations , elephants and Mystery Gas . And the Fabulous Woodmobile , cruising the Sunset District in San Francisco , of course . What 's really startling is that somebody gave him a LOT of money to make Alabama 's Ghost . There 's sets , lighting , hundreds of extras , costumes , lots and lots of effects . Somehow that makes Alabama 's Ghost SO WRONG . You watch some awful cheeseball like Night of Horror or Plutonium Baby , and at least some part of the weirdness is excusable on the basis that they were obviously making the film off the headroom on their Discover cards . But Alabama 's Ghost was made with an actual budget , and that 's EVIL . I mean , I 've got a script about a tribe of cannibals living in Thunder Bay , Ontario , building a secret temple in the woods out of Twizzlers , and nobody 's beating down MY door waving a checkbook - how did this guy get the funds for FOUR of the flakiest movies ever made ?  
  The producers of this film offer to pay funeral expenses for anyone who dies of fright while watching this movie . They should have offered intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoyed this stinker . A young couple moves into a house , where a woman who looks like the woman from the couple lived . Extremely boring , and very predictable . In the end I ended up not caring about anyone in this movie . Avoid this one at all costs .  
  Before watching this film I had very low expectations and went to just see the cars . Eventually I even regretted going for that reason . Plot is almost non-existent . Character development is non-existent . So many clichés and so much jaw-dropping cheesiness existed in the movie that I could only stare and wonder how it was even released . If not for the exotics , I wouldn't have even rated this movie a 1 . An attempt at a coherent story line is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and the laughable characters that make up its members . In fact , the movie 's plot is so predictable and simple-minded that an average child could foretell the majority of the storyline . Bad acting , bad plot , bad jokes , bad movie . Don't see it . Play Gran Turismo HD instead and it 'll satiate your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste .  
  This film has all the earmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stew . Based on Shielah Graham 's autobiography , it seems like the powers that be couldn't leave well enough alone . They couldn't decide if this was to be Graham 's story or Fitzgerald 's story , and also how much they should soft-pedal whoever 's story it turned out to be . So a film that could have been a story about two fascinating ( Fitzgerald ) and notorious ( Ms . Graham ) personalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either . Added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for 1959 . Clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing . However - and this saved the film for me - Kerr has never looked lovelier , and Peck is as always a very handsome man . They truly make a beautiful , mature couple , and I only wish they had better material to work with . There is one scene that does work - Scott goes after Shielah while in a drunken state , and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs . Other than that , the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other Wald produced soaps of the 1950 ( PEYTON PLACE , THE BEST OF EVERYTHING ) .  
  No matter how well meaning his " message " is - this film is a terribly made trainwreck - awful acting , lame camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is lousy at it . You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention . He is a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer . Some how Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is choppy , predictable and sappy .  
  OK . I think the TV show is kind of cute and it always has some kind of lesson involved . So , when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie , I decided to tag along . I wish I 'd stayed home and watched the TV show instead . The fact that the humor is silly and unoriginal is the least of the problems with this movie . The plot is next to non-existant , the characters seem to exist in a vacuum , and , worst of all , Gadget does not carry any lesson whatsoever . It appears that Disney took all of the things that make Inspector Gadget work on TV and tossed them all . To be fair , my younger child ( 8 years old ) liked the movie but the older one ( 10 years old ) came away thinking it silly ( he was too old for the youth humor but too young for any of the adult humor ) . Generally , I like Disney films but this one misses by a mile . It is OK for a very narrow age band ( say 7 to 9 ) but a must miss for everybody else .  
  Where do they get the money to make films like this ? I mean , there 's nothing redeeming about this film . None of the actors are known , the writing is terrible , the photography is blurry , the story wanders between being a bad version of Repo Man and a nicklodeon western and the acting is unbelievable . For someone who watches all kinds of film , good and bad , I must admit that this film is about the worst I 've seen since Attack of the Eye People back in the 50 's . I don't really like to trash the effort of people trying to create some entertainment or , heaven forbid , art but this film would seem to appeal to no one . The story bends on a mystical contamination of a person who 's a bad version of the Celtic Soul eater , although he functions more like a male succubus without the sexual overtones . The bad guys have to team up with the good guys in a town where they are unable to escape from . Take it from there as that , alas , is the best part . My advice is that unless you are into bad mythology , amateurish writing , unconvincing acting and tedious settings , you will best be served by leaving this one on the shelf when you 're out renting videos .  
  After reading the other reviews for this film I am of the opinion that the high markers are probably paid studio lackeys as the film I saw was absolutely dire , with wooden acting , lacklustre scripting and plodding predictable directing , one of the few plus points has to be the stunning scenery as this film features some stunning backdrops with great sweeping vistas and dramatic skies and wide open prairies , sadly when the most memorable thing in a film is the part featured behind the actors this has to be a warning sign as to the quality of the movie , all in all a thoroughly uninspiring addition to the western genre which even at the very reasonable price it can be obtained on DVD is best to avoid .  
  This movie is simply far too long , far too repetitive , with the male nudity and sexuality being ( as this is said as a gay with my own collection of adult titles ) far too gratuitous and unnecessary . Much of the first third of the movie could have been cut down to ten minutes and been equally as effective without trying the patience ( and stamina ) of an audience . I saw this movie on an early Saturday afternoon , with a film festival audience ; the type of crowd that tends to be more adventuresome , interested in more experimental or atypical films , such as one without much dialog , shorts , foreign films . The near sell out crowd in an approximate 275 seat theater started to dribble out within the first half of the movie and while the great majority did stay for the " pay off " ( which never actually arrived ) , I have never , in about 14 years of attending any number of film festivals , experimental , gay and otherwise , seen such a large number of people walk away from a film . This movie could easily have been cut down by more than half and been as effective as it was . It also could have gone in different directions , still with a shorter running time , and been far more effective . As it currently exists , this is not something that one can readily recommend or one I would have any desire to watch again .  
  The film is a bit tedious . It 's mostly a silent film , with the bulk o the story provided through a series of voice-overs . While making a silent film like this is not such a bad idea , this is one of those films where the lack of dialog and the repetitive early scenes make it simply tedious . You don't understand the reason for the tedium until well into the picture , and by then it 's too late . The first 40 minutes of film is something of a slow piece of Mexican soft porn , and unimaginative soft porn at that . Later in the film the style of the first 40 minutes starts to makes sense , but it 's too late , because by then the audience is lost . There is some nice location shooting at the National Autonomous University of Mexico . I 've often wondered why more films aren't shot there . The campus is built on the edge of lava fields that lend the campus a very otherworldly feel . My biggest problem with the film is that the director / writer has made the film the way he wanted to see it without regard for how a viewer who doesn't know the story will view it . You can't ignore the audience when you tell a story .  
  Facts about National Lampoon Goes to the Movies , a . k . a . National Lampoon 's Movie Madness : 1 . The movie is poor , even by Lampoon 's typical standards . 2 . It 's not funny . 3 . No one goes to see a movie . So , after I finished watching it , I began wondering why on earth it 's called ' National Lampoon Goes to the Movies , ' and why it was ever conceived , much less actually made . It would be like calling Austin Powers ' An American Guy Goes to the Movies . ' How lame . He isn't American , and he doesn't go to movies . None of the characters in Lampoon 's so-called ' satire ' are funny , and none go see movies , which causes a bit of a problem . I had hoped it would be something in the vein of Mystery Science Theater 3000 , but it isn't . This was National Lampoon 's first film after Animal House , although you couldn't tell it from the quality of film . Poorly developed , rough and amateurish by any standard , it induces headaches  not a good sign for an 89-minute movie that seems double the length . I 've noticed a pattern . Really bad movies are typically renamed  and this little disaster falls under that category . It has two separate titles - probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critics in 1982/83 . ' Hmm , Movie Madness  I 've never heard of this movie before ! Let 's rent it ! ' And then , the realization : ' Hey , wait a minute , this is just National Lampoon Goes to the Movies ! ' It was shelved by MGM / UA , never to be released into theaters or DVD ; it occasionally pops up on television a few times per decade , which is just about the only place you 'll manage to find it . It 's split up into three stories  a parody of self-enlargement videos , butter and corporate ruthlessness , and police brutality / cop-buddy films ( I guess ) . The first segment stars Peter Riegert ( Animal House ) as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff . I 'm not sure what because it was so boring my mind started to drift . Until the sex scene popped up . Part II is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter ( don't ask ) who decides to become Queen of the Margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products . Ouch ! This contains the only funny line in the movie : ' Only I can make love with my son ! ' If you think that doesn't sound very funny , you 're right  it 's not . And just imagine  it 's the highlight of this film ! Part II is about a cop who chases down a serial killer ( Christopher Lloyd ) only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy . It does contain one funny scene but it 's extremely over-acted  only Lloyd really exhibits any humor , playing his character dry and compassionate , yet strangely surreal . The part where he 's choking his victim and the meek cop stands by watching it all unfold , at least , evoked a chuckle or two . It 's a shame to watch such a cast of semi-famous names resort to low standards . The writers of each segment clearly believe that they 're being very ironic and clever by spoofing so-called stereotypes  the fault being that the movie becomes one huge contradiction , favoring the standard T & A instead of plot ; crude humor instead of witty dialogue ; desperate performances instead of inspired ones . It 's easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the material , muttering their lines , often so embarrassed they can seldom make eye contact with the camera . The movie isn't funny , as I said before . I laughed once , at only one line , and even then it was a halfhearted one . Two chuckles , a smile , and a very weak laugh . Compared to Movie Madness , a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracks . I like National Lampoon 's Vacation series ( or , at least three of four installments ) , and their classic Animal House , but their recent slew of direct-to-video bombs such as Golf Punks ( with that great comic genius Tom Arnold ) provide a good example of why their magazine went out of print more than a decade ago . It gets really old , really fast . Sad to see a new film , called Gold Diggers , is being released with their ' stamp of approval . ' It 's like condemning a film before it even hits theaters  maybe they should start not advertising their name all over the place Distributor : ' This movie is bad . It gets the National Lampoon stamp of approval . That 'll teach you not to make something so awful next time . ' Forget the death penalty . Just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch this over and over every day for a month . It 's so bad that I can't even begin to explain its putrid vileness . I give up .  
  In order to hold the public 's attention for three hours , we were treated not so much to a family 's romp through four generations and 120 years of Hungarian history , as to sexual liaisons with a sister , a sister-in-law and other adulteries . Oh yes , there was also a totally gratuitous rape . Having said all this , the first story of the relationship among the children of the patriarch was fresh and sensual - thanks to Jennifer Ehle .  
  Heavy-handed moralism . Writers using characters as mouthpieces to speak for themselves . Predictable , plodding plot points ( say that five times fast ) . A child 's imitation of Britney Spears . This film has all the earmarks of a Lifetime Special reject . I honestly believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo set out to create a thought-provoking , emotional film on a tough subject , exploring the idea that things are not always black and white , that one who is a criminal by definition is not necessarily a bad human being , and that there can be extenuating circumstances , especially when one puts the well-being of a child first . However , their earnestness ends up being channeled into preachy dialogue and trite situations planted to move the plot along . The decent production values and interesting use of documentary-style camera footage are not enough to accomplish their aim when the script and the acting fall flat . Logic is often compromised for the sake of creating tension : Soid first tries to blackmail Pablo into participating in her documentary in exchange for helping them escape , then in the same breath basically tells him not to trust her because she 's not helping them out of altruism . Well , duh . And for a man on the run , Pablo is far too swayed by a temper tantrum . Cristina 's well-being is so important to him that he 's fleeing capture and jail or deportation for her , but he 's willing to risk all that to appease her when she doesn't want to go to Mexico . Right . Talk above over-permissive parenting . Third , when Pablo 's employer Charlie gives the phone to Detective Bright , she is remarkably unprofessional , especially given her seniority - did she really think she was persuasive ? Oh , yeah , I would have turned myself in . CCH Pounder 's Detective Wims could wipe the floor with her . To be fair , I 'd like to list the things I liked . Um , I liked the midget . And I liked the fact that the midget was named Sexy . There 's cross-dressing , always a plus ; juvenile cross-dressing , no less ! Harry is infinitely cuter than Cristina . But my favorite moment in the film has to be when Cristina kicks Detective Not-So-Bright . I also find it interesting that , in a heavily minority cast ( which I much appreciate , by the way ) , the black character is the racist one . Too bad it 's just thrown out there and not further explored . There 's a distinctive , unconventional score , but it 's nonetheless generally context-unspecific , not enhancing mood or tension in any scene , except the pathetic , anguished wailing every time the main character is in anguish , as though they think his acting doesn't show it enough : ' Just in case you weren't sure , he 's upset , and we have the musical cues to prove it . ' Stilted , clichéd dialogue results in a depressing lack of subtext ; everything has to be spelled out in dialogue , even when the body language had been up ' til then conveying it just fine . For example , every impassioned speech Pablo makes , and Mrs . Knight 's lament that her child won't be crawling into bed with them in the morning . ' Papi , tell me about Mama again ' - what shameless , blatant exposition introducing the generic dead wife ! ( She 's always the most beautiful woman the widower had ever seen , the kindest he had ever met . Why can't we see a man cry over a woman like Shakespeare 's - she may be fat , ugly , obnoxious , but his love for her is deep as oceans ? Now _ there's _ a story which would move me . ) The police always being literally one step behind them gives many scenes the out-of-place feeling of a French farce . Most boring foot chases ever - Bright and Lightning are so out-of-shape and easily-fooled ( he certainly isn't quick as lightning , and she , well , I don't feel the need to spell things out ) . Some guy dragging along a small child outrunning a bicycle cop , complete with macho biker picking a fight but then being felled by a child ? To quote Margaret Cho , that 's so sad . Would we ever see this on ' Cops ' ? Hackneyed and over-the-top deus ex machina : as an employer , would you really waive checking his green card just because he can quote the author of the inspirational saying on a poster behind your desk ? Plus several scenes , including the above , threaten to devolve into porn : ' Well , I 'll do this favor for you , as long as you do something for me .. ' I can almost hear the bowm chicka bowm bowm . When the parents view the footage shot of Pablo 's remorse , the grieving mom 's freak-out is the most real the movie feels . Unfortunately , this is diminished by the fact that she looks completely swayed by his emotional speech right up until she goes ballistic . A more ambivalent look would be more convincing here . I 'm in constant awe of the stupidity of the main character doing things for the sake of plot : holding up a convenience store without a mask , visiting the dead girl 's grave . And why doesn't the mother recognize his face from when she saw him before he drove off ? ! ' You seem awfully familiar .. ' What is the purpose of that wholly unnecessary , somewhat gratuitous scene with Soid and the artificially-enhanced bartender ? Character development ? Tch . Too little , too late . Speaking of unnecessary traits that never went anywhere , Detective Lightning 's saying skeptical Detective Bright must be a Scorpio shows how little he really knows about the occult . And I don't think that believing in fate quite qualifies as voodoo mumbo jumbo . At the end , when Bright holds Pablo as he dies - wait , why does she care now ? Her character is as inconsistent as Soid 's . What , she has to shoot him just because she said ' Stop , or I 'll shoot ' ? ( She 's cared _ so_much _ about her integrity thus far . ) He was unarmed . There was no need for lethal force . What 's wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him ? Finally , Cristina 's childlike acceptance of her mother 's death giving Dr . Knight peace over his daughter 's death - so forced . And the contrivance of the family whose child was killed becoming Cristina 's new family .. It angers me that she could be a ' replacement ' for their little girl . It 's also unrealistic that a white couple would take in the Latino daughter of the man who killed their own daughter . I 'm not saying there aren't generous , loving people who would do that . I 'm just saying that the characters here are never developed far enough for me to believe that _ they _ would do that . I find it offensive that another IMDb reviewer said that of course as a woman she was moved by the sappy scenes . I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that don't wax sentimental in a manufactured manner . Co-writer , co-director , co-star Nebot said himself he wore too many hats during this production . Too many cooks may spoil the broth , but one cook alone just might end up making an after-school special . In conclusion , this film 's title has less to do with the story and more to do with the feeling of regret , helplessness , and loss accompanying the revelation that you will never see your money again .  
  This is the story of a young woman seduced and then dumped by her older , married lover after she gets pregnant ; she avenges herself against him , and his entire family , through black magic  which , disappointingly , she doesn't do herself but has someone else do for her . Good production values for a Thai horror flick . But the bland script never generates suspense , the director approaches the material entirely conventionally , and the final act loses viewer sympathy for the victims by throwing logic to the winds . At one point , a character has a prime opportunity to simply shoot the villainess dead , and instead she gets up and runs away without picking up the gun . Bad writing  you 're soaking in it ! Some icky gore effects , including a really tasteless late-term-fetus corpse and one guy dying from having hundreds of live eels burst out of his stomach . Only recommended for genre completists who simply have to see every horror film produced in Asia in the last 15 years .  
  Polyester was the very first John Water 's film I saw , and I have to say that it was also the " worst " movie I had seen up to that point . Water 's group of " talent " included several people who I am sure worked for food , and were willing to say the lines Waters wrote . Every thing about the movie is terrible , acting , camera , editing , and the story about a woman played by 300 lb transvestite Divine was purely absurd . That said , I have to recommend this film because it is very funny , and you won't believe the crap that happens to poor Francine . Her son huffs solvents and stomps unsuspecting women 's feet at the grocery store . Her daughter is the sluttiest slut in town . Her husband is a cackling A-hole of a pornographer who does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate poor Francine . Francine 's only friend is played by Edith Massey , possibly the worst actress ever . Edith looks and sounds like she is reading the lines off a cue card and has never seen the script prior to filming . Despite all of Francine 's travails , Waters cooks up a fabulous Hollywood ending and everyone ( who survives ) lives happily ever after .  
  The DVD was a joke , the audio for the first few minutes was terrible with sound out of sync and Segals voice not even his ! Pathetic ! When the audio sync was better in about 5 minutes the poor plot , lines and actors should get another job because the movie business is not where any of them should be . While Segal had some good movies in the early days the latest ones are a joke and should be a an embarrassment to him and the company that made it . If Segal was the one that handled this he better return to having another party run the show , because he has no talent what so ever in this . This film is a complete embarrassment to all involved in its production and a disgrace to all who viewed it . I turned it off in about 20 minutes . I will be asking for my money back at Block Buster ! Mark from Ontario , Canada  
  Well , on it 's credit side ( if it can be said to have one ) , Timothy Hines DID manage to capture the original setting of H.G. Wells ' outstanding novella . But other than that - well , to call a spade a spade - it sucks bigtime . What the Master Ed Wood could have done with the alleged $ 20 million dollar budget ! Timothy Hines really does make Mr . Wood , who was a flawed genius anyway , look like the best filmmaker of all time . The special effects ( I guess you 'd call them that ) are not even up to computer game standards . The acting is , well , perhaps about dinner theater comparable , and the accents are atrocious . At the risk of sounding offensive , a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is ( especially Poor Ogilvy ) , well , ahem , . . . GAY ! Poor Ogilvy minces and flounces about the bogus English countryside , waving his asbestos white handkerchief about as if it were heat resistant armor . Hey , the Stormtroopers in " Star Wars " had neat white body armor too , and it didn't work either , they still got blasted . Even when Ogilvy and Company get fried by the Martians ' ' Heat Ray ' ( ? ) , they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance , even when they 're theoretically DEAD and reduced to skeletons , which persist in unseemly dancing and writhing . Maybe Timothy Hines rented the skeletons from Ray Harryhausen , being left over from " Jason And The Argonauts " . Or was it " Josie And The Pussycats " ? I dunno . The soldiers , presumably because they 're ' military ' , all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode , like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him . Wow ! I loved it ! But the ' soldiers ' all looked like they were either fascist troops from the Spanish Civil War , or Boer Commandos ( which would be more or less correct for the period . Perhaps that was some bit of shrewd subtlety on the part of that wicked genius Hines ? ) . Oddly enough , the character of the Curate looks exactly like he 's drawn in the original illustrations by Warwick Goble , and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting . Oh , yeah . Musn't forget the THUNDER CHILD . In the book , the warship is described as an ironclad torpedo-ram . It was MEANT to RAM enemy ships . Yet , it 's bow was crumpled after ramming the Tinker-Toy constructed Martian War Machines , with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak , and she sank . An ironclad warship like THUNDERCHILD could 've rammed the TITANIC and survived , but I guess the Royal Navy was bound by the same lowest-bidder constraints as our own Military . The costumes are all wrong , especially the British Army and Police uniforms , cobbled together mostly from USMC Alphas . And Timbo , in an obvious homage to Western Films Of Yore , has obviously set his movie in Wild Western England , because all his riders are using western saddles . The accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of Scottish regional accent used by Clan Macabre , and magically delicious Irish accents from County Malarky . On the credit side , and contrary to what one reviewer wrote , the only genuine , authentic feature of this Thing is the artillery . The guns are not from the Civil War , but appear to my eye and research as bona-fide British nine or 12 pounder Rifled Breach Loaders , perfectly authentic to the period . So was the ammunition shown being used . But the Artilleryman , who is a driver in the Horse Artillery , was not shown correctly driving his limber . You don't sit on the frigging limber box and drive a gun team , you ride the nearside wheel horses . The Opening , using what I believe is authentic period film footage , is okay , and the score 's not bad . However , to the best of my knowledge Weybridge has never had an underground , and it certainly didn't in 1898 . But growing up reading this novel , I am very disappointed . Even more disappointed then I was at Spielberg 's zillion dollar , special effects laden version . Maybe his version would have profited by swapping Anthony Piana for Tom Cruise , and vice versa . I have a lot more to say , but I 'll let it go at this for now : I wish somebody would make a GOOD version of " War Of The Worlds " that 's faithful to the original . Timmy 's vision is fine for a high school film class , or maybe I should say pretentiously stupid for a college-level film student , and about as bad , which is about the best I can say for this thing , but that 's about it . Oh , yeah . Just where DID the budget go ? And what happened to Michael Caine ? I 'd like to hear HIS comments ! I have a sneaking suspicion that Timbo " Orson Wood " Hines ' breathtaking , bound-breaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risk-taking director 's ticket to cult stardom , because , I must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie , which I didn't pay for anyway but was thoughtfully sent to me by a friend who burned a DVD copy for me , with no malicious intent that I 've been able to determine . I must add here that I thought Blackmoon 's dubbed and abridged version was not only a vast improvement , but an absolute , hysterically funny ( in a good way ) treat to watch . I find it hard to watch Master Timbo 's version after Blackmoon . Keep it up , Tim ! Make your own version of " DUNE " , now . It just awaits the hand of a master like you ! And all you headupyourass snobs who hated Cloverfield ? FORGET IT . It CANNOT BEAT TIMBO HINES ARTISTRY FOR SHEER HILARIOUS AWFULNESS ! HEY GET A LIFE ! TIMBO IS WORSE THAN THE MASTER ED WOOD ! I KID YOU NOT !  
  An interesting idea involving an alternative dimension inside a hospital . It recalled - Stephen Kings " Langoliers " , " Kingdom Hospital " and old twilight zone episodes . Atmospherically strong , the set up was great . There were also some very clever ' time loop ' moments which always have that head-melt appeal . The story had plenty of vague references which led me to believe that all the ensuing weirdness of - time slips / ghosts / a weird bat winged demon and a rather silly heavy metal attired ghoul-thing would be explained . And THAT was were Dark Floors severely let me down . Based on my viewing the movie gives NO EXPLANATION as to what is behind the events . Whilst , some ambiguity is always expected / welcome in these kind of films . Dark floors took it to new heights of vagueness . I don't expect things wrapped up in a pretty ribbon , but neither should I be left feeling " Huh ? .. is that it ? .. Did I dose off ? Maybe , I hit chapter skip by mistake ? " Dark Floors left me with a deeply unsatisfying suspicion that " It was all a dream " which is a shame because up until the last reel I was very much on board and enjoying the movie .  
  Oh god , what a horrible , horrible film . Meant to be a comment on the state of society , it 's just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality TV . Interstitials hosted by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most obnoxious part , written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful . Rather , these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting , condescending speech that shoves the " meaning " of the film down the viewer 's throat . Also , a point to would-be filmmakers : Long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art . Neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity . If anyone out there is interested in watching this film , please don't . Seriously . Please . You have better things to do .  
  This movie was awful and an insult to the viewer . Stupid script , bad casting , endless boredom . In the usual tradition of Hollywood , the government of the US is shown as always evil . The Communist-sympathizer nitwits in Hollywood , most of whom are as dumb as a box of rocks , love taking the lone nutcase Eugene McCarthy and picturing him as the leader of a vast movement . The truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the Soviet Communists for political gain . Oh yeah , and the US brought over all those evil Nazis . Like Werner VonBraun , without whom we would have no space program . He actually loved being American and became a great asset to the country . And yet the irony is that the fools in Hollywood , an uneducated lot who live a fantasy existence , still believe that the government should run EVERYTHING and give us all what we want . And yet , this is the same government that they continually portray as a consummate evil in films like this .  
  If this film had a budget of 20 million I 'd just like to know where the money went . A monkey could make better CGI effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage , although I must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really , really cool on an original play-station 1 game , and early PC games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made . What puzzles me is where did the money go ? Pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la George Lucas circa 1975-83 , and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing ( or ruining in this case ) for about the same 20 million . This is quite possibly the worst film EVER made ! I would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of Ishtar than watch this film again . I hated it completely ! I regress . I say this IS the WORST film EVER made because unlike other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes , or Santa Claus Conquers the Martians , these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them , you love them . There is no love for this film and no place in my DVD library for it . I sold it to a guy for a dollar . I 'm betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew . Shame on you Pendragon films ! I want my money back !  
  please save your money and go see something else . this movie was such piece of crap . i didnt want to go , but i had to so i thought i 'd laugh at least once , NOPE . not a single laugh , it was that horrible ! chris kattan will never get a good comedy role after this and " a night at the roxbury . " this movie is completely obvious , has no smart humor at all , and just repeats itself over and over again . listen to me , and stray as far away from this movie as you possibly can !  
  Finally i thought someone is going to do justice to H.G. Wells 's classic , not another version set in the wrong locale or era , but one based firmly on the book . Well it definitely follows the book pretty closely , and that is the only plus to this mess . This is 180 Min 's ( yes 3 hours ) long , the book is only around 150 pages . If Timothy Hines had the nerve to come on here and say " if you can do any better .. " i would say " yes , i could " and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my life . I paid good money to get this crap over to the UK from the USA , do not make the same mistake as me .  
  Someone should tell Goldie Hawn that her career as a teen-age gamin ended thirty years ago . This is one of the worst films released in years , an unequivocal disaster in which the two leads give themselves over to a frenetic exposition of their trademark tics in an effort to make up for a bad script and bad directing . This thing should have been smothered at birth . I hope John Cleese got paid a lot for having his name attached to this disaster . He is the only performer who came through this stinking mess more or less unscathed , his only fault being a failure to realize that the rest of the cast would sink the picture .  
  Spike lee has to be one of the most over rated directors I have ever seen . He is the critic 's darling because he supposedly makes films with a " message " or he is just so bohemian in his approach that it makes critics that are waterlogged from formula Hollywood films eat his stuff up just for being different . Summer Of Sam does not even do that well . The cinematography and editing style is Oliver Stone , and so is the narrative . The plot is a lot like " Do The Right thing " . The portrayal of " Guidos " or for the PC set Italian-Americans ( of which I happen to be one ) is straight out of Eddie Murphy 's Raw . Only Eddie Murphy 's impression of a macho Italian guy picking a fight with a much taller African-American is much , MUCH more believable than the cartoonish , broad Italian caricatures shown here ( the John Leguizamo character being a possible exception ) . Is there anybody who saw this movie that could not figure out how it was going to end up ? As soon as Richie came into the film I could already see the fist in his face and the foot in his stomach , I could already see him being accused of being the killer . This character had the most integrity in the whole film so , of course , Lee is going to show what happens to people that stand out in a crowd ( what a white bearded clique ! ) Someone please , please give Spike Lee a lifetime pass to all the Basketball games he wants . So , maybe he will be enjoying himself too much to pick up a film camera for a long time and we won't have to be subjected to his self important drivel and furthermore I won't have to see critics ( some of them whom I respect ) ohh and ahh to an Emperor with no clothes .  
  A low budget effort from Texas that 's at least filmed well , but that is little consolation . Bad acting , or , should I say , bad over-acting , a pretty limp story line that 's nothing new , bad special effects , bad , bad , bad . Seems like a bunch of young folks are putting together a haunted house for Halloween , which is done every year , but this year things are different . Has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spots , of which there are a lot . Putrid , puerile , definitely avoidable , at all costs .  
  Once again I took a chance and rented this bag of crap . Billed as a horror flick , there wasn't one scene , not one , that was even remotely scarey . NOT ONE ! Sure there was some nudity , but all the lesbian action got a little old . I guess maybe that was suppose to be this movie 's saving grace ? And Dan , what an annoying ass bag ! Right from the beginning I knew I was in for it when good ol ' Dan first spoke . And he was suppose to be intimidating ? What a laugh ! All in all , this movie is dreadfully awful ! How in the hell do movies like this get made ? If you want a movie with a few thrills in it , don't rent this one . This movie is about as thrilling as the Teletubbies .  
  First this movie was not that bad . It was entertaining .. at least to me for probably all the wrong reasons . I have never seen the original so can't compare the two . This movie reminded me of that weird Christopher Reeve movie Village of the Damned . THe two movies have different plots , but that creepy disgusted feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both . The wicker man is suppose to be a mystery / thriller / men please don't anger the women movie . I don't know the whole pagan thing and sacrifice was a little off . Nicholas Cage , his glorious bad self goes to a secluded Island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long lost fiancée who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by fellow islanders . Cage is a police officer and being the weary policeman he is he goes to the semi uncharted island leaving no word of his whereabouts to anyone who is located in the real world . Stupid . Things get weirder when the large Amish-esquire women who populate the island snarl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl . His fiancée is no help who seems to be elusive and weary the whole time . Cage stays on the Island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man tricked to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the islands sick harvest festival . In this movie males do not fare so well . A sick twisted display of feminism ? I found the movie laughable at times particularly when cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit . I think there were too many potholes in this movie . I find the whole concept of angry women secluding themselves on an island without any care for males quite entertaining , but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird . While most women have had some jerk hurt and anger them this is clearly a form of sexism . I would have turned the movie off in disgust if the roles were reversed . This movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice . It is NOT a thriller it should be categorized as just strange .  
  This has got to be one of the worst fillums I 've ever seen and I 've seen a few . It is slow , boring , amateurish - not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot . The actors do not act . I can't blame them - they have been given a script of such utter banality all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in SummersIsle . There is not one moment in this film that rings true - not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved . The Nicholas Cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations . I have no doubt that I was seeing a suffering man up there but it was Nicholas Cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career .  
  How this film could miss so many of the fascinating , complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable . An unbelievably thin and unengaging plot , ankle-deep characterisation / motivation and a really awful soundtrack ( replacing tension with vast swathes of noise , replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars . Then there are the specific references to the original which are merely " plastered on " over the cracks .. Dreadful . In a world where gormless , brain-dead Amerikan remakes of The Italian Job ( a tear appears ) , Get Carter ( sobs uncontrollably ) and Alfie have desecrated our screens recently , this one takes the proverbial biscuit . Execrable nonsense . How Ellen Burstyn ever got involved is a wonder .. Rubbish .  
  This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that I 've spent in a very , very long time . If you knew how often I went to the movies you 'd probably say , that 's hard to imagine , but never-the-less , it 's true ! After seeing the trailer for this movie , I knew that I had to see it ! If you 're a fan of horror , mystery , and suspense , why wouldn't you ? The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting ; unfortunately , the movie is none of these . From the cinematography , to the script , to the acting , this movie is a complete flop . If you 're reading this , planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills , mystery , action , horror , or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes I 'm afraid you are in for disappointment . " Why is it so bad , " you might be asking yourself . Let me tell you . The movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful . Nothing about the movie made me the least bit " on edge , " frightened , or curious . The script was at best laughable . There were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous I began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn't . The acting was absolutely dreadful . I like Nicholas Cage but this was a miss . Without exception , every performance in this movie was incredibly below average . The cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique . Finally , the story is completely transparent . You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away . I am not usually a very harsh critic . Frankly , when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery / suspense / horror , I just want to be surprised . This movie was boring , poorly acted , poorly written , and an overwhelming disappointment . Do yourself a favor and go see something else .  
  Suggesting nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970s TV hit " Love , American Style , " decked out with flashes of nudity , " Superchick " ( 1973 ) is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain . And the lead character here , Tara B . True , really IS some kind of superchick . A stewardess ( not flight attendant ) who 's so good-looking that even her plane 's autopilot has made a pass at her ( ! ) , and with a hunky boyfriend in every port , this wingin ' , swingin ' gal really does put the " lay " in " layover . " What with her germaphobe surgeon beau in New York , her playboy with gangster problems in Miami , and her creatively challenged rock star dude in L.A. , Tara sure does keep busy . And when she 's not draining these guys of all their manly energies , as the viewer learns , she 's liable to be taking a karate class , mile-high clubbing , fending off flashers and rapists , attending groovy pot parties AND stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane . As I said , lighthearted fun , and surely good for a night when you 're feeling somewhat brain-dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube . Future astrologist Joyce Jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as Tara , and the film looks handsome enough to please . Disappointingly , buxom ' 70s faves Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin ( aka Candy Samples ) are wasted here in very small roles , but still get to do what they do best-show off their chesticles ! Though the picture is never laff-out-loud funny and doesn't really have many thoughts in its metaphorical head , it does succeed in being consistently amusing , and I suppose that is something . Strange that the end credits should call attention to Ms . Jillson 's body double , however ; don't think I 've ever seen THAT before !  
  High heels are tricksy things . They can elevate women ( or cross-dressing men ) to newfound heights , put forward a sharp statement of style and bring a touch of fragile elegance . Alternatively , they can be a perilous foot pain that will inevitably lead to trips , falls and ultimate tragedy . Tacones lejanos is more of a disappointment trip than a stylish high riser . Almodóvar 's mother-daughter drama is stylish for sure , but in terms of plot it 's a tongue-tied and tedious affair full of confusing , complex characters that never fully engage or make sense . A few moments of comedy aside , Tacones lejanos just isn't interesting . The best bit comes at the beginning in a marvellously macabre case of manslaughter orchestrated by a child . From this brilliant bit of black comedy things are looking up , but then the film comes to a heel . There 's solid enough acting performances and there 's some stylish , arty direction that you 'd expect from Almodóvar , but otherwise Tacones lejanos isn't an impressive piece of Spanish cinema . With a story of murder , showbiz , femininity , fractured mother-daughter relationship and a character who is alternately a judge , a transvestite and a police informer this could have been a melodramatic powerhouse . Instead it 's poor . High Heels stumbles for sure .  
  I 'll admit that I don't expect much from a Roger Corman film . Generally , I expect a lot of walking and bad scripts . Yet in this case , I am pleasantly surprised . The Gunslinger is a story of a woman ( played by the spunky Beverly Garland ) who takes over as sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered . Ms . Garland is a pretty good shot herself , killing one of the murderers the next day at her husband 's funeral . Her first task is to shut down the local bar that is violating the town curfew . The bar 's owner is trying to buy land in anticipation of being bought out by the ( hoped-for ) railroad . However , Ms . Garland is a thorn in her plans , and the bar matron hires a man to kill Ms . Garland . Because of Ms . Garland 's plays her role honestly and realistically , there is absolutely no temptation to go to Suzanne Somers " She 's the Sheriff " jokes . With the exception of a couple of faux pas ( the apartment door that opens OUT from the inside , jeep tracks , and the two horsemen waiting on screen for their cue to ride around a corner ) , the movie becomes quite passable as movie fare . However , Corman could not resist padding his film with horse riding scenes , much like he does walking in other films . Sterno says The Gunslinger is a horse opera worth your time .  
  Generally I don't like films directed by Sydney Pollack ( " The Firm " being somewhat of an exception ) and I 've never been a Robert Redford fan either . Still , I thought " Three Days of the Condor " must be good because of the number of praising comments it has received . Although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and Max von Sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer , I found the whole affair tremendously disappointing . The film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere , but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which doesn't seem to make any sense . The film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings I have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air . And what can one say about that absurd romance between Redford and Dunaway ? I 'd much rather watch any of Hitchcock 's films five times in succession than to sit through this piece of waste once more .  
  This is your only spoiler warning . What a sad state of our cinema when unprofessional junk like this is considered " Oscar worthy " . I divide material into three levels . The first is the stage theatre . Here the viewer is stagnant and the power rests in the presentation of the actor and , most importantly , in the power of the writer . A good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the ways of words better . The best playwrights know how to create imagery that the barren stage cannot show . The second level is film . In this medium , a weaker writer can be used , but the viewer is not sitting in one spot the entire time . With film , the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing . Furthermore , film can manipulate everday elements like sound and color in ways that are almost surreal . The final level is literature . In this context , everything is imagined by the author , translated onto paper , and then re-imagined by the reader . Far more detail can go into a novel than is conceivable for a film studio . This is why adaptations can go up , but never down . Novelizations are never better than the base film ( see the dime-per-dozen ones at your local book store ) , whereas the film cannot convey the same power as the original book ( Catch-22 and LotR ) . Movies can rarely be made into plays and plays can always be made into movies . As for ' The Last Picture Show ' , it fails . It is a film that should stick to the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right . The characters talk the same and act the same , it 's pure futility . Add to that an obnoxious soundtrack and you have an entirely unwatchable film . I saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe thespians . The instructor raved about how sad the movie was . What is sad is how such stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious . Had this been in color the scenes of impotence , the pool party , and the old hooker would be considered great comedy . Look what Lucas did with ' American Graffiti ' a few years later . The American secondary education system needs to start teaching ABOUT film rather than trying to teach WITH film . Two visually powerful downbeat films : Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon . Rely on them , not this . It 's the ' Last ' I want to see of it . 1 out of 5 .  
  This movie is not as good as all the movies of Christ I 've ever seen . And I 'm quite amazed that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus , when the Scriptures ( as well the other movies ) state differently . It lacks also a very important issue : The Resurrection .. None of the other movies skip this very important part : the faith of all of us Christians lies in this very event . As Paul says in one of his letters " If Christ did not rise from the dead , our faith is vain " . A very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem . Finally , and in opposition to my Jewish co-commentator , Jesus WAS NOT a myth . And as a matter of fact , he was also a JEW . There are plenty of documents ( relgious and secular ) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man ( or should I said , God become a man ) that indeed changed mankind . I strongly advise him ( given he is a historian ) to read about Flavius Josephus , the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st . Century .  
  The movie was " OK " . Not bad , not good , just OK . If there was anything else in the theater this would be skipped by far . Sadly , Fast and Furious 2 also stunk , but I 'd rather see this than FF2 . : ) If you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk , this will be a " cute " movie for you . Personally , I 'd wait for HBO or Blockbuster .  
  I saw this film opening weekend in Australia , anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger , Edgerton , Bloom , Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me . Unfortunately , despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role , the plot was paper thin .. which doesn't inspire me to read " Our Sunshine " . There were some other plus points , the support acting from Edgerton in particular , assured direction from Jordan ( confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well ) , and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush , much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it . But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero ( or was he ? ) .. in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US . Oh well , at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal .. Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey 's excellent " Secret History of the Kelly Gang " . 4/10  
  The majority of Stephen King 's short stories are little gems , with original ideas that don't take a long time to develop ; basically lean and mean-he sets them up quickly in a scarce number of pages , you read ' em , and you 're finished before you know you 've begun . They 're like the equivalent of a carton of McDonald 's fries-they taste Really good and you know there 's not much nutritional value in them ( re : from a literary standpoint , they don't say much about the universal human condition ) , but you 're still gonna scarf ' em down , just don't be a pig and go for the extra-super-sized portion and fill up on too much grease ( " too much grease " is a metaphor for the prose in King 's novels when find yourself reading one of them and saying come on-enough with the pop-cultural observations or clever Yankee asides-get on with the story already ! ) He has compiled four books of short story collections . I 've read them all-from NightShift to the latest , Everything 's Eventual , and they all display an efficiency of getting to the point which is sometimes sorely lacking in his tome-sized novels . But his short stories never overstay their welcome .. which brings us to the TV adaptations of Nightmares And Dreamscapes .. How in the hell did they ( the series ' producers ) get a green-light to turn stories that usually averaged 15 pages into 50 minute episodes ? I 'll tell you how-two words - " Stephen King . " Stories with his name on them probably didn't come cheap , and one hour shows enable more advertising than half hour ones , so .. what should have been an anthology of mostly 23 or 24 minute episodes is turned into double that length , and double the commercial time .. Ka-Ching ! I 'm not going to waste time synopsizing the plots of these stories-this review supposes you have already read the stories and / or seen the show ; what follows is merely my gut reactions to what TNT presented .. Of the four installments so far , here 's my ten cent assessment ( from first to worst ) : Battleground - Not a classic by any means , but hey , how could anyone argue with keeping William Hurt from opening his trap by filming this episode without a single line of dialog ? And the tongue-in-cheek reference and destruction of the killer Zuni doll from Trilogy Of Terror proved to me the producers ( and the writer of the teleplay , who is Richard Matheson 's son-the writer of TOT ) knew their mission with this one was to make the action deadly , yet at the same time , fun . It took longer to get to Hurt 's apartment than it should have , but I think it fulfilled it 's objective . 8/10 Umney 's Last Case - Liked this one primarily because of William H . Macy 's performance . I think the writer / Umney should have appeared in the story sooner into the private eye / Umney beginning because he was the actual reality of the story , and anyone familiar with the King short story ( probably half , if not more of the audience ) knew the Chandleresque set-up was due to get interrupted by the writer 's reality , so let 's get on with it already , and cut-out the cute and clever hard-boiled repartee ' Private Dick banter already . Once the writer / Umney 's family tragedy began to reveal though , I thought the show developed an emotional connection that made the viewer ( me , at least ) , feel sympathy for the real-life Macy 's attempt to escape his sorrows by usurping his fictional creation 's exciting life . 6/10 The End Of The Whole Mess - Uh , this title is how I felt about this episode when it was over . After twenty minutes , I was ready to scream at the TV-OK , we get it already , the younger brother is a Mega Mensa Genius Prodigy Extraordinaire ! We know from Ron Livingston talking to the camera ( " time is running out for me " - not fast enough , I thought ) that the young whiz kid is going to discover something really bad for humanity-we know this because he 's already built an airplane but almost died because he couldn't steer it out of the path of a tree ; and , he blew up his chemistry lab while teaching himself chemistry ( to think the end of the world could have been prevented if only this kid had some more parental supervision ) . So much time was wasted on establishing the uber-genius of Henry Thomas , when we finally get to the resolution of his discovery-the end of the world through unintended idiocy-how much do we get to see of the world " ending ? " -a cheap video shot of a reporter starting to forget what she 's reporting on , and brief radio broadcasts announcing the day of judgement is at hand . Oh , and the brother 's parents drooling and singing old songs . My point is , if your story is really about the " end of the whole mess ( world ) " , I wanna see the " mess " as it goes up in flames and crashes and burns . Talk about ending with a whimper , indeed . 2/10 Crouch End - This episode just ticked me off totally . I could have lived with the taking-forever exposition of the happy couple arriving at their hotel , playing slap-and-tickle , having lunch , and getting a taxi ( that was half the episode right there ) , if once they finally crossed-over into Crouch End the episode delivered the chills , but it failed miserabley . Not only wasn't it scary , it was practically laughable . Ooh , look-a kitty .. wait , it turns .. oh my god ! Look at it 's scary eye ! Uh-huh . They could have gone a long way towards filming the Crouch End sequence at night instead of in daylight , too . Things you might unintentionally find funny can become scarier when you see them in the night shadows . But I guess the budget wasn't high enough to shoot at night on the fake London sets they slapped together for this one . On the page , this is a very scary story about tourists wandering into places they shouldn't and the terrible things that might lurk just around a corner there . The only terror in this adaptation was the directing and acting-those were truly horrifying . 1/10 Overall Series Average ( so far ) : 4/10  
  Caught this by accident on a t . v . showing - and could hardly believe how utterly awful the whole experience was . By comparison , the original " A Man Called Horse " was spell-binding because it held one 's interest throughout . But this piece of nonsense - words fail me . It was bad enough to have some kind of a " story " presented with all the impact of a wet loaf of bread , but that error was compounded by the obvious lack of subtitles throughout whenever the so-called " Sioux " spoke . For goodness sake , couldn't the film-makers have found enough North American Indians who were also actors and near-actors to perform as " Indians " in this farrago instead of the imposters they actually used ? I also found it quite embarrassing watching Richard Harris cavorting all around the countryside at the obvious behest of the director standing just behind camera , telling him to run and jump from pointless Point A to pointless Point B just to make up film footage and minutes . Absolutely terrible in all respects !  
  This ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of " Hamlet " to ever reach the screen . Branagh 's approach to the material can only be described as vulgar ; going to such lengths as depicting Ophelia in a straight jacket , having Fortinbras ' army appear suddenly on the horizon ( looking very much like the climax of " Monty Python and the Holy Grail " ) when the palace is apparently guarded only by Francisco ( who shouts the very un-Shakespearean cry of " ataack " before being gunned down ) , and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of Jimmy Cagney 's Bottom and Mary Pickford 's Kate . Branagh chose to set his film in an Edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text , so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in Elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed . And Branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of Hamlet and Olphelia 's relationship , treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window . The uncut text does allow Branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime : more footage of Kenneth Branagh . This is never so apparent as in the " How All Occasions Inform Against Me " speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film ( at least that 's how it feels ) , which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of Gone With The Wind 's " I 'll never be hungry again . " This may serve Branagh 's ego , but it does not serve Shakespeare or the speech : when I saw the film in the theater , I leaned over to my companion and snickered " Great Moments With Mr . Hamlet . " Branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last , when he attempts to out-do the Olivier film and its justly celebrated death of Claudius by having Hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch , impaling him with a sword . Branagh 's Dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through Claudius ' heart with a super hero 's bulls eye . The only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off-the-wall funny . While this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy , it is in fact nothing but a star-studded display of a once-talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism . The Emperor has no clothes , and this Hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man 's ego out of control .  
  The makers of this film have created a future where not only is abortion and birth control illegal in every state , but women are prosecuted for murder and sent away to serve long prison sentences . In other words , this film is every liberals worst nightmare ! The political agenda is so heavy-handed here and the style of the film is so low-key that it just loses steam pretty quickly . Regardless of which side of the fence you 're on , I 'd recommend skipping it .  
  This film was slated to be a blockbuster film , and it really is . This is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics . With that in mind , the movie delivers , perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy Iron Man , but well enough . Outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects , the film drops off of the cliff faster than Wile E . Coyote . Many viewers , myself included , will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered , but that only makes the film a poor adaptation , not a poor film . This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons . The makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind . The characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to 4-scene cameos . The main characters of Wolverine , Victor Creed ( never called Sabertooth in the film ) and Colonel Stryker are well developed . I was pleasantly surprised by Liev Schriber 's performance . The rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eye-candy . Wolverine 's character is fully developed after 30-minutes , as is Sabertooth , though Victor does pull off some surprises late in the film . The " final boss " of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is . The filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular character . Very disappointing ..  
  OK this movie was really " unique " shall we say . Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented in the movie , even though it is said she had a coke problem during the movie . but she said that she can't remember to much of it . well thats her excuse but whats everyone else 's ? i can't imagine they all had a coke problem . whatever it wasn't all that bad i mean i guess the plot was OK and it had some pretty funny moments . although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste . oh well i guess i was disappointed cause Carrie fisher is like so awesome and this movie did nothing for her .  
  Too many secondary plot lines without a primary one . Too many hot buttons are pushed without any reason , they managed to stuff this boring film , that does not say anything , with every drama element that is out there : death , divorce , money issues , parenting problems , suicide , psychological problems , drug abuse , adoption , rejected love , traveling problems , sex , generations misunderstandings , robbery , legal issues , guns , medical ethics , " deep real love "  You would think that it would make for an interesting movie , but hell no  all these events are secondary to something primary which is not there . Boring . Not to mention that the " super-deep " ( and super-long ) lecture to the child at the end of the film is a total nonsense . Pity . Oh , forgot to mention : the actors , all of them , are quite good . That 's what kept me from turning it off . To bad their talents went to waste , The film is well shot , too : the light , the motion etc . of every episode - that 's all in place . It 's just the meaning that 's missing .  
  Don't be deceived as I was by the ' glowing ' reviews quoted on the DVD box . " Wildly entertaining . " , " a seriously scary freakout . " , and the worst of all , " ON PAR WITH JAWS . " This movie is none of the above . Normally I don't bother with writing bad reviews for films but I can't believe this one is resting at a comfortable 7 on IMDb . It doesn't deserve it . After a so-so opening daylight attack by a monster created by , what else , chemicals dumped by lazy scientists , this movie goes absolutely nowhere and it goes there sloowly . Basically and improbably , a girl is snagged by the monster ( I 'll give them points for a good creature design but this ain't no WETA creation ) and her semi-comical family spend an hour and a half tracking her down .. in the sewers surrounding the Han river . Their search lacks any suspense-again , someone called this on par with Jaws ? - and by the time they find her you realize it was all pretty much pointless . Other than that , a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in one funny scene involving a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop . Blech . This was bad . I 'm not kidding . You want to see a rotten monster movie ? Rent Deep Rising . At least you 'll save 30 minutes of your life .  
  had some lovely poetic bits but is really just an artsy-fartsy toss-together with no direction or resolution . how do these people get through film school ? who gives them money to make this crap ? could have been so much more , fine lead actor , and i always like Fairuza Balk , but come on , the alt-rock metaphor of just staring vacantly unable to find anything compelling is just so tired , and it sure doesn't make for good films . the director needs to go away and live life for a good long while and not come back to the camera until they really have something to say . this is like the throw spaghetti at the wall school of art-making , just juxtapose a bunch of earnest imagery and hope hope hope like hell that poetry emerges . that can work , if the director actually has any kind of vision , or has a brain that knows when it 's in the presence of potential , but here it 's just space filler , of no consequence . i felt the lazy ending coming moments before it hit , and was yelling " you lazy bastard " at the screen when the credits popped up .  
  Oh dear , what a horrid movie . The production was so cheap and nasty .. Remember the shot from " the Natural " , where the lightning hits the tree ( leaving a glowing stump ) that Roy Hobbs makes a bat from ? Well the producers of this movie used that same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch slammed into the house . I wonder if they paid to use the footage from The Natural , or did they just hope that no-one who would watch the film would pick it up ? Then at the end where they were getting trying to get away in the truck . Such over-acting in the cabin . A really bad film , a really bad film .  
  The point of Wolfe 's original novel - indeed the point of the whole story - is that things take place because of a carefully calculated sense of expediency . The goal is survival within a particular kind of life style . The novel is full of malice . The only relationship that rings emotionally true is that between Sherman and his daughter , Campbell , and that 's only touched upon . That aside , everyone is out for what he can get in the way of publicity , power , money or self aggrandizement . Wolfe was criticized for hitting every character and every social segment of New York City over the head . His response was a denial . After all , he lived in New York himself and belonged to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations , exactly the qualifications one would want on his resume in order to deny that he disliked New Yorkers . ( Wolfe has a PhD in American Studies from Yale and is no dummy . ) Those supposed weaknesses are what made the novel memorable . Nobody was any good . And Sherman McCoy wound up broke , a professional protester for social justice . The movie throws all of that away and imposes a moral frame on the story that simply doesn't fit . Wolfe did his homework . The novel was rooted in reality . Every event was not only possible but thoroughly believable . Wolfe might have made a great cultural anthropologist - he knows how to get inside a system and record its details . Yes , any of us might have found ourselves , as Sherman and his mistress do , stuck in the South Bronx , threatened by a couple of black kids , and making a getaway after bumping into one of them . That scene is transferred neatly from print to celluloid . But after that scene the movie seems not to trust its audience and at times become frantic in its attempt to spell out its message , however nebulous the message is . Sherman might accidentally hit some kid and be arrested for it as he is in the novel , but he would not immediately upon his release from jail go back to his phenomenally expensive condo , take out a shotgun , and start shooting into the ceiling with it , as he does in the movee . In what 's supposed to be a funny scene , ceiling plaster falls all over the party guests and they scurry away , shrieking . It simply would not have happened . The movie has left the novel 's unspeakably detailed reality in the dust . Wolfe 's sensibility , the work he put into capturing the real , has been lost . What we get instead is a noisy , fantastic , and silly scene that doesn't do anything except wake the audience up . Similar empty scenes follow , screaming out for Wolfe 's verisimilitude . The movie also fails because it thrusts a lot of sin and redemption into an entertaining story of moral nihilism . Here we see " Don Juan in Hell " at the opera . We get lectures on redemption from a poet with AIDs . We see a lot of guilt in Sherman . A black judge who preaches from the bench and gives one of those final speeches about how we all have to start behaving nicely again . A reporter who feels sorry for Sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb . And a happy ending in which Sherman gets off by breaking the law with an idiotic grin . The scene sits on the movie like a jester 's cap on a circus elephant 's head . The movie not only makes points that are already trite and unoriginal , it overstates them , as if the audience were incapable of absorbing any subtleties . It 's not the acting or the direction that 's poor . The film 's not bad in those respects . And the photography is pretty good too , including two rather spectacular shots - the gargoyles of the Chrysler building and the landing of the Concorde . It 's the script that is thoroughly botched . The first half of the movie , roughly , is okay in conception and execution . It keeps some of the little details from the novel . Sherman and Judy 's dog is named Marshall . Who the hell would name a dog Marshall ? It loses its focus almost completely in the second half and on the whole is barely worth watching . Wolfe 's cynical redneck right-wingism may be offensive to a lot of people , but he 's got the cojones to lay his percepts out . Alas the writers and producers did not have the courage to pick them up and thus blew the chance to make a fascinating study of New Yorkers .  
  This was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there . But the casting decisions completely wrecked the movie . Hanks is a great actor to be sure , but lacks the smarmy , morally ambivalent characteristics needed for the lead role . Jeff Daniels would have been my choice . Putting Melanie Griffiths in , for eye candy reasons , is understandable , but again , she did not portray the depth or ambivalence , so need to pull this off . This movie is a great example of how every decision , even those early on in the movie production can make or break a file .  
  This film is quite boring . There are snippets of naked flesh tossed around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake but they don't succeed . The best thing about the movie is Lena Olin-she does a masterful job handling her character , but Day-Lewis garbles most of his lines . Kaufman clearly had no idea how to film this . The incongruities in bouncing between domestic household / marriage issues and political crises are badly matched . Character attitudes change without explanation throughout . Badly disjointed .  
  The Biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say Zues takes DUTCH commands . But she is speaking German to him . The 2 languishes are completely different , its like saying " well he takes French commands " and start talking Spanish . James Belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest . The role just doesn't fit him , even if its mend to be a comedy . To many stereotype / predicable stuff . Typical comment or comebacks . If you don't look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on TV . But i wouldn't suggesting renting it .  
  After being bitten by a bat in a cave , a doctor named John Beck undergoes an accelerating transformation into a man-bat creature . His wife assures him that there 's nothing wrong with him , it 's all just due to rabies or the anti-rabies drugs he 's taking . The local cop thinks that John is responsible for several gruesome murders . " The Bat People " by Jerry Jameson is one hell of a horrible film . The script is deadly dull and there is no gore nor nudity . This pointless piece of crap is so mind-numbingly boring that you 'll scratch your head in a total disbelief after suffering through it . Even the design of a man-bat creature by a young Stan Winston is completely pathetic and unmemorable . Avoid this stinker like the plague . 2 out of 10 .  
  Ludicrous violations of the most basic security regs are only the beginning . It 's hard to see how they achieved such abysmal trash on such a low budget . I turned it off once , then got curious to see if it could get any worse . It did .  
  Oh my . I decided to go out to the cinemas with some friends , wanting to watch one of those mild , feel-good Christmas movies , and I walk out disgusted . The movie failed . Full-stop . Paul Giamatti who I consider as a good actor played his character and roll just horribly , along with Vince Vaughn who has always been a personal favourite of mine . They try and turn a Christmas movie , into some new-style . Sort of bad , mixed with good , but it all turned out very wrong . The first ten or so minutes weren't too bad , but once we saw Santa , it was over . It didn't get any better , the rate stayed the same , there was NO character development , and certainly is one of the worst Christmas movies ever invented . Don't watch it , whatever you do .  
  Lifetime did it again . Can we say stupid ? I couldn't wait for it to end . The plot was senseless . The acting was terrible ! Especially by the teenagers . The story has been played a thousand times ! Are we just desperate to give actors a job ? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller . Once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie , this isn't one of them . Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost . This was a waste of two hours of my life . Can I get them back ? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide . That would have been more entertaining .  
  I think this movie was supposed to be shocking . But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it 's been made .. and simply is . It 's one and a half hour of torment . Even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie ( the five girls ) . Sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way , which is basically fine , since it 's a horror-movie . And I ( usually ) like horror-movies . I 've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se . However all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever . It 's no spectacle other than that it 's simply grotesque . It 's so lame it even gets boring , and really quick too . The worst thing ( if the above wasn't bad enough for ya ) about this movie is that they 've tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project , by filming with cheap hand-held-cameras . But ( again , this too ) serves no end whatsoever . In the " Blair Which " , sure enough , there 's an explanation , namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch . In this film , there 's no other explanation than : " Hey ya 'll we wanted this to LOOK LIKE the Blair Whitch ! " The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about . The girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can't make out what they 're saying . Also , no effort has been made to make anything any better , sound-wise or other wise . Than finally , there 's the soundtrack , which is just as bad as the rest , and varies from cheap euro-house to the worst grungy hard-rock .. My advise : Don't watch this under ANY circumstances .  
  Hiya folks , Well , this movie sucks really . Think " Love Actually " in reverse . Nothing fits quite right , nothing is coherent , and certainly nothing makes you laugh . Love is rare in this film . It IS a total flop . As indicated however , there are three redeeming points about this mangled potential of a film . A ) With a star billing of Jennifer Love Hewitt , there will be hordes of guys who will submit with grace to viewing this just to catch a glimpse of the petite Hewitt with form fitting clothing . To tell you now guys .. there are some promising scenes .. but it 's really weak eye candy . The " possibilities " here are watered down . Nevertheless , I watched the whole thing tempted by the next scene of you know what .. titillating ! B ) The ending is romantic and positive . That it 's contrary and " over the top " is relevant .. yet for me was still a positive point . C ) Dougray Scott plays an amourous friendly guy .. REFRESHING ! THANK YOU ! 2/5 , not worthy of your 10 or so dollars . 2/3 's of the way through , I was convinced Jennifer Love Hewitt was becoming the next softcore legend . Although I 'll take that back for now .. it hinges greatly on her next film . Oh , and her sister is way stupid . Her husband is way stupid .. and what the heck , she 's way stupid . Next time . can't wait for the next Love Actually with JLH !  
  At least it 's not full of sensless violence or fluff . It 's also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline . This story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green . The story is disjointed and goes off in strange directions , to no conclusion . I also don't believe the director spent much time around a golf country club , either . Some of the depictions are absurd . Not very engaging .

" From Dragon Dynasty comes the Hong Kong gangster drama , " Dragon Heat . " For reasons which will probably forever be completely obscured , the production and casting call for this ' criminals-on-steroids ' movie somehow got both Maggie Q and Michael Biehn to sign on as villains . But they don't get all that much to do in this horrid slug-fest . They are two of the best contemporary actors around , each with their own resume ' and list of accomplishments , and Biehn in particular has had the courage to take some rather challenging and non-heroic roles . Maggie Q was the super-bad " Mai " in " Live Free Or Die Hard , " so ' nuff said . Biehn is , of course , famous for being the soldier from the future who made " The Terminator " of 1984 such a believable science-fiction / fantasy romp , by crashing up against Big Arnold , who is now the Governator of California ! Michael Biehn is almost wholly wasted in this terrible train-wreck of a police drama . There is absolutely no reason for that , as the incredibly convoluted plot - given mostly in Chinese , as it is a Hong Kong story - could have been better elaborated for non-Chinese audiences with a foreign narrator . In other words , if Biehn had been used as something like an Interpol observer or coordinator , or an agent under deep cover , who needs to get some ' splaining given to him every five or ten minutes , that would have been great . But no , he 's brought in as a part of an odd group of special forces-type bad guys who seem to be freelancing their own corrupt deal , in the middle of somebody else 's totally corrupt deal involving the local king of corrupt deals . Yes , there , I said it all . Confused ? Me too . " Welcome to the party , pal . " In the truly superb Hong Kong crime drama , known by its English title as " Breaking News , " there are also a number of fascinating characters at work , but there is only one story line in the plot . Bad guys vs . good cops . In this wretched and excessively violent foray into the world of a Hong Kong Triad , or gang , it seems that the hot-shot police force is little more than a parade of ducks in a shooting gallery , the way the criminals mow them down . So , not surprisingly , there 's an almost otherwise incomprehensible scene ( several scenes , in fact ) , where kids are trying to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game , to win stuffed animal prizes . And so the hot shot good-guy police officers quite naturally intervene on their behalf , so that the arcade owner has to give up the Kewpie dolls . There 's also a half-hearted attempt at creating a " love interest " between one of the ' visiting cops ' and the sole female ' visiting cop ' . The visiting cops are supposed to be material witnesses against the Triad gangster leader , who gets hijacked on the way to his court appearance , but not by his own team but by the mercenaries ( Biehn , Maggie Q , and some others ) . These killers all want something but we don't get to learn about what it is , until the very end of the film ! That was a stupid mistake inside of the overall story . You cannot build suspense in a crime drama without something to obtain , or get , or get away from , being introduced very early in the story . Add to that some " cut-away scenes " done for purely artsy effects , all showing the bad-bad guys ' and the regular bad guys ' recent pasts , and any film buff can readily understand why this barking dog gets a 1 rating from this fan of all things cinematic with criminals and conspirators and Hong Kong .  
  By now you should already know about this film , the Jessica Simpson " bomb " that pretty much went straight to video ( limited , anemic theatrical run ) . Basically , Ms . Simpson 's Katie travels from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend , to surprise him , only to find him in bed with another woman . She is stranded , but has one friend ( Rachel Leigh Cook , whom I wish we saw more often in film ) , who lets her stay . Katie ends up getting a job via two conniving co-workers ( Penelope Ann Miller and the always amusing Andy Dick ) who are just using Katie to get the president of the firm ( Larry Miller ) ousted . This is strictly a b movie , its not meant to be profound . Jessica Simpson is not a great actress by any means , but she is pretty much beautiful and never truly annoying . The film is watchable in that its not an abomination , but its throwaway fluff . In a cameo , Penny Marshall is funny ( a subtle in-joke about Milwaukee made me chuckle ) , and there is a funny scene involving Norwegian priests ( don't read too much into this ) . So , not horrible , but easy to skip . Your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does . Again , not good , but not a profound disaster .  
  - = contains spoiler from both original and movie versions = - i am a huge fan of Notre dame De Paris musical , i also read book this summer and i watched movie today , in the beginning i was hopeful to watch a good film especially when i saw 6.3 IMDb point . first scenes were good but i actually waited for , theaters scene directly from book , but it was normal but when Esmeralda kisses gringoire i felt something is wrong .. they don't even kiss in book , even in musical .. and there were huge gap why Esmeralda being judged by sorcerer , in the book she teaches her goat how to respond numbers of clock or write word " phoebus " .. wait there were a phoebus weren't there ? in this movie he is some soldier junk nothing more , the creators made Quasimodo 's love to show around and they even canceled Frollo 's love .. but Notre dame was frollo . his thoughts his struggles between love of god and love of human in movie we cant find anything like that all we have is , some villain who is really bad and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts .. and not mentioning phoebus , not mentioning love of frollo , not mentioning jehan ( brother of frollo ) not mentioning mother of Esmeralda ( maybe it is OK , the storyline would have chopped much ) they even not mentioned the real story .. ( another PS : frollo wasn't a opus dei or some cult member he actually in interest with alchemy he tries to make gold .. he was stuck in science and religion ) finally don't watch this movie , it is some kind of directors edition to real masterpiece , and if you have watched it before read the book , god have mercy on you .. you must read to book immediately .. this movie is worse than hunchback of Notre dame II the animated movie , spend your time with watching Notre dame De Paris musical .. enough said ..  
  There may something poetically right in seeing dentists suffer . Suffer they do , in this dreary , truly dreadful film , but they cause the audience to undergo pain of the non-dental variety too . If you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids , barfing kids , sick kids , lots of long , long meaningful glances , a deadpan wife and a concerned husband : it 's all here for you . Boring , overlong , it stands out as one of those examples that scream out : why ? Is there a saving grace ? Yes , there is . There is a short scene from Nabucco , with some pretty good singing . Save your money , or if it 's on TV or cable , save your time . You can always read a book or make an omelette .  
  A Christmas Story Is A Holiday Classic And My Favorite Movie . So Naturally , I Was Elated When This Movie Came Out In 1994 . I Saw It Opening Day and Was Prepared To Enjoy Myself . I Came Away Revolted And Digusted . The Anticipation that Rang True In A Christmas Story Is Curiously Missing from This mess . A Red Ryder BB Gun Is Better to get than a chinese top . And It Is Not Very Funny At all . Charles Grodin Is Good but the Buck Stops There . Bottom Line : 1 Star . Don't Even Bother .  
  This movie is very important because suggested me this consideration : sometimes you can wish to be sick .. sometimes you can wish to have a syndrome .. sometimes , for example , you can wish have Goldfield Syndrome .. that way you 'd not remember this boring movie .. and above all you 'd not remember Adam " superfluos " Sandler .. sometimes , simply , you can wish .. have rented another movie .. My vote ? 3 out of 10 . My suggestion ? If you are neither a fan of boring romantic comedies or Adam Sandler ( .. it 's a joke don't exist Adam Sandler 's fan .. I want to hope it ) , save yourself .. Someone to save ? Drew Barrymore . .. perhaps .  
  Since this picture is classified a " pure entertainment " work and since there are already many comments on it , I 'd like hereby to address something relevant to the abuse of humour . We can see that Marlon Wayans is playing the joker role in this film . Certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job , he has always been acting as a little man-an actor can change his customary dress but can hardly change his physical appearance-and the latter one can be an advantage when necessary . However far away from what I expected , I saw an image very disguising , pretending to expose different aspects of the baby life by mistake of a forty-year - old criminal . And with a ridiculous happy ending . So what is the point ? Many elements are mixed up , some principal ones are violence , sex and criminal activities , amongst which the story is badly composed and to some extent , lack common sense : where is Vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and her husband 's life being pursued ? In addition the diamond is even bigger than the world 's No . 1 Cullinan ! But the most sickening facet is the continuous attempt to make up the little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points . And they call it humour . A diamond is precious , hard and fragile ; it cannot be cut by any other material but only be conquered by the hot blood of a male goat . Hence it 's no more a diamond but pieces of debris .  
  Wow , this is very unusual in one regard : usually the first movie in a long string of sequels is the best of the bunch . People are surprised when a sequel is actually better . With Tarzan , I thought this movie was the worst of the bunch , or at least the first six which comprise my Tarzan Collection DVD package . I will gladly watch the sequels multiple times but I am through sitting through this turkey , thanks to several characters . Well , let 's start with the good news first : THE GOOD - Plenty of action with a lot of wild animals on display , even if they are just stock footage . You see lion attacks , crocodiles , hippos , panthers , you name it , and you see several of the different tribes of all kinds , including pygmies ( called " dwarfs " in the movie . ) Since this movie was made almost 75 years ago , I can't knock any of the realism because they didn't have it in the movies that long ago . They do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds . However , Weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape . He and O'Sullivan make a well-built handsome couple , if there ever was one in those Golden Years of cinema . The film has historical value ( with so many sequels ) in that it shows how Tarzan acquired Jane and his beginnings of learning the English language . The BAD - From the moment " Jane Parker " is taken by Tarzan almost every scene with her is Maureen O'Sullivan in hysterics , shrieking and screaming scene after scene . It 's enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film . Thankfully , she calmed down in the sequels , but not in this movie . The movie also does no favors for " The Great White Hunter " image as C . Aubrey Smith , playing Jane 's father , and Neil Hamilton , as " Harry Holt , " the safari guide , shoot at every animal within sight , whether the beasts is threatening or not . These people are kill - happy , particularly Smith . On another note , it 's too bad there isn't anything in here explaining how Tarzan got to be in the jungle in the first place . There is no history of him in here or footage of his growing up . He 's just there when Jane and the group get to a certain point in Africa .  
  This movie displayed more racial hatred of Jews by David Mamet than I have have ever encountered in an American film . The sterotypes are so over the top that my ability to continue watching died . I was so disappointed at Joe Mantegna calling a bunch of men , sitting in a New York Jewish center cleaning weapons , heros that common sense prevailed and I stopped . I am deeply disturbed at the concept that Jews are not Americans and " different " . I suggest that Mr . Mamet is one of the causes of hatred not a healer of same .  
  Slither is a horror comedy that doesn't really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other . It has one scene that is exceptionally good , any number of zingers that work , but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie . In addition , the script does not focus on the hero and heroine , and goes off kilter in several places . A major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero ( Fillion ) to follow Grant Grant ( Michael Rooker ) as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster . This whole part of the film drags - Michael Rooker 's character isn't that interesting to us as a person , and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monster 's interest might be interesting if this was Grant - Portrait of a Man Turning Into A Monster rather than a horror-comedy alien invasion movie . In the final analysis this movie 's problems are in the script - it isn't that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates . The purpose of a horror-comedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them , with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens . Instead we get an exploration of the alien 's habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag . The ostensible heroine ( Elizabeth Banks as Starla Grant ) is more central to this part , but nonetheless I felt the movie had left its narrative track , unless it planned on following Grant Grant all the way to the end . When Fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook , but once again the problem is in the script . By this point that audience knows - and the characters should know - that Grant is not just suffering from some disease , and act accordingly ( shotguns ) - instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that " let us get you to a hospital " is going to help . Although their reactions might have been human and real , these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised - delivered action . A lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing . * SPOILERS AHEAD * After the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack ( a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie ) the script once again betrays the movie . At this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien . The writer-director ( Gunn ) chooses as this character a completely new character , rather than one of already developed minor characters . Why ? Why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot ? By the time this character is attacked , we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her , even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath . Had Gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters , he could have completely avoided introducing her family , and saved time and money . Furthermore , the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the alien 's plans without all the additional characters , and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigor . My last criticism is based on the movie 's look . Gunn is primarily a writer , or maybe it was budgetary constraints , but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting . Most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field , and the screen simply looks drab . The sets in Wheelsy ( the fictional town where the action takes place ) look cheap . The whole movie looks cheap . Box Office Mojo states the films ' budget was $ 15 million , newspapers say $ 29 million , and considering they didn't use any name talent , I would say the money did not show up on screen . The monster is just repulsive , and rarely looks deadly . The last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the character 's actions . By the time Fillion and Co have begun hunting Grant / the alien , one woman has disappeared and Grant is known to have been mutilating animals . At this point I was expecting the FBI or at least the State Police to show up and take over from the hick Sheriff . A woman has disappeared and likely been murdered , and a local has been acting psychotic . Time to call the authorities . But basically I was hoping that would happen because I just wanted some characters who would show up and ACT . Although this movie is ostensibly a horror-comedy , the movie it bears the most resemblance to is Dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions . Whereas Dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story ( especially the entire Morgan Freeman subplot ) and particularly the ending , in many ways it was stronger , primarily because the main characters were stronger , but more importantly because it looked beautiful . Although that may be anathema - preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values - that just shows you how uninteresting I found the look of Slither .  
  I watch lots of scary movies ( or at least they try to be ) and this has to be the worst if not 2nd worst movie I have ever had to make myself try to sit through . I never knew the depths of Masacism until I rented this piece of moldy cheese covered in a used latex contraceptive . I am a fan of Julian Sans , but this is worse than I would hope for him . On the other hand the story was promising and I was intrigued .. for the first minute and a half while the credits rolled and I had yet to see what pain looked like first hand . Perhaps there are some viewers out there that enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction , but then again I know of those viewers who understand if not commemorate me , especially when we had to turn the video off , and that simply is NOT done with our watching ( we had to make one exception obviously ) . If it were up for a remake , I 'd give it a chance so long as they had at most 1 % of the original incorporated into it . That 's all .  
  This movie bewilders me . It may be that I 'm just a stupid American , but I really just don't get 400 Blows . Everything I 've read about this movie has been a total rave , but I just couldn't stay interested . I 'm sure that it was as revolutionary in film-making as all the critics say , but when it boils right down to it , it 's just really really boring . Maybe it 's the language barrier , may I 'm just not " sensitive " or " artsy " enough , but whatever the case is , I hated this movie . The story itself isn't bad ; it 's about a young French boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers , and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility . That in itself ought to be interesting , and it was , at first . There was nothing wrong with the dialogue , but then again it 's hard to say because half of the conversations weren't subtitled and for no apparent reason , so I didn't always know what was going on . But for the dialogue we could understand , it made enough sense . The actors were believable enough , but it 's hard to say what a real person would do in these situations . So you feel for the main character , but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think , well that sucks . The plot isn't even your typical plot . Each time he gets in trouble , he gets into more trouble than the last time , but the reasons never vary too much . And through the entire film you realize that there 's nothing the main character can really do about it . So it 's more like just waiting to see how it ends . The ending , by the way , was completely over my head . It 's way too artsy for me , and I just didn't get it . Leading up to the end was easy enough to follow . The structure was certainly there , and it made sense as well , but everything was really drawn out . For the amount of dialogue and significant moments , the movie could have been an hour shorter . It just didn't end . Part of it was the unnecessarily long shots , none of which were especially memorable ; for example , the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds . Now , I 'm sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere , but for the average viewer , I 'd rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time . Or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running , like doing my laundry , or taking a nap . Final Verdict The feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson , if I could only get what the director was trying to say by his unique decisions . As it was , I just felt cheated out of a good two hours of my life .  
  with all the European studios involved in this one , you would think you 'd at least get some pretty photography ; but the local color is kept to a minimum . Irritation # 1 is Mira Sorvino using a Russian accent in order to play a Spanish cop - WTF ? The story is hopelessly confused . There 's a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused - is she or isn't she a lesbian ? - serving no purpose whatsoever . The cops in the movie are the most stupid to have graced a serial killer film in a long time . There seems to be some message about the mid-'30s Spanish Civil War But since pretty much everybody involved in that is dead , one doesn't see the point in it . Despite the bull-fighting backdrop of part of the narrative ( which part ? who can tell ) , you never even get a good look at a bull fight . Earnest Hemingway would have punched the director in the nose - with my blessings .  
  I loved " The Curse of Frankenstein " so much that I rushed out to get " Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed " to see Cushing at it again .. even if it was without Chistopher Lee this time . To my great disappointment , this movie not only does without Lee , but it does without Frankenstein 's Monster altogether ! Was it a case of " If we can't get Lee , we won't have a monster at all " ? Why would they do that ? The monster is half the fun of the whole thing ! This film is dedicated solely to the study of Baron Frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum . I found the script extremely weak , with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much . I 'm willing to suspend a fair amount , but this movie got fairly ridiculous , which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in it . Peter Cushing , though , is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film . For being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men , he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well . The supporting cast is competent , but has little to do , even the young doctor and his fiancée blackmailed into helping Frankenstein . A bumbling police chief is introduced , along with his put-upon sidekick , to generate some comic relief , then they are completely dropped from the movie ! Why ? We are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the Baron , then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor , and then it ends up being the victim of Frankenstein 's brain transplant experiment . There was no tension , we weren't invested in the " creature " , and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one unsatisfied because it is so clear they are setting up another sequel . Also , there are virtually no " horror " elements . Yes , there is a beheading in the beginning ( off-camera ) , and we are treated to the sounds of Cushing cutting the tops of two men 's skulls off ( again , off camera ) , and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene ( 90 % of which is , again , off-camera ) . I understand that there is a love of " letting the audience imagine it all , for their imaginations are far worse than what we can show " , but come on , if you 're not going to give us a Monster , then at least let us SEE the few " horrific " elements you do choose to include . Showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary . On top of a weak script , I thought the directing was mostly flat . There were a couple of nice shots , but otherwise no excitement , atmosphere , or suspense was generated . The same director did " Curse " back in 1958 and I thought it was brilliantly directed .. guess he was as uninspired by this film as I was . The movie gets a 4 out of 10 from me strictly for Peter Cushing 's powerful , nuanced performance .. beyond that , I found little in this movie worth recommending . Instead , my suggestion is to watch " The Curse of Frankenstein " and see a truly great Hammer horror film .  
  Like all the Taviani Brothers films , this one looks great , but it is rotten to the core with false romanticism , and coincidences heap upon each other in some facsimile of a " story " . In actuality , this is really just a sentimentally cheap tear jerker posing as an intellectually distinguished art film .  
  In Europe , it 's known as Who Dares Wins ; in America , it 's known as The Final Option , but under any title this ludicrous SAS action flick asks the audience to put their disbelief to one side for around two hours . I find it incredibly hard to comprehend how Lewis Collins ( the hero here ) was almost chosen as Roger Moore 's successor in the Bond films .. this guy is so expressionless he 'd struggle to get a job in a waxwork museum ( as a waxwork ! ) Luckily , Judy Davis is on hand to partially redeem the affair with a meaty performance as a hard-line lady terrorist , and there 's a climactic ten minute action sequence that is quite competently orchestrated by director Ian Sharp . Let it be added that it 's a very , very , very long wait for these closing excitements to come around , and I can't honestly say that a near two hour wait for a bit of decent action was worth the effort . SAS hard man Peter Skellen ( Lewis Collins ) goes undercover among a group of peace protesters who would like to see the end of nuclear weapons stock-piling . He meets their leader Frankie ( Judy Davis ) , a strong-talking and opinionated woman who might just be capable of taking extraordinary measures to achieve her goals . Frankie 's dedicated bunch violently lay siege to the American Embassy in London , demanding that a nuclear missile be fired at a naval base in Scotland ( she believes that when the world witnesses a nuclear blast for real , everyone will be so appalled that they will join her campaign for disarmament ) . Unfortunately for Frankie , she makes the mistake of taking Skellen on her little embassy raid , and he plans to thwart their plan from inside with a little well-timed outside help from his SAS comrades . The film is inspired - quite obviously - by the awesome SAS assault on the Iranian Embassy in 1981 . Someone who saw that event on the news apparently thought it would be good to devise a film along similar lines . Unfortunately , the film is rather banal , with too much stupid dialogue and a heck of a lot of embarrassingly bad scenes ( the arch-bishop 's debate which descends into a riot , anyone ? ) Frankie 's idea to bring about peace by instigating a nuclear blast is ridiculous anyway , so she becomes a laughable figure just when the audience is on the verge of viewing her as an interesting villain . Who Dares Wins tries to be a celebration of the military legend that is the SAS , but at the same time it dips into clumsy action clichés and ill-thought-out plotting . The result is a well-intentioned but wholly ineffective slice of Boy 's Own absurdity .  
  Well , I finally saw it . I didn't go when it first came out because , well , frankly , I was afraid . Afraid of how bad it might be , or how disappointing . While not as bad as Menace , and better than Clones , it wasn't particularly memorable , or satisfying . I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars . I still remember sitting in the theater . From the opening crawl to the final credits it was a movie experience I 'll never forget . A timeless story of the bored farm-boy who just knows he was meant for more , saving the princess and the Galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard , the rogue pirate and the various comic relief-all in a space-opera setting . And that 's not to chastise Lucas for using an old formula . It 's an old formula precisely because it works . And to his credit , he gave it new twists that made it very special . Then came Empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale . Darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time . The great villain , Vader was Luke 's father . Wow , no one saw that coming . Of course , I 'm convinced neither did Lucas till it showed up in the screenplay . Go back and watch Star Wars again . Knowing what you know now , particularly in light of the first three episodes , see if it really meshes . Which brings me to the problem I have . Revenge is an entertaining movie-tremendous effects , plenty of action , some good fighting scenes . But a movie still lives or dies on its plot-the story it is telling . Oh , certainly , really good acting can save a weak plot , but a weak plot coupled with bad acting-that 's a burden no director can overcome , certainly not one as bad as I 'm forced to realize George Lucas is ( The man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actors-Liam Neeson , Natalie Portman , Samuel Jackson ) . * SPOILERS AHEAD * The plot . Oh my . Understand , he 's already handicapped by what 's happened in the first two films so it 's an incredible burden . One too much for him to overcome . First we have the sheer absurdities of the background . We have Anakin being found as a child on Tatooine , the product of a virginal , miracle birth-the " chosen one " . Well , this detail never gets remotely explained . Indeed , the closest explanation is Yoda 's observation that maybe they were wrong . Oh , well , okay then . Our mistake . Now , this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of C3PO . Hey , what a coincidence that is . And he 'll come back to Tatooine and never know he was from there ? Wow ! How about that . Testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there , eh George ? Anyway , we have this bratty kid , moody , petulant , whining young adult , who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in Cinematic history-the great tragedy of Darth Vador-the good guy who falls from grace , only to finally achieve redemption in the end . How , pray tell , does this happen ? Why , he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth . Now , sure , he lives in a star-spanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline , but does it occur to the " dark one to be " to maybe check with a physician cause maybe , just maybe , this futuristic society might can do something about this problem ? Why , no , the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they 've been chasing for two films tells him that he 's got the secret to immortality . Well , of course he does . Sheesh . How can Lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it ? How can anyone expect us to care ? Hell , why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place . I wanted Kenobi to kill him not because he was evil , but because he was pathetically stupid . Oh , by the way , Amidala finally dies . In childbirth . Why ? Well , they don't know . The doctor , who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced , offers only the conclusion of " she 's lost the will to live " . Well , oh , okay , of course she has . Maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping with . But here we are . We have Kenobi present for all this . He knows of the birth of Luke and Leia . Knows who their father is and knows what happens to them . Knows , also , the role of both R2 and C3PO . And yet , in several years , as Luke approaches manhood and shows up with 3PO and R2 ( curiously , 3PO 's mind is wiped , but not R2's-why ? ) stating " I think these droids belong to you " , Kenobi , who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be " the chosen one " and apprentice to the Emperor himself , and who just happened to be built on this very planet , says " strange , I don't recall owning any droids " . Oh good grief . Lucas simply made this up as he went along . Once he introduced VAder as Luke 's father , sadly , the story began spinning out of control because HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE STORY WAS . The plot of Episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible . Nothing Palpatine did made any rational sense at all . And none of this ties into the story he originally told in Star Wars . It 's an afterthought , and it looks it . I can't give this movie a high rating . It reminds me of Triple X . A fun film to watch , but entirely forgettable . Star Wars will stand in my mind forever . Thankfully , this one , and the two preceding it , will soon fade .  
  I caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel , and was reminded of how terrible I thought it was in 1980 when first released . Many reviewers out there aren't old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King . The enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed " master " director put this multi-layered supernatural story on the screen . " Salem 's Lot " had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a TV mini-series , directed by Tobe Hooper ( he of " Texas Chainsaw Massacre " fame ) and was badly handled , turning the major villain of the book into a " Chiller Theatre " vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise . Fans hoped that a director of Kubrick 's stature would succeed where Hooper had failed . It didn't happen . Sure , this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments , it 's all downhill . Jack Nicholson cannot be anything but Jack Nicholson . He 's always crazy and didn't bring anything to his role here . I don't care that many reviewers here think he 's all that in this clinker , the " Here 's Johnny ! " bit notwithstanding .. he 's just awful in this movie . So is everyone else , for that matter . Scatman Crothers ' character , Dick Halloran , was essential to the plot of the book , yet Kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest " shock " sequences ever put on film . I remember the audience in the theater I saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick , those that stayed that is .. many left . King 's books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters , and often metaphysically . Kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately don't really care what happens to whom . This movie still stinks and why so many think it 's a horror masterpiece is beyond me .  
  This is a complete Hoax .. The movie clearly has been shot in north western Indian state of Rajasthan . Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian ; the writing all over is Hindi - language used in India . The drive through is on typical Jaipur streets . Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur , Rajasthan . The film-makers in their ( about the film ) in DVD Bonus seem to make it sound that they risked their lives shooting in Kabul and around . Almost all of their action scenes are shot in India . The scene where they see a group singing around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to Afgani folk song . They just recorded the Rajasthani folk song . How do I know it because I have traveled that area extensively . They are just on the band-wagon to make big on the issue . I do challenge the film makers to deny it .  
  Amateurish in the extreme . Camera work especially overwrought - documentary camera operators needn't spin around ALL THE TIME . The script is truly inane , and the acting is even worse . On top of that , the story is disjointed and meandering - with some gaping holes in logic . At one point the lead wishes to get thrown in jail in order to rub shoulders with suspected Al-Quada operatives , and thus get an interview with Osama . I found the story entirely unbelievable as a result of so many flaws . The " filmmaker " / lead role really portrays a rash , idiot frat boy . The only item of interest really , is that the filmmakers did in fact film on location . It 's truly a shame they wasted their opportunity to make something interesting . Who financed this crap ?  
  I liked Chiba in Street Fighter , and I figured hey , no matter how stupid this movie will be , I 'll at least get to see him kick some ass , right ? Wrong . This is a dull , dreary mess of pointless talking , half-assed scriptwriting and meaningless scheming . There are few action scenes of any kind , even fewer martial arts scenes , and the few that are are shot and edited so poorly that you can't even make out what in the world is going on . The dub is also atrocious , and perhaps the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it supposedly features the Italian Mafia .. EXCEPT THEY 'RE ALL Japanese ! Avoid like the plague-you would see better martial arts by looking through the window of your local preschool karate class for five minutes .  
  I had quite high hopes for this film , even though it got a bad review in the paper . I was extremely tolerant , and sat through the entire film . I felt quite sick by the end . Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema-I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen 's ' Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex , .. ' and Michael Hanneke 's ' Funny Games'-I found the directors ' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women 's milk totally sickening . And when the film climaxed in an " orgy " where the boy drinks both his mother 's milk , as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film , I almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is . Don't get me wrong , I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema , as well as independently made films , so this flick should have pleased me enormously . Avoid this film at all costs , it should be relegated to the annals of History as a lesson in bad cinema .  
  The main problem with " Power " is that it features way too may pointless characters and subplots that add absolutely nothing to the movie whatsoever . It gets boring after awhile , sitting around waiting through scenes that don't connect to find something that drives the movie forward . You could probably pass it all off as character development , but all of them are either recycled from earlier scenes in the movie , or are just simply to flat and uninteresting . Lumet never gives enough time to let any of the supporting cast blossom . He should have cut a few of the characters ( hackman , the wife ) and concentrated harder on others ( Billings ) . It could have been a great , hard political thriller instead of a jumbled mess that loses any message in a sea of bad writing and acting , a fact that amazed me considering the cast . Even Gene Hackman performance wasn't up to par . Denzel Washington is the only real actor of note here . Gere and the others have all done much better performances elsewhere . Sidney Lumet needs to go back to the fierce one man shows he did in the seventies ( i . e , Serpico ) and stop trying to recapture his success with " 12 Angry Men " and " Fail Safe " . It hasn't worked yet Sidney , and it most likely never will . leave the ensemble dramas to Altman . 3/10 * / * * * *  
  Primal Species comes from B Movie legend Roger Corman and as such everybody who watches this needs to realise that this is a Low Budget B Movie and it knows it . A bunch of terrorists high-jack a Lorry and kill an entire army doing so , they believe it to hold uranium , but No .. It contains two Dino 's with a taste for Human Flesh .. Then a Crack team , who might as well be called Delta Force get called in . OK , This ain't Jurassic Park , and Yes The Dino 's are never clearly seen because it 's obviously a guy in a Costume that 's not too dissimilar to Barney the Dinosaur - only slightly LESS terrifying , but come on guys this had about 1 % of Jurassic Park 's Budget and as such does what it can . Does this deserve to be in the bottom 100 ? .. HELL NO ! I think the nearly half of voters who give this a 1 - are being WAY WAY overly harsh , it 's much closer to a 4 .. it 's actually a lot better than a whole host of other movies not in the Bottom 100 , and has a similar production value to a Sci-Fi Channel Production . ( again Movies which get a overly harsh time from critics here on IMDb ) The acting is as expected in a B Movie although none of the actors take it that seriously , neither does the script All in All it 's an enjoyable B Movie - Not for Film Snobs * out of *  
  the lowest score possible is one star ? that 's a shame . really , i 'm going to lobby IMDb for a " zero stars " option . to give this film even a single star is giving WAY too much . am i the only one who noticed the microphones dangling over hopper 's head at the station ? and the acting , or should i say the lack thereof ? apparently talent wasn't a factor when the casting director came to town . my little sister 's elementary school talent show provides greater range and depth of emotion . and those fake irish accents were like nails on a chalk board . the only thing that could have made this movie worse would have been .. oh , wait , no , no , it 's already as bad as it can get .  
  The movie had a good concept , but the execution just didn't live up to it . What is this concept ? Well , story-wise , it 's " Dirty Harry " meets " M " . A child killer has begun terrorizing a city . The lead detectives ( Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest ) have never dealt with a serial killer before . The Mayor and the Police Chief , in desperation , secretly hire the local mob to speed things up .. to go places and do things that the police wouldn't be able to in order to bring an end to this mess as soon as possible . To be fair , this film DOES genuinely have some good things to offer . Besides the concept , I liked the look of the killer 's hideout . Norman Bates has his basement . This guy has an eerie sewer . In some of the shots , the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls ; often giving these scenes a creepy , dreamlike quality . The acting was good too . Dennis Hopper is one of those actors who gets better with age . Once you get past that , however , it more-or-less goes downhill . The film is paced way too fast . The actual investigation process from both teams feels very rushed as opposed to feeling intricate and fascinating . This could have been fixed in two ways : either make the film longer or cut out some of the many subplots . Either of these would have allowed the crew to devote more time to the actual mystery . For an example of how bad this is , one of the crucial clues that helps them zero in on just the right suspect is this : at one point in his life , the suspect went to a pet shop .. That 's right .. I 'm being totally serious here . It 's like they went from point A ( the first clue ) to point Z ( the suspect ) and skipped over all the " in-between " steps . Then there 's the characters . The only ones I actually liked were two pick-pockets you meet about half-way through the movie . Considering that they 're minor characters , I 'd call that a bad sign . Finally , there 's the mob angle . This is the one that gets me the most because THIS is why I coughed up the $ 3 to buy the DVD in the first place . I mean , what a hook ! There 's been an absolute glut of serial killer flicks in the last 10-15 years . The mob angle was a gimmick that COULD have helped it rise above the rest .. , but it didn't . I figured the gangsters 's methods would be brutal , but fun and thrilling at the same time ; kind of like a vigilante movie or something .. maybe they 'd even throw in some heist movie elements too . We ARE talking about criminals , after all . Instead , we 're given some of the most repulsive protagonists committed to celluloid . The detectives question witnesses . What does the mob do ? They interrogate and kill them . It 's not even like these witnesses are really even that bad either . I actually found the criminals less likable than the killer they 're hunting . Unless the good points I mentioned are enough to get your interest , I 'd say give this one a miss . Maybe some day , they 'll reuse the same story idea and do it RIGHT . I hope so . I hate to see such a good concept go to waste .  
  How Disney can you get ? Preppy rich girls act like idiots , buy a bunch of stuff , and get taught a lesson . Is Disney trying to send a lesson to itself ? That maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human ? Whatever the psycho-analysis , this movie sucked . The girls want a rich party for their rich lives . But then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant ( yes , milk ) going to employ the workers . They keep it afloat until daddy comes home . And the man at the beginning , who appears to be the one that takes the money , is the one . But the ending is dumb . Webcam in the Cayman Islands ? Huh ? Not worth my time ever again . But it is better than Howl 's Moving Castle . " D- "  
  Now please don't start calling me names like , " unpatriotic " , " weirdo " and more . The very length of this movie ( 4 hours .. ! ) is its biggest mistake . No editing at all - seems like J.P. Dutta fell in love with his project too much . Even Lagaan was 4 hours long - but it was entertaining and gave a message as well . It 's based on true incidents and real people . Kudos to it , but were the repetitive war scenes really needed ? On top of it the focus constantly shifted from one battalion / squadron to another and it was impossible to keep a track of them all . Between the skirmishes , there were songs about loneliness , lovesickness and related stuff . There were chummy conversations . In the beginning it gave some relief from the violence but became so monotonous later that one could even correctly predict nature of the forthcoming talk . Why were the soldiers walking around as if they were lions in jungle , fully unaware that enemy was lurking somewhere near ? And when they were shot , it elicited sympathy but it seemed unmindful of them to be so cocksure of their safety in the first place . Music was melodious and the lyrics were soulful but did not fit with the movie . Better to listen to them on the soundtrack rather than in the movie . Acting was the saving grace : From seasoned veterans like Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan , to relative newbies like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna , everyone acted like a pro . Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve a special mention for lightening up the mood whenever necessary . Dialogues ranged from brilliant ( " From Madhuri .. with Love ! " ) to illogical / monotonous ( " Pakistan se zyada musalman Hindusthan mein hain " ) . And the expletive spree consisting of all the MCs , BCs , Cs and F-words wasn't really required . LOC Kargil attempts to provide a fitting tribute to the brave Indian soldiers , but tries too hard and ultimately fails . Indian soldiers surely deserve a better tribute .  
  I saw this on cable recently and kinda enjoyed it . I 've been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half . Personally , I enjoyed the first story ( too bad that wasn't extended . ) The second story , I thought , was cliched . And that " California Dreaming , " if I hear that one more time .. Chungking Express is alright , but it 's not something that mainstream audiences will catch on to see , like " Crouching Tiger . "  
  I am completely baffled as to why this film is even liked , let alone held in such high regard , especially by so many critics who are , otherwise , quite sensible . There is one key word which describes this film to its core - irritating . The most easily explained example of this is the director 's use - or , more accurately , abuse - of music . In the first half , a really dull reggae tune is played about three times ( when once is too often ) . But in the second half , The Mommas And The Papas " California Dreamin ' " is played at least seven times , usually at top volume . Godsakes , whether you liked the song or not beforehand , you 'd be thoroughly sick of it by the end . Just think , some people claim to have seen this film four or five times . This means they 've listened to California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times .. All of this needless hyper-repetition ( it contributes nothing to the story ) could possibly be excused if the remainder of the film had any lingering merit , or if the story was in any way involving . But it ain't . The only aspect I found likeable was Bridgette Lin 's charging around and still playing Asia The Invincible in a raincoat and sunnies . Even this wore off fairly quickly . I 'm sure this film 's undeserved high reputation will convince many poor suckers to go and see it . I can only warn you - if you 've never seen a HK movie before , don't start with this one . If you feel compelled to watch it , avoid at all costs seeing it in a cinema . The fast-forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here . You have been warned !  
  Average viewers looking for any sense of internal coherence in a film should probably give this one a pass . It generates the same feeling as staring at a curious array of individual images that seem to have some relationship one to another , but never coalesce into a totality . While this isolative approach to creating a kind of cinematic montage may appeal to a few students or critics steeped in the inside language of contemporary filmmaking , it is flatly irritating and condescending to us commoners who just fell off the haywagon . An overt avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional hallmark of auteurs like Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino , but to me it comes across as Andy Warhol warmed over . The only redeeming characteristic I find is in the production values , and them there just ain't going to cut it all by themselfs . This is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes . Sorry . The calligraphic credits unexpectedly begin to roll just as your interest begins to stir . I get the same big yawn and let-down reading what I guess are very knowledgeable and thorough comments about this film that never lead to anything truly comprehensible . Ideas and images without some external context are not my idea of fun . Call me a philistine roaming the streets of Hong Kong looking for a bowl of chop suey .  
  This is one of the worst B slashers I 've ever seen in my life . The ending is something you have to see to believe . The movie starts with Harry Standing and Phillip Standing sitting on the stairs with their mother watching their father come down the chimney while dressed in a Santa suit . He puts the presents under the tree , eats the cookies and milk and then goes back up the chimney . Phillip goes to bed but Harry comes down only to find his father dressed in a Santa suit sexually pleasuring his mother . Then , Harry goes up stairs , smashes a snow globe , grabs a shard of glass , and cuts himself . Then you move on to the present . You see Harry . He is a lonely man who sleeps in a Santa suit and watches little kids through a pair of binoculars . He has two books . One book for good kids and the other for bad kids . He writes down everything they do in these books . The guy is a creep . He also works at the Jolly Dream toy factory . His brother Phillip has a family and two kids and lives in a nice house . When Harry finds out that his boss only cares about profits , he goes and collects all the toys and delivers them to a few kids . Then , he travels to a church and kills 4 people . Then he goes to another house and puts presents under the tree . The kids catch him but they go back to bed . So , Harry goes to the bedroom and kills the father and leaves . As he is walking towards a house , a bunch of kids spot him and run up to him . The parent 's are nervous and try to get their kids to come back to them so they don't get hurt . How do they know that Harry is the killer ? Sure , you have to be suspicious because you never know who it could be . Harry gives the kids presents and the father pulls out a switch blade in an attempt to stab him in front of the kids . When Harry runs off , the townsfolk light torches and follow him to kill him . They don't even know that he is the killer . When Harry reaches his brother 's house , his his brother and him have a little talk and Phillip strangles him . He only loses consciousness . Phillip loads Harry back into his van . When Harry wakes up , he takes off . The ending is something I could not believe . Once again , you 'll have to see it to believe it . One thing that bugged me was the black Santa . That 's right , the man in the Santa suit they saw was a white man . So why did they bring in a black man ? Skip this and see Silent Night Deadly Night and Santa 's Slay . You 'll get your money 's worth seeing those two films . They are better than this pile of garbage ! I give this movie 1 star out of 10 . Wish I could give it 0 stars cause that is what this movie deserves .  
  The only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh . I had high hopes as I usually love bad campy holiday horror movies , but this just didn't qualify . It 's really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity , which again , isn't a bad plot , but is done poorly here . There are some scenes ( such as the ending ) which are not intended to be funny , but actually made me laugh out loud . There were a couple of times when I thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction , but it never fulfills what it could and should be . In my opinion , if you are looking for a Christmas slasher flick , try Silent Night , Deadly Night .  
  there was some truth to this movie . I remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fisherman finding a body in the water and they chose not to report it until their trip was finished . I also recall they were charged with interfering with a corpse ( or some such charge ) . I 'm not sure if it was in Australia . The viewers outside of Australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders . Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this perception . The film itself reminded me of A Simple Plan . But as far a being one of the best Australian films ever , as someone claimed , I can't be that generous . Put it this way , I wouldn't bother watching it again .  
  This film is terrible . I was really looking forward to it , as I thought " Lantana " was great . The following review may contain * spoilers * * First , the good things : it looks great , some of the performances are OK . The bad things are everything else about it . The story , as you possibly know , is about some blokes who go fishing and discover a body , with the twist that they find it on Friday but continue fishing and finally report it on Sunday when they get back into mobile ( cell phone ) range . However the film takes it 's time ( boy does it take its time ) getting to this central event . Of the ensemble of characters ( about a dozen ) , not one seems to like another one ( which is , I suppose , consistent , because they are all unlikable ) . I was extremely frustrated by the failure to adequately explain how the characters are related , and it was not until near the end of the movie that I could vaguely construct the family tree . It 's hard to think of a film us unrelentingly grim , which is a failure in the structure of the story , as the character 's lives seem just as bad before the fishing trip as after . Once you 've set the bar so high , it 's hard to up-it short of everyone committing suicide . There are silly lapses in logic . The killer dumps the body in the lake , and then it somehow drifts miles upstream into the mountains . The fishermen walk out Sunday morning , but for some reason Byrne gets home late at night after his wife has gone to bed . Then first thing the next morning the cops bang on the door to get him to come down to the station . Um , they haven't heard of the telephone ? Down at the station , the media know the whole story , less than 24 hours after they reported the body ? Totally missing from the story is the debate the blokes surely had after they find the body . This is a mystery - everyone asks them " how could you do that ? " and the audience is asking the same question . ( The debate about what to do with the body is the key scene in " Deliverance " ) . I know exactly what I 'd do in their situation . Someone needs to walk out to the car , drive to mobile range , call the cops , wait , and them guide them back to the location . If the others wait at camp and fish , who cares ? A lot of all this just seems false . The only thing that rung true was that , as the girl was black , the local aboriginals seized on the fishermen 's actions as racist - " wouldn't have done it if it was a white girl . " Throughout there is a curious indifference to who might have killed the girl ( I think the subject is mentioned once ) , and there is no mystery , as the audience sees the killer in the opening scene . So I 'm sitting there simultaneously bored and confused , when there 's a twist - not in the plot , but the theme . Suddenly it becomes about the quiet dignity of the bereaved aboriginals leading to a ludicrous ending with some incoherent stuff about black-white reconciliation . Huh ? This is Australian film " at its finest " , according to The Age .  
  Somewhere , buried very deep inside this film is a half-way decent movie trying to get out . The only traces are a few early scenes in Los Angeles ( in a bar and a graveyard ) and thereafter a couple of pieces of production design . Like I say , buried very deep . One of the biggest challenges faced by movies involving the supernatural is how to have characters react believably in unbelievable situations . Annie Mcenroe 's reaction to being told that her sister ( presumably Dee Wallace from the first movie ) is ( was ? ) a werewolf is , if I recall , along the lines of ; " Oh ! Really ? " . Not one of the better responses to said challenge . The non sequitirs continue as the story moves to Trannsylvania in search of Stirba the ( apparently self-appointed ) " Queen of the Werewolves " . As Stirba , Sybil Danning is the two best things in the movie . Yes , even better than the werewolf group-sex scene , Reb Brown 's acting , and the oddly simian-looking werewolf suits . The end credits have assumed minor legend status and are available in all their glory ( at least until the censor finds them ) on Youtube . Check them out to see why and remember , the whole film makes about the same amount of sense . If you happen to catch this on US television the credits have been re-edited to replace the endlessly repeated shot of Danning ripping off her top with another endlessly repeated shot of her ripping open a cloak only this time she has some kind of top on underneath . It 's a sort of absurdity , cherry-on-top moment which defies satire .  
  I think that the shots and lighting were very poor . When I watched it for the first time I thought it was the old version ( 1956 ) . When I really found out the true year of the film I was shocked . I didn't know that there could be such a bad film made so recently . Thats really all I wanted to say . This film had a good plot though , nothing you couldn't miss out on if you would simply read the novel that George Orwell wrote . All I really want to say has already been said except for this : I can't believe that this film could have possibly received so many awards and nominations . I gave this film a One ( awful ) , because I felt that it was very badly made . Well that is all . So long  
  Back in the 70 's , when I had first seen this , I was in high school . It was cool then . Now as an adult I look back at it and I say to myself .. yeah right . What was so funny ? It has it 's moments but they are few and far between . It is so dated that the jokes no longer stand up . Show this to a younger crowd and they will be totally lost . If you like this type of humor you may want to stick with Kentucky Fried Movie or Amazon Women From The Moon . Tunnel Vision as well as Groove tube are too dated for today 's viewing .  
  This is a formula B science fiction movie , and the director made no bones about it . It is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team . Everything done is stuff you 've seen many times before . It is a weak script , with no real characters . In fact , it is full of stereotype characters and situations . The director attacks this by just making it a formula movie , with no attempt to fool us , and that gives this movie a mild appeal , but it isn't something you 're likely to remember a while . It is best seen while you 're cooking , cleaning , working out . Sort of mindless fun . It has its place in entertainment , but it certainly isn't something you sit down with friends to watch , unless you 're all just drunk and don't care . The mass rating of 3.2 is probably fair . I don't think it is as crappy as most people , but I am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular . That really eludes me , as I see no attempt to even make this a memorable film .  
  The bad out takes from " Reign of Fire " strung together , without any real story . Dean Cain tries to be a real actor , and fails again . In the end the dragons quit in disgust . BARF !  
  I do agree that though this story by Melville just might be unfilmable , this isn't even a credible try . To move the story into the 20th century just outrages the original story 's intent and nature ; possibly you might have been able to move it over to England , but it must be a period piece . Even our story narrator-the proprietor-tells it in a flashback , going back even further , somewhere around 1800 . Towards the end of the 19th century , a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without a thought . And the 20th century ? Come on ! Give me an expletive deleted break ! Even around 1800 , such behavior didn't work very well , in view of the ending . And the movie 's ending ? I don't know what it was , because I didn't watch the entire travesty-I had to stop . This was like setting " Streetcar Named Desire " in Elizabethan England .  
  I think this is probably one of the worst movies I 've watched in a long time . Trying to get the ' same characters ' with different people is * such * a bad idea . If they couldn't get Sara Michelle G . and Ryan P . in this one , they should have just cut their losses and said to heck with it . Instead they get NEW actors that are horrible at what they did . I seriously felt like I was at a High School or ( bad ) College play with the lever of acting these people put forth . Where do they get some of these people ? Was this their first movie ? It sure seemed like it . This movie also parallels the original in a few lines of speech . I had just got done watching the first one and popped # 2 in . I was all excited to get to watch the second one and it ended up being the worst show I 've seen in a while . I don't hardly EVER * EVER * turn off a movie , but this one definitely went off after about 30 - 40 min .  
  What can I say about Cruel intentions 2 ? Well , I can say in all honesty , I will only watch this film again if I am fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork-orange-style . The film ' stars ' Robin Dunne ( No , I never heard of him either ) , whose awful impression of Ryan Phillipe made me cringe throughout . In a case of terrible casting , Dunne attempts ( and fails ) to carry off playing a handsome charismatic , charmer . Since the actor is not handsome , nor charismatic nor charming , the character is left wholly unbelievable . Amy Adams , ( she was in an episode of buffy one time ) , tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine to life .. However , Adams is not that good a an actress and her performance was flat and lacking in any real emotion , often she looked like she was reading cue cards just off camera . There were two good actors in the film however , Barry Flatman ( Saw 2 & Saw 3 ) and Mimi Rogers ( Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers ) , made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the only reason why I rated the film as a 2 , not a 1 . The film itself is a poor version of the original , with such lows as carbon copy 's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which lacked the originality of the previous film . I think that as a TV show , it might have worked , but if it had been recasted with people who could actually act in the main parts .  
  This so-called prequel is just a badly made remake to to a better version of Dangerous Liasons . The plots are identical as is most of the script . I loved the book its based off of , and I loved the first movie , but I 'm not even going to bother with the 3rd movie . The pointless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal , and .. I just can't stress how bad the movie was . If you don't want to take my word for it , just watch it , and you 'll see what I mean . If you 've read a review that says that ' If you likes the first one , you 'll like the second one ' the only reason that is is because IT IS THE EXACT SAME MOVIE ! Although the plot is not even as good . They took so many lines from the first movie , Its hard to tell which movie you 're watching .  
  The Fiendish Plot of Dr . Fu Manchu starring Peter Sellers in a spoof of the characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice to the end of Sellers ' career . The plot was very simplistic , and if done the right way could have been handled nicely , but instead it was poorly executed . Part of the reasons why this film wasn't that good was the poor dialog , cheap laughs , choppy directing , and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incomplete . The acting , on the other hand , was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up picture . I found Sellers portrayal of diabolical Manchu brilliantly done , with the occasional lines that will be remembered . For example , there is the scene where Fu Manchu is confused which henchman is which in which he says " Ah , you all look the same to me . " I hate to admit it , but I laughed out loud with that line . Then of course a fistful of strong supporting characters really caught my attention with the likes of Helen Mirren as the backstabbing constable , David Tomilson as Sir Roger Avery ( his last film as well , not a way to end a career ) , and Sid Ceasar ( who gives a rather whimsical performance of Al Capone 's relative who works for the FBI ) . These characters also kept me watching . The sets were also nice . Oriental designs and English society in 1933 was depicted with elegance in this dud of a picture . In all honesty , my advice to you is to watch the film if you are a Peter Sellers or Sid Ceasar fan . Otherwise , you 're better off settling on chewing aluminum foil .  
  I rented this movie about 3 years ago , and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made . I don't think I ever finished it . It is worse than a home video made by a high school student . I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt , oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV , like a Toyota Rav-4 or something ( I don't remember ) . I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s . He might have had a cell phone too , I cant remember , It was just horrible . I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back . To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen , and I have seen some pretty bad ones .  
  I own this movie . Not by choice , I do . I was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me . So i popped it in the old VCR and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying " why God why ? " . The story-line was not that bad , as an gamer I could appreciate bits of it . I think that maybe if you 're into super geeky-cheese romantic scenes you 'll enjoy this film . " I always thought of myself as a Vulcan you know like Dr . Spock .. unable to love " There is very few good things to say about this film , truly it is awful . But if you 're up to really badly made film this is the one for you ! The real story 's much more interesting though ; ) If I had to sum up this film in one word it would be : LAME  
  Many things become clear when watching this film : 1 ) the acting is terrible . Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so-so , but the parent-child conflict borders soap opera-ish . The other two boys : an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical I'm a babe but I'm really sensitive inside blonde dreamboat ; 2 ) the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing ; 3 ) Robbie 's dreams and episodes are disturbing ( acted by Tom Hanks ) ; 4 ) the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice ( " we are all special friends " ) ; 5 ) the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting ; and 5 ) this is a really bad movie . Expect to be disappointed-and probably disturbed .  
  This sequel is a total rehash of the first film . A completely pointless movie . It basically just took every single sceanrio of the first film and they redid it in Omen IV except with a female antichrist this time . It even ends the same way as the first one ! The music is too busy and interfering , and because its pretty much a copy of Omen I , it 's extremely predictable . It 's not a horrible movie , it 's not terribly made , there is much worse movies out there , this just had absolutely no point in being made . The Omen remake from 2006 is much worse , even more pointless than this , so I guess it has that . If you someone pointed a gun to your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 reamke , I guess I 'd choose this .  
  I don't know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site ! I 'm a big vonnegut fan and am very familiar with the story this Showtime original film bastardized beyond belief , but even if I wasn't , the poor acting , VERY poor casting ( Sean Astin as the brilliant , athletic , and all around individual , Harrison ? The guy 's completely generic ! ) and sub-standard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable . Someone pointed out how cute that Maculay Culkin line was . If you read that and thought that was pure comic brilliance ( sadly , it probably was the most INTENTIONALLY funny part of the movie ) , maybe you 'll like this movie . But if you 're a Vonnegut fan or not completely insane , don't see it . Please .  
  Im still in doubt if this is just a horrible movie or the worse movie i ever saw . Actors are painful and its impossible to get into the text . Don't waist your time into this movie .

  VERY BAD MOVIE .. and I mean VERY BAD .. THe plot is predictable , and it 's EALLY cheesy , the creativeness of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason I didn't give the movie a one , other than that .. this is def a movie one can def afford not to watch .. I feel while watching the movie , the idea behind the movie was an interesting one tho kind of cliché .. bringing country bumpkins to the city blah blah blah , but I feel it might have been at least a little better if it just wasn't so cheesy , very poorly portrayed from idea to screen , i think . The Plot is somewhat predictable at times , tho the dancing I can say AT TIMES , is pretty good , The break dance battle twist was good .. IF u just pop the movie and watch the dance scenes and make up your own dialog maybe it can be a 5 .. lol  
  .. and Ethel Merman buffs , too , will love her loud , bossy vocals as the wicked witch Mombi , but this cartoon sequel to " The Wizard Of Oz " is bereft of real imagination , substituting fantasy and excitement with noisy action ( and cheaply repeating its footage like a bad music video ) . Little Dorothy is whisked back to Oz , which has gone to ruin , and meets old and new friends . The inelegant animation is stuck somewhere between the weakest Walt Disney and the less-inspired shows from Hanna-Barbera , however many of the songs are good , particularly Dorothy 's sweet lament " It 's a Far Away Land " , superbly performed by Liza Minnelli . You can count on Minnelli for energy , which is why the movie perks up whenever Dorothy is around . Much of it is unmemorable , and I 'm not even sure baby-boomers will get a charge from it since it has been out of circulation for so long . As a curiosity item , just fair . * from *  
  This absolute trash is based so closely on the Friday the 13th series that is practically a carbon copy , accept for it being an Australian film with people who can't act . Once upon a time a young boy got burnt up accidentally during the filming of a music video at Lake Eildon . Now , a number of years later , the boy is all grown up and taking revenge on anybody who comes to the lake to film a music video . It is cliche-ridden and a waste of time and money , see it only out of curiosity , or if you 're an aspiring actor trying to learn how NOT to ( not be able to ) act . Lead role Alan Dale used to star in the television soap opera Neighbours , but ended up in The X Files - how did THAT happen ?  
  I 'd never heard of this , then found out it 's the man with the deadly lens , which I 'd heard of but not seen . Connery 's presence drove me to buy it , and it 's not good . It wants to be a sort of cross between Dr Strangelove and Mash , but it just isn't that funny , unless you find the name General Wombat ( ? ) funny . It comes across as a flat 70s thriller until the last ten minutes , when it springs to life . There are many , many flat scenes in the Whitehouse between the president and his aides which don't work . It 's almost as if the initial cut was too long , and the first half was edited down to get to the whole nuclear bomb ransom storyline and the suicide bomber attacks , which i think are meant to be played for laughs , but again , aren't that funny . The location filming is excellent but the studio stuff looks like cheap TV . I could not believe the man responsible for Key Largo , Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did this . Only laugh : Connery throws away his wig before putting on his helmet and jumping out of a plane . It makes Never say Never again look like genius .  
  Here 's an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase " low budget " a horrible name . Our physics teacher who has about nine kids creates a strange serum that causes " molecular reorganization " . Students are hopelessly killed from fake coincidences of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies . Sounds like a resurrection of classic B-movies from the 50s , right ? Nope ! It 's not an example of high camp fun , which is way , WAY off the mark . A glamorous showcase of breasts and butts ensues our desire for pleasure , opposing the horror that should have had 99.44 % more in the first place . Bottom of the barrel entertainment at its best , aided by pints of red blood and dead student bodies . Atrocious movies like this would make the ultimately catastrophic GURU THE MAD MONK ( 1970 ) the work of an intelligent genius who has a Master 's degree in film production ! It 's an automatic " F " , so rest easy !  
  I can't believe I watched this expecting more . It starts out OK . This movie pushes the limits of reality way to far ! At least the first one was somewhat realistic . It rips off the first movie and even mentions the Joshua Project . Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie . It does have one good message in it though , WATCH OUT FOR BIG BROTHER ! The movie just makes it seem like Big Brother is way bigger than he actually is in reality . That was very aggravating . Even the make-up on the actors was completely bad . Some of the acting is pretty good . Some of the acting is really bad though . The script was OK at some points and completely messed up at other parts . This movie plays on convenience about every five minutes . Like I said , I can't believe I watched it expecting more . I think I am gonna pop in the original to get back to earth .. Q  
  This is one of the worse movies that I have ever seen in my entire life . I wish I could travel back in time and do the following : 1 ) Find out where the " movie " " War Games - The Dead Code " was filmed 2 ) Watch the original WAR GAMES with my current computer knowledge AND the eyes of a 1983 preteen . 3 ) Break into the pentagon computer in the 80 's with the knowledge and perspective learned and remembered . 4 ) Reprogram the WHOPPER to NUKE the location of THE DEAD CODE minutes prior to its first day of filming 5 ) Come back to the present , have a beer and get Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to " flash " my memory blank of the whole event , especially my original viewing of " The Dead Code " 6 ) Have another beer and watch WARS GAMES 7 ) Be happy until the next bad remake of a GOOD 80 's movie . 8 ) Did I forget the have Jar Jar killed . I am not sure if I would have to travel into the future for that . Maybe I need access to a wormhole .  
  In the recent movement to bring Asian films over to America , this is THE LAST movie that should be released here . Being a big fan of asian movies from all genres , I was browsing the net and came across this soong to be re-released into the US market so I decided to check it out ahead of time and rent this at a local video store . Trust me .. the action scenes are incredibly disappointing , Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey completely blew this movie out of the water . Jet Li would fall asleep watching the fighting sequences . If you 're looking for martial arts entertainment , your time would be better off with a Jackie Chan flick ! Moreover .. you think you 're going to watch a martial arts with about a girl engulfed in vengence for her parents death BUT SURPRISE ! A good hour of this movie in the middle has is filled with dialogue , an absense of action , the lack of devloping a tangent plot , pretty much NOTHING to do with the premise we are exposed to . It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy , and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer / director dedicated no time in elbaorating , and yet dedicated a portion of the film dragging the issue . Would of been much better off if they had just cut that whole hour and developed the story in itself through another film and focus on the martial arts aspect . Speaking of which , I really don't believe the choreographer of Iron Monkey , did the action sequence in Princess Blade . I was completely insulted in the frequent usage of slow motion and quick camera changes to portray the assassins physical swiftness . I just didn't buy it . Please .. I 'm warning you to PLEASE do not waste your time / money with this movie . The premise is intrigueing , and the trailer might even tempt you but I am positive that this movie is NOT suited for the public ( maybe in Japan but not in the states ) and will be the worst film brought over to the states from the Asian film industry .  
  Whatever rating I give BOOM is only because of the superb location photography of Sardinia and Rome . Otherwise , this is only for hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR ( her downward phase ) , and RICHARD BURTON ( his miscasting phase ) . Tennessee Williams wrote " The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore " and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play-but apparently , he was the only one . Taylor reportedly hated it and Burton needed the money . Whatever , it amounts to a hill of beans with Taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner , exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby-talk with no less than NOEL COWARD who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears . It 's so campy that among Taylor fans it 's probably considered a " must see " kind of thing . But if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand , you 're way ahead of me . Sadly , this is the film that signified the end of Taylor being taken seriously as a film actress , even after winning two Oscars . For Burton , it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a BOMB . Judge for yourself if you dare .  
  Occasionally one is served a new entrée from foreign films . That is their great attraction . They take from life and serve it up raw . American films , rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society . Too many hang-ups and a morbid fear of financial failure . The Almighty dollar , determines their selections . Something which invites European directors . In addition , audiences world wide remain hungry for " different " films , especially those which offer a savory bite out of the wretched , suffering body of humanity . Despite the fear of directors or producers , many audiences yearn for beauty , poetry , and the pristine flavor of life . That is what the film " To the Left of the Father " offers to curious audiences . A family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it 's obedience to tradition . Yet when the patriarch of a family forgets it 's members are flesh and blood humans , filled with raging , unbridled dreams and dark passions , then the two are set in motions against itself . Selton Mello plays André a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father . Raul Cortez plays his Father . Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters . Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro , the elder brother . The film offers much , but does takes an extremely inordinate amount of time to say it . *  
  Despite what a lot of other people thought about the first movie , I really liked it . This one however . How to sum it up in one word ? : This movie is ( and here comes the word ) : CRAP ! But let 's look at it part by part : Here is the plot : Finally the old queen has been removed from her castle , but her successor : Snow white has problems of another sort : The Court-Jester , Father of her son , has gone astray , as the super , Spliss , goes to the extreme , to battle his gray hair and sells the royal offspring for some blond and full hair . In her desperation Snow white seeks the help of Bubi ( Otto Walkees ) , who must first find his other six dwarf companions and then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name of Rumpelstiltskin . The whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend , where the writers were very drunk but were just under pressure from the studio to write the screenplay . Yes , there are some good jokes . Even for fans of the first part , or for fans of any of the other actors , it 's really not worth buying the the DVD . Believe me . The only thing , that at least kind of saves the movie from complete oblivion , are the performances of some of the actors . That 's why I gave the move 3/10 . Sadly , the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them combined can make up for the bad story . For example , at one point , they even cross over in our reality , and sadly .. they don't do anything funny while being here . Still , a lot of great actors in this movie : Otto Waalkes , Ralf Schmitz , Martin Schneider , Nina Hagen , Cosma Shiva Hagen , ( Especially funny ) : Rüdiger Hoffmann as the mirror , Helge Schneider and many more but sadly all these comedians aren't able to bring this really bad script to life . Maybe it is a treat for some hardcore fans but for regular movie goers or by now DVD Renters or buyers it 's not worth the money . I even regret renting the movie .  
  I hate this programme : not only is the very concept ludicrous , but it tries so hard to be feasible ( something that was left out of similar " I confess " ending programmes like , Muder : She Wrote ) . Sigh . Why is it that the writers can't ever be intelligent enough in this programme to come up with evidence that would stick and win a decision in court ? Come on : after X-amount of years of the cases being unsolved , why must EVERY SUSPECT , EVERY EPISODE * CONFESS * ( damn it ! ) to a murder which would otherwise go unsolved ? I bet all police wish that criminals were this good sportsmen : " Aw , shucks , officer , you 're a bright one - I guess if you 've uncovered enough to convince yourself I did it , I may as well admit to it and make it easier for you in court . What can I say ? It 's a fair cop . " Absolute dog s * t and an insult to those of us with with enough brains to even have heard of I.Q.  
  It 's pretty clear that the director and production crew set out to paint a less than flattering picture of the Palestinian girl and her family . The film and it 's website tries to imply that Ayat has a secret reason for blowing herself and Rachel up - a boyfriend problem - perhaps pregnancy . Neatly glossed over is the fact that Ayat had herself just witnessed the death of a close friend at the hands of the Israelis'-just outside her home . Gosh , so why on earth would a young , pretty , intelligent girl with plans for college go and do such a thing ? Could it be that the hormonal , emotional teenager was traumatized by seeing seeing someone she loved die before her very eyes ? This detail merits all of 5 seconds in the movie . Another neatly sidestepped detail is that Avigail Levy , Rachels ' mother , could have prevented the destruction of the building the Akhras family lived in ( along with 22 other families ) . One distinctly gets the impression that she 's offering this as a " concession " - should Mrs . Akhras agree to speak with her . " why should I ? " she says . ( since the movie was made the home has been destroyed - apparently the interview didn't result in what she wanted - so bring on the bulldozers ) Mrs Levy claimed that she " wanted the movie to be cathartic as well as a symbol of hope , a chance to transcend entrenched hatreds " - instead she uses it as an excuse to harangue Ayats mother , while dangling the house as a carrot . Moreover although the two women live only 4 miles apart , she is so out of touch with the realities of the occupation for her Palestinian neighbors , that she really thinks that Mrs . Akhras can just drop over for a cup of coffee ? Please . And she forgoes the one chance she had to meet Mrs . Akhras in person and see what kind of life she lives . ( the Akras family originally came from Jaffa , but now live crammed into a refugee camp only 4 miles from where the Levys live in comparative luxury . Any sympathy I would have had for the obviously well to do Mrs . Levy is dissolved by her air of self-righteous bitchiness . By contrast , Ayats mother comes off as kind , forthright and loving - in spite of the best efforts by the post production crew to paint her and her family as monsters . Heck even the music and sound design was one sided - I guess the muezzin sings ALL day every day 4 miles from the Levy family home , always in a sharply contrasting key from the sappy new-age music that scores this drab excuse for a documentary . Also there is the small matter of translations - Mrs . Levy DIRECTLY addresses the camera in English when she has something worked out to say ahead of time , Hebrew when she doesn't . Mrs . Akhras spoke only Arabic which received sometimes a TRANSLATION , sometimes TRANSLITERATION , always awkward , and very suspect for a supposedly objective movie . They also " sweated " her under the lights , while Mrs . Levy sat in ( air conditioned ) comfort . Rotten editing for Mrs . Akhras ' segments too . I gave it a 2 because I liked Ayats mother and father , who seemed like good decent people . Shame on HBO , producers and director , for releasing such a stink-bomb .  
  Welcome to Our Town , welcome to your town ? As we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of 1901 America , this three act play is opened before us with the help of " The Stage Manager " , a visual narrator if you like . After his initial introductions , we are lead into the homes of two particular families ; The Webb 's and the Gibb 's . This is most definitely middle America at the turn of the century , and the progressive way of life of the American Dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town . Here we see the everyday lives of some of its 2642 populace of Grover 's Corners , New Hampshire , even if there are , too , the migrant Polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers , they , never get a look-in . Once the daily lives of these families have been introduced ; wives cooking , children home-working , fathers working , kids falling in love and the clean picket-fences painted white , the second act is started three years later , after young George ( a young and unrecognisable William Holden , then aged 22 ) and Emily have fallen in love and intend to marry . Blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching , too , a turning point in their own lives , from the nest they lived and now , into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step . The third act is slightly more sour and foreboding , it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent , here we see not life , not celebration but death , and it is in this predicament that the dead , as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past , are here to remind us , to tell us , that life , and every last minute , every precious breath is not to be wasted and squandered . It is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too , feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on , and by , middle America and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order . This isn't just about " Our " town , this is moral diction aimed at " Our " souls and how America can better itself if its peoples ' , ( excluding the Poles , the Irish , the Native American and the freed ethnic minorities ' , and minorities ' in general , plus the supporting backbone of the Americana 's who , still , have not had a fair part in this narrative ) , such as the middle classes , can live up to the expectations of the American Dream through honest , decent living . The purveyors of the American Dream with special invitation only . I was entertained , slightly , by this movie too , but I felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting , the musical score or how well , or not , it was made . This was the movies intention to exclude other groups , and to only include the likes of the Webb 's and the Gibb 's , in the future of the developing country of the USA , a good movie , but also a slightly biased in its stance , I thought . Taken from the play by US ' born Thornton Wilder ( 1897 - 1975 ) this Pulitzer Prize winning play , and six Academy Award nominated movie , was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes ; Life , love and death , the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness . Our Town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness , like other towns , nothing too exciting ever happens here , if anything at all , this town only has the " right sort of people " , you can still leave your back-door unlocked here , we are seeing the developing lives of these two families , but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves . Our Town may just have been " Any Town " , just as long as you came from the right part of town that is .  
  Just too many incidents of violence . The film goes from one scene to another , and in nearly every one violence erupts . Now I am not one who is shocked by violence , and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing . But , please , not one after another . My reaction was not shock or horror , it was : " Here we go again . " There is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence , but two thirds of the way through the film I had switched off completely , and couldn't wait for the end . If this is the best the film makers can do , they should find something else to do with their miserable lives , like making shoes or delivering mail .  
  Relentlessly stupid , no-budget " war picture " made mainly to show off the attributes of the spectacular Eve Meyer-not a bad idea in itself-but that should be an embarrassment to everyone connected with it . Laughable " script " , performances that wouldn't pass muster in an elementary-school Christmas pageant , inept " action " scenes , confused direction by the normally competent documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen-who is apparently not quite sure if he 's making a comedy , a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a leering T & A ( by early 1960s standards , anyway ) travelogue of Eve Meyer 's magnificent body-and a general air of shoddiness and incompetence . Worth seeing in order to watch Eve Meyer strut her stuff , but that 's pretty much it .  
  I don't think I 'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie I 've ever seen . I 've been working on a list of my favorite war movies : " The Longest Day , " " To Hell and Back , " " Bridge on the River Kwai , " ( all black and white ) which all have good plots , rich characters and great acting . I 've seen better dialog and acting in student-written high school one act plays . The plot , however isn't a bad premise - just poorly implemented . It 's kind of like a traffic accident , though , I couldn't seem to turn it off ! A movie doesn't need big money or great sets i . e . " Twelve Angry Men " and " Lifeboat " to be good .. so budget is no excuse . What were they thinking ?  
  This film had such promise ! What a great idea , an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory , only to lose it 's speed due to bad dialoge , poor editing and a half-written story . The characters in the beginning were interesting , only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people sputtering out tired one-liners . Maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge it would have been a great movie , instead of a almost afterthought effort .  
  Anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics . Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films to begin at , which is fine but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie , SOYLENT GREEN , are far better choices than those series . SOYLENT is probably science fiction ' s best kept secret . It remains one of the biggest , yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day . Charlton Heston overdramatizes his role , yet it works . Edward G . Robinson , in his final role , makes the most out of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching . It is Manhattan in 2022 , the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune ( a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150 ) . A big executive for the Soylent company is murdered and police detective Thorn is on the case . The secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie . SOYLENT is enjoyable to watch , but the whole screenplay is a joke . It is just as cheap as the entire production . The screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie , yet were completely hilarious . Everyone seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules , specifically cop Thorn who likes to just waltz into people ' s apartments , peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants . The character ' s interactions keeps your attention on the movie , but still you realize that SOYLENT GREEN sucks . An enjoyable piece if you have the time , but do not expect anything more .  
  Power rangers , the moronic merchandising television kids show from the 1990s , has got to be the most pointless and ridiculous television show ever created . What exactly is the point of this show anyway , other than to sell second rate plastic nonsense to children ? There is nothing even remotely redeeming or interesting about this show in anyway . Look at the costumes , which look like spandex gone bad . The mullet style hair , earrings , and fashions of the early 1990s look completely ridiculous these days . Avoid this show at all costs !  
  This movie seems to send the wrong message . There can be morality without using Christ . Poeple of other religions , I believe , can get into heaven . I am a Catholic who goes to church every week , but I do not agree with such Christian arrogance . This is the worst time travel movie I have ever seen and I 've seen Timeline .  
  Quirky , independent , theatrical , Christian Slater-these are all teasers that made me look forward to spending an hour or so " discovering " a jewel of a film . Boy , was I disappointed . Julian Po never gets over itself . The film is relentlessly self-conscious . I found myself unable to suspend disbelief for even a moment . The overdone , obviously theatrical sets , the overdone , obviously theatrical acting , the overdone , obviously theatrical directing - well , you get the idea . Allegories do not need to be delivered sledge hammer style . And it 's hard to feel much of anything for Julian Po because we never know much about him . The ridiculous girlfriend , the annoying townsfolk , the idiotic clergyman , the bratty kids - why would anyone , particularly anyone with a life long ambition to get to the seaside ( Slater 's character ) , decide to stay in such a dismal place ?  
  This documentary ( or I should say mockumentary ) is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be , when they have full enthusiasm on something like that . Honestly , I hate Cryptozoology . It is unscience , it just destroy it . However , something positive in this was the visual effects ( dragons were beautiful ) , but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake , and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists , so that is the reason why it deserves a 1 of 10 and not a 0 . An example of false information would be the hydrogen idea : It is true that , according to Chemystry , the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions , so in that case , you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach . There are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly , and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing , so it is impossible . Anyway , there is actually something worse , the idea of the platinum : This element is more difficult to find than gold , and I cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that . It is ridiculous , they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet Earth , but off course at least that explain why they got extincted . Probably cryptologist 's call themselves scientists , but they are not . People like them say lies like in this mockumentary , and what is worst , some people buy them . But I do not think that a person who cares about Science would believe in dragons after watching this . Those fake scientists waste their time .  
  You want to see the movie " THE Gamers " by Dead Gentlemen Productions . This is not that movie . This movie is not funny . It is a waste of time . All of the good comments here seem to be written by ( poorly disguised ) false third parties . The people who made this movie seem to be attempting to synthesize fake interest . This movie is not a well done mockumentary . Comparisons to " Spinal Tap " or Christopher Guest are insulting . The movie is so mean-spirited that I cannot imagine anyone familiar with the subject matter finding it funny . Being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality , but if you are the ones being lampooned in this manner , you 'd have to hate yourself to enjoy it . The movie is not offensive because of its grand satire of taboo topics but because of its constant pathetic banality .  
  I missed the beginning of this film , which might account for why I disliked it so much . On the other hand I 've studied the fall of the Roman republic for years so I know the story . Then again , that might also be the reason why I disliked this film . The film has more historical inaccuracies than extras . Though it 's so inaccurate that I don't think they made an attempt for it to be correct , in which case it can be forgiven . The odd thing is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate that it ends up getting confusing . Like throwing in Antonius ' marriage to Octavia , and then pushing it aside two scenes later . Why even bring it up if it serves no purpose for the plot and Octavia is never even seen ? And like calling Antonius by his actual name ( Marcus Antonius ) in some scenes , and by his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes . Though historical inaccuracies aside , the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it wasn't for the leading lady . There isn't an ounce of dignity in her . She 's hysterical , dramatical , and completely lacking control of herself . Instead of being a clever and composed queen Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of PMS . 95 % of that comes from the poor acting , but 5 % is also from poor script writing . Far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written into the script . Sometimes you weren't watching Antonius and Cleopatra , you were watching immature versions of Dawson and Joey from " Dawson 's Creek " . If you want to watch something about this period , watch .. anything but this .  
  Should have been titled ' Balderdash ! ' Little in the film is true except the name of the island and the fact submarines were involved . Little more than training film quality with poor camera work , muddy stock footage and perhaps the low point of stereotyping ' Japs ' with laughing Japanese infantry , laughing Japanese fighter pilots and one-dimensional square-jawed Americans dying left and right . Sixty years later it is unintentionally funny as an odd artifact and as an opportunity to see what is possible when the war fever is upon you . The plot and the dialogue remind me of playing guns on a summer 's afternoon in my childhood , peering through the neighbor 's hedge to gain a fatal advantage on my best friend Steve and my little brother . In actual fact , the Makin Island raid was a near total failure with Carlson and his men wandering around in the dark exchanging gunfire with shadows until finally , thirsty and completely disoriented , looking for someone to surrender to , before they happened upon some equally confused Japanese soldiers who promptly surrendered to them ! In the withdrawal several of Carlson 's Marines ended up on another island and were abandoned ! The film , of course , couldn't tell that story , not in 1943 , so this bit of whimsy was fabricated and rushed into release to the beating of drums . With Randolph Scott , and his jaw , as Colonel Thorwald ( Carlson ) leading a unit comprised almost entirely of stock caricatures , the green recruit ( Harry Landon , Robert Mitchum ) , the grizzled veteran ( J . Carroll Naish , Milburn Stone , Sam Levene ) , the country-bumpkin ( Rod Cameron ) , the all-American boy ( Alan Curtis ) , and scores of sneering ( when they weren't laughing ) ' Japs ' . And yet the cast nearly overcomes the material . Almost . Randolph Scott 's narrow range is well suited to his role of earnest commander and he is supported by a solid group of professionals who do their best with thin gruel . But in the end , the one-note object of the exercise wins . Any pretense is totally abandoned at the close when Randy Scott simply looks directly into the camera and delivers a stirring ( well sorta stirring ) call to arms . The cast was better than this material . So was the audience . Should be viewed with Reefer Madness and a bottle of moderately priced Merlot .  
  After watching about half of this movie I noticed something peculiar .. I found myself constantly switching through tv-channels to see what else is on - not exactly a good movie trait . This movie is listed as being in a number of genres , and I must say it mostly failed misserably in every one of them . 80 % through the movie I switched over to watch an old rerun instead . Bottom line - the whole movie felt as if the ones making it didn't exactly know what to make and ended up in a concoction with no discernable taste .  
  This movie sucked plain and simple . Okay so it 's basically about a girl that gets raped , and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist . The rapist is a douche , but the girl victim is partly to blame . I mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff , but when the rapist tries to have sex with her , she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her . And the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything , but when it comes to the rapist getting raped , it 's a pretty long rape scene . There is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching . 3.2/10  
  Yeti : Curse of the Snow Demon starts aboard a plane full of American high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in Japan , unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the Himalayas . Unlucky really . With some dead & some alive the survivors have to think about themselves & decide to wait it out until help comes . However just when they think their luck couldn't get any worse they soon discover that a huge , hairy Yeti type Abominable Snowman creature wants to kill & eat them all . Trapped , cold , starving & fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time ? Yeah , with a title like Yeti : Curse of the Snow Demon it can only mean one thing & that is that someone at the Sci-Fi Channel has made yet another ' Creature Feature ' although to give these things a bit of variety the Sci-Fi Channel here in the UK are now dubbing them as a ' Beast Feast ' ! As if that will make any difference . Directed by Paul Ziller one has to say that Yeti : Curse of the Snow Deamon is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time , sure it 's bad but it 's sort of fun at times too . The basic premise is alright actually , it 's a sort of cross between Alive ( 1993 ) with it 's plane crash & the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive & the excellent gory killer Bigfoot ( another legendary hairy monster ) exploitation flick Night of the Demon ( 1980 ) which I would defend with my last breath & I have to say it 's not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as I said it 's fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written . The character 's are mostly annoying American teens , there 's the expected arguing , there 's the macho hero , the strong female & the coward who thinks only of himself so there 's no prizes for originality . There are some plot holes too , if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them ? How are you going to dig a large hole & line it with sharpened sticks in the space of ten minutes ? Why did the Yeti not kill that bird at the end ? It had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her ? The ' there are actually two Yeti 's running around ' twist isn't used to any effect at all either . At least there 's a good pace about the film , it certainly moves along at a fair old pace & I never found myself becoming bored with it . There 's some moderately gory action & the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not & if they are going to eat their dead mates or not . The one thing you can always say about these Sci-Fi Channel ' Creature Features ' or ' Beast Feasts ' is that the CGI computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious & so that proves to be the case yet again . The plane crash at the start looks awful & the Yeti when it 's CGI looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it 's on a pogo stick . There one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm , a squashed head , a ripped out heart , some dead bodies , some blood splatter & the best bit when the Yeti rips a guy in half & beats him with his own ripped-off legs before biting a big chunk out of them . According to the IMDb the actor playing the Yeti took three & a half hours to get into the suit & the make-up which seems like a long time since it 's actually a pretty tatty looking creation . Apparently the original title was Raksha : Curse of the Snow Demon with Raksha meaning demon in Tibetan Sanskrit , so now you know . This has reasonable production values considering the usual Sci-Fi Channel stuff they churn out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh , bleak Himalayas & was probably situated near some ski resort somewhere & during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm . The acting isn't that good & I didn't think any of the girls looked that good either which didn't help . Yeti : Curse of the Snow Demon is another terrible Sc-Fi Channel ' Creature Feature ' if I am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this isn't too bad & there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it 's not very good .  
  Towards the end of the movie , I felt it was too technical . I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy performs rescues at sea . I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers . I guess I should have figured that out before , but I never thought about it . Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic . The acting was pretty good , since they 're mostly seasoned professionals , but if you 're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen , it should be more like a fantasy , comical , etc . Everything was taken too seriously . At least the movie had Felix Ungar as pilot , with Buck Rogers , the night stalker , and Dracula also on board . The movie was filled with well known faces . I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama , but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature . That 's why I said it should have been more comical . My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about . They walk around with drinks , setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later , just as if they 're in a building or something , and acting as if turbulence just doesn't exist . Also , I know it 's a disaster movie , but suspense doesn't have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something . Anyway , the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after it 's first screening . I like Lee Grant , but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked .. : )
