  # - # - # - [ Why this rating ? ] - # - # - # Some 2 years ago , when I bought my HV20 , I did a lot of research on tapes , and the consensus overwhelmingly pointed to the Panasonic AMQ family . So far , with over 50 tapes used , I am a happy camper indeed - no dropouts , and great quality . I am a true believer now , and hence the 5-star " I Love It ! " rating . # - # - # - [ Tape Types ] - # - # - # Irrespective of the tape you decide to use , I learned that it was more important to be loyal to the type of lubricant used - referred to by my friends as wet or dry tapes . The Panasonic belongs to the dry type family , whereas Sony tapes use a wet lubricant . For instance , Panasonic claims that this tape uses a " .. dry type lubricant [ that ] causes less video head wear ( - 4m after 500H ) . It also prevents head clogs and extends head life . " While some on the ' net argue that this distinction is an urban myth - I decided to trust my professional friends on this issue . This difference is not material until you switch between the two types - which can lead to clogged video heads . # - # - # - [ Archival ] - # - # - # I rely very heavily on tape as an archival mechanism for all my HD masters . Hence my decision to go with the AMQ series over the PQ series ( which are a bit cheaper ) . Happy Recording ! - Damodar  
  I bought this backpack for travel / vacation purposes . It worked out great ; the bag is not too small , and not too big . I was suprised how many lens and accessories I could jam in here . I put my Rebel XT w / Tamron 28-75mm lens . I also put 3 additional lens in the bag : Canon 28-135 IS , 17-55mm , and a 50mm . Oh , and a 430 flash ! That was all fitted in the bottom section only . You still have plenty of room up top , for accessories , CF card , lens cleaning kit , etc . Also , it came in handy as a shopping bag ! Of course , I didn't carry all lenses with me at all times , just the ones I was gonna use that day . The bag is very comfortable to wear , due to the fact that the shoulder pads were made of gel . All in all , it was a very balance backback , that was versatile , and looks great too . The only negative thing I have to say about this backpack , is that , if you want to get to your camera in an instant , forget it . You have to take of the bag , set it down somewhere , then unclip and unzipper it before you can get you camera out . Then again , your camera is very safe in here , and if you want fast access , get a sling backpack , or wear the camera around you neck !  
  I purchased this so I could have power for my GPS on my snowmobile . If you don't have a cigarette plug on yours , go to your local electronics store and get yourself a bridge rectifier , cut the plug off of this and connect to the rectifier , tap into 12 VAC and ground on the sled for the other 2 connectors on the rectifier and you 've got power . You do still need batteries because the voltage gets weak at idle , but there is plenty off idle . Get the bicycle mount for GPS to mount on handlebars . Been using this setup for a few years . Works great and is a smart idea in unfamiliar territory .  
  I have 4 of these now . They take up less room than keeping all the cases for the movies , games , and music . The website to organize all your items is user friendly and you can print your list many different ways .  
  Pretty much used as an extension plug , but needed it for more outlets . Actually did have a power failure recently and all was fine , no blown fuses or anything . Not using the coaxial component so can't comment on that , but product is great and works just fine !  
  I got these figuring they would make my ethernet cables I made look more professional and protect the connectors . They actually don't stay on the connectors and float down the wire from the connector . If you manage to get one to stay on the connector it will squeeze it 's tab and make it fall out of the device it 's plugged into . Absolutely worthless .  
  .. which isn't really saying much , when you consider how pathetic the five hundred dollar Bose Wave radio is . People , it 's not rocket science : if you want quality sound you , miniaturizing and cramming together all your components into one tiny little box is NEVER going to do the trick-don't fall for all the advertising snake oil about " revolutionary technology , " " virtual surround sound , " etc . At the very least a compact stereo system like the one hundred eighty dollar Sony CMTHPX9 has * detachable * speakers so you can get proper stereo separation and proper speaker placement . Or the Sony MHC-GX450 for an extra twenty dollars has a detachable subwoofer as well , not the ludicrous what , 3-inch subwoofer this Cambridge radio has ? Either of these would blow this thing clear out of the water ! Even better would be to browse jandr . com for something like a cheap receiver ( Sherwood 7108 , $ 130 ) , cheap CD / DVD player ( Toshiba 3960 , $ 50 ) , and speakers ( Polk R15s , $ 100 / pair ) which would still cost less and would easily deliver five times better sound . Ah , form factor-yes that 's about the only thing that this Cambridge and that Bose Wave has going for it : I suppose if you live in a tiny five by ten foot closet ( a NYC apartment perhaps ? ) it might be useful to have something this small . Otherwise you are much better buying one of those compact stereos and a cheap clock radio for your bedside , which would probably cost you about half as much for far better sound quality !  
  IMO , U2 is the best Flash players around . What I like the most in my player ? -> Excellent sound quality ( default earbuds that come with the players don't match well with the player though - replace ' em with iPod 's and you will love it ! ) > Compact size > Line-in and Voice recording > FM Radio + recordingThe only thing I miss in the player is AM radio as I listen to Bloomberg radio every morning .  
  Like many others , when my Rio Karma died and replacements were not available , I ended up shopping around and getting this player . Overall , I am very pleased with the device . It looks great , is easy to use overall , sounds great , and the pictures add to the cool factor . My only two complaints about the device itself would be that you cannot delete tracks directly from the player ( you have to use software through your PC ) and that scrolling through music only displays title information ( not artist / album , like on the Karma ) . Neither of those are deal killers , but I do miss the features . My main gripes are with the software support and documentation . The documentation is weak to start with , and not translated well into English . Some of it is indecipherable . Read it through once to get necessary tidbits , then put it aside and play with the device to figure the rest out . As for the software support , I don't like the fact that they bundled it with Napster Lite rather than either something proprietary ( that worked better ) or better integration with Windows Media Player 10 ( WMP10 ) . It is fairly well supported through WMP10 , but it 's not comprehensive . For example , it synchronizes the software well but doesn't copy or synchronize playlists - you 'll need the Napster software for that ( argh ! ) . I did have one little problem . When I first loaded my library to the device ( about 1200 songs ) , many of them ( about 25 % ? ) didn't load with the right genre . That is , the genre in the ID3 tag might be " Reggae " but the device would display it as " ( 16 ) . " Some would load fine , others wouldn't . This was a problem with both Napster and WMP10 , so I don't think it was the player directly . I tried re-entering the genre through WMP10 , but it still didn't work . When I used Moosic Organizer to re-write the tags , it worked ! I simply re-synced the player with WMP10 after re-entering the tag info and they all loaded just fine . The photo album is cute , but not terribly useful . The display is large , by mobile device standards , but still small compared to your monitor , or paper pictures . Still , it 's fun to have some pictures on the device to share and the display is very good , despite the size . The device works great as an external hard drive to your PC . You need a special cable to connect the device to a PC ( it 's not a normal USB cable on the device end ) , but it functions very well and allows you to use that storage for something other than pictures and music . Finally , the USB host feature should be very handy for people who have compatible cameras . I haven't gotten my favorite digital camera ( a Sony ) to work yet , but others seem just fine . I 'm sure more support with come down the road . Overall , a great little device with some nice features . Use WMP10 instead of Napster and you 'll be happier . I just hope it holds up better than my Rio Karma did !  
  To begin with I 'm not a techie and I don't know a tweeter from a woofer . I just wanted to copy my CD collection ( and possibly my cassettes ) so I could listen to them anytime , anywhere . I researched all the choices and read everyone 's reviews and decided on the iRiver IHP-40 primarily because of its memory size and comments made by manufacturers that they don't think people are interested in large memory capacity ( worried they 'd stop making this size ) . The first thing to do when your iRiver arrives is to find the hold button on both devices and change its position . It is shipped with the hold " on " which may explain why some people couldn't get it to work from the get go . You should also go to the main menu and under display change backlighting battery and adapter . They 're set for 3 seconds and you can't navigate fast enough before it turns off . The data management system shipped on the disc only works if you 're going to use MP3 files . Its useless if you 're going to copy WMA files . But that 's OK , I 'm using a computer with Windows XP and you don't need the disc at all and the data management system already on the IHP-40 works just great . But if you are going to use MP3 's and installed the disc you have to go into the main menu and under ' general ' turn on the DB scan in order to use it . Another thing to know is that a friend tried reformatting per page 3 and the IHP-40 is too large to format using FAT32 ( at least with Windows 2000 and Windows XP ) so don't go down that road . You can get help online . You may have to wait , but they will answer your question . The phone number they give connects to a machine that takes your name and number and someone will call you in two days . It isn't THAT difficult to navigate , after a few minutes you start getting used to it . The case is brown and ugly . I use a generic CD waist belt holder when I 'm listening . That way its ' secure and doesn't advertise the fact that I have something expensive to steal . I really wish it could record from the radio , but that 's my only complaint . I 've copied 172 CDs so far ( classical and jazz ) and haven't had any problems downloading additions everyday . Have more CDs to copy . I 've also copied a radio program recorded by my Crane recorder ( its like a radio VCR ) directly from the Crane to the IHP-40 . Only complaint is you can only record in MP3 or WAV format and I 'm trying to conserve space and use WMA files as much as possible . Had concerns about the life of the battery ( a lot of money if it isn't going to last forever ) , but there are places online that sell replacement batteries and instructions for most all of the hard drive jukeboxes . I wouldn't have purchased any of them if I couldn't replace the battery , just too much money for throw away technology . So far I 'm very pleased with the iRiver-IHP0-40 . No more messing with CD cases , CDs in a different location from where I am when I want to listen , changing CDs or being connected to a large disc changer ( listen with earphones ) when I have to move around . I would recommend buying this if a friend asked me . I 'd suggest reading all the reviews , because you learn alot about how to work the machine before it arrives . Would give it 5 stars , but that 's perfection . Think it should be rated 4 1/2 stars ( because of not being able to record from the radio ) .  
  Delivery was prompt and everythings appears to work properly . Haven't managed to geet all my shows recorded on schedule yet , but that is not a problem of the device .  
  Very well made and looks like it will hold up for a very long time ! I 'm not a professional photographer , far from it , but I don't think you can go wrong with this if you have a DSLR without a huge telephoto lens to support . I have an Olympus E-500 system and it 's great with this !  
  The unit was delivered promptly . This mount works well and was easy to install .  
  This camera sounds good in specs , but the pictures are what you 'd expect from an inexpensive digital camera . The colors are washed out , and the images are poor quality . Spend a little more money and get a betterr camera .  
  It seems to me that all headphones die within 1 year , so why get expensive ones . I have gone through about 5 pairs of these so far , they last me on average 6 months before one ear bud loses function . To me , these are the best value I could find .  
  This projector worked well enough connected to a home theater system , but not good enough on it 's own . Speaker sounds awful , and the DVD player is so-so . However , after owning one for just over 2 years , I made the mistake of unplugging it to dust the table it was placed on , and when I plugged it back in , the Lamp and Temp LED 's began to flash and the unit won't power on . There were no symptoms leading up to this , we used it not 12 hours earlier with no indications of any issues . I called Optoma tech support , and they didn't even want to hear the problem , they wanted me to ship it to them for repair . I checked online sources , and the symptoms seem to indicate the Temperature Control Sensor has failed , and of course , you can't find the part anywhere to replace it yourself . Imagine that , a two-year-old electronic device that fails when you plug it back in . Absolutely disposable , I will never buy another Optoma product .  
  this is a good product . It easily picked up the local TV stations ' signal . I can't say it is the best product but for the price I paid , I am happy with it .  
  The HP Color LaserJet 3600n is a good buy for the money . You get laser color , speed ( 17 ppm ) , networking . 2 trays all in one machine . If you want great color , don't buy a laser machine , get an inkjet instead . But if you want good color documents printed in a speedy manner for less cost than an inkjet , buy this printer . One of the real benefits of this printer is that it comes with 4 FULL toner cartridges which would normally cost over $ 500 for the cartidges alone ! The toner cartridges are all exposed when you open the cover , making installation very simple . Jams are extremely easy to remove when you have such wide access . By buying this printer , you are getting a lot of bang for your buck !  
  I was happy to see the ithe as soon as I did ; Quality merchandise at a great buy , fast shipping , excellant buy .  
  Don't believe the picture ! This does NOT come in a Brother retail box , and the cartridges don't even have the Brother brand name on it . Looks like third-party ink , NOT BROTHER . Will be returning my order ! :(  
  This is an amazing speaker set , which to me , has great sound quality and looks for a PC speaker system . Minor Snag-The tiny speaker connectors have a triangular socket / key shape just near the metal pin . So if not aligned well the connect doesnt go in completely . So it is required to push the connectors well and deep , with a bit of twist . Secondly , the stereo input connector from PC does not need the full push ( at least in my set . ) This connector needs to be pulled out a bit . This fixes the no-sound in right speaker issue which few users have faced . ( its actually no-sound or very low sound in right one . ) Looks like they missed the finer details of those connectors . Since the right one is also a volume control speaker , I think they put the key on connectors , in case the user misses the color codes . but now the slotted keys alignment . Otherwise great sounding and looking speakers , for that price . And those soft touch keys to control volume still impress anyone who sees them first time . 5/5 !  
  I got this router and just after a year it started to become very unstable . It would loose even wired connection very easily . We need to reset it every few minutes . It becomes totally unusable . I tried to contact Netgear technical support and found that the only support that you don't need to pay is an email support . I sent an email then it takes another day or two before getting a reply . It really doesn't work . Along the way , they want me to upgrade the firmware . After I upgrade the firmware following the instruction on their website , the router stops functioning completely . They refused to do anything because " it is no longer convered under warranty " . I had 3 other pieces of Netgear products besides the dead router . It looks like they are not going to last long . I would never buy another Netgear product ever again . And you shouldn't either . The only positive I can say is that it looks a lot prettier than the LinkSys I have now . But who really cares what it looks like . I want good electronic inside not good looking plastic outside . When it breaks , you cannot even get help .  
  This is the first " Real Quality " subwoofer I 've owned . It replaces a Bose unit which I bought on sale some years back . All I can say is WoW ! Any cheap sub will crack the windows if turned up high enough . But if you want something with a smooth tight bass that augments your music and seems to disapear , then this is one of them . Of any piece of audio equipment , a subwoofer is in actualality a " musical instrument " . Speakers , in general , are made to reproduce the full audio spectrum which are made up of multiple instruments . But a subwoofer is dedicated to the lower seqment ( somewhere from about 120Hz and lower ) . The Mirage OMNIS8 does this with class . And if called upon , it will rock the foundation with the opening scene from " Star Wars " .  
  I read a lot of amazon reviews before purchasing this microphone , but I should have paid more attention to the troubles specific to Windows 7 64-bit . When I plugged it in it was recognized immediately , but when I try recording on sound recorder I get such a faint sound on playback you can hardly tell it 's supposed to be a voice recording . I also tried using it with Snap 5 screenshot recording with video , and the sound playback is still barely audible . If I speak loudly and hold the microphone very close to my mouth , the playback is still very muffled and you mostly hear puffs of breath . That 's the best I could get it with the troubleshooting I was able to do . Logitech 's support site has no help at all for Windows 7 ; it stops at Vista . I 'm very disappointed .  
  This came with a new pc I bought a couple of years ago . Since I didn't need the printer at the time I left it in the box . When I needed to replace an older printer that stopped working I pulled this out and put it to use . It worked for one month before I got an error message that I need to take out and check the color cartridge . i replaced it with a new one and still get the same message . Called Hp and of course the warranty is up and it 'd be cheaper for me to purchase a new one .  
  We use this to provide wi-fi in our home to our PC laptop , two iPhones , and our iPad and to network everything back to our PC desktop . Works great . For the price you can't go wrong .  
  I returned this item along with the dashboard mount . I received credit for the dashboard mount but I did not receive credit for this item . Please advise . Thanks , Carl Meeks  
  I compared many 32 LCD TV 's and the Panasonic LX600 has the best picture quality . I compared LG , Sharp , and Samsung and the Panasonic has the best color and angle viewing . It 's a little more expensive than some other 32 inch models but for the price you get a better product . Only disapointment is that Panasonic doesn't offer a 37 in model . This unit has 3000:1 contrast ratio , 8ms refresh , and 500 brightness . The stand allows for the tv to be moved side to side which is a nice feature . The speakers are on the bottom so the tv fits in tight place where some 32 lcds have the speakers on the side which increases the size of the tv . If there is any complaint , its that the remote feel cheap . Not bad , but just kind of inexpensive . Overall , I would recommend this TV to anyone looking for a 32inch LCD .  
  Live TVPeople mention the problems with the TIVO not being designed to turn off . For my purposes though the problem is that the recording of Live TV can not be turned off . This records up to 30 minutes of whatever channel is on . This happens 24hours a day . I tested the electricity use and it is 25 watts ( kilo ? ) . At night the only thing that can compete with this is our fridge or humidifier but they are doing something useful . It is probably much larger than the sum of all the little things you have going on in the house ( phones charging , clocks , all the glowing LED 's .. ) . Plus there is the wear on hard drive and the noise . RecommendationsI never found the recommendations useful . They seem mostly genre based . For example , if you like the Office then you must like other sitcoms so you get Will and Grace and Scrubs . If you like lost then you 'll like any show with islands or aliens . For our watching it didn't turn out this way . We like Lost and the Office because ( in our opinion ) they 're good not because they are in a genre . TIVO doesn't seem to be able to match us up with other people that have an overall similar taste . The good stuffIt 's very easy to use . It runs itself . There are a staple of shows and a wishlist or two which keep it so there is always something to watch .  
  Even though the Spec 's posted by Amazon states it works with Windown 98 be aware that Linksys Ver . 4 will only work with Windows 98SE and above ( Per Linksys Tech Support ) . Linksys Ver . 2.6 and earler work with Windows 98 1st edition ( 4.10 ) and above . Amazon is only shipping WUSB11 's with Version 4.0This device also will not work with Tivo series 2 .  
  This was the very first mp3 player I ever bought and I loved it . I only used it for cardio and loved it ! GOOD1 . Durable Design2 . Make Playlists3 . Easy to load songs4 . Takes AA batteries ( don't have to recharge ) 5 . Armband ( I strapped it to my arm or to the cardio equipment if I was indoors-great ! ) 6 . FM Radio with PresetsBAD1 . Low Memory ( If you 're only looking to put about 50 + / - songs than it 's great ; I only bought a new mp3 because I needed more songs ) 2 . A little heavy ( Now I 'm just being a little picky-if you put it on your arm it might be annoying , but it wasen't that big of a deal ) 3 . Black & White Screen ( This didn't bother me , as long as it worked , I didn't care ) Overall I LOVED this mp3 . If Rio would have made one in the same design but at least 1GB + , I would gave bought it in a heart beat . I bought the iRiver instead ; it 's good , but you can't make playlists and I really miss that feature !  
  I think it 's more than said , that this is the best complete mp3 player with most compatible options there is in the market , its worth every buck !  
  This is a great device the software to use it sucks . The software in the zune is great but the software you install on your computer is terrible . Which makes me wonder why create a bad software when you all ready have a good one . Instead of using Windows music player and make a simple patch to make it work for the Zune they created a frustrating and hard software to use . I recommend the zune to tech savvy people only if you don't know how to do much on a computer you will have trouble  
  nice comfy , wireless keyboard n mouse . easy to use . it was nice deal for the price !  
  Garmin Vehicle Power Cable for n & uuml ; vi Portable GPS Navigators ( 010-10723-06 ) I returned this item since the GPS unit came with one . This should have been noted in the description of the GPS itself .  
  we saw this product on telly and had to give it a go given our numerous applications . we noticed our electricity bill reduce quite noticably . we love it and highly recommend this great product . I am surprised that no major retailers are selling this product ! we have been using this product for over a year now .. along with with our energy saving light bulbs .  
  This remote works perfectly out of the box and is very easy to program for the TV set . I replaced a worn out remote , so it is great to have every option work on the first push now .  
  Arrived on time . Seems like the projector bulbs are what I ordered and they are in good condition . Excllant transaction . I won't know for sure until I actually use the bulbs .  
  The Yamaha RX-497 AM / FM Stereo Receiver is an elegant piece of electronics . It produces high fidelity sound with lots of power . The front panel is intuitive and easy to use . The FM antenna is better than some add-on antennas I 'd purchased previously . In addition to the radio , I count seven auxiliary inputs on the back ( including XM radio ) and two sets of speaker jacks so the amplifier has lots of flexibility . Remember to check the dimensions , the receiver is big .  
  I own a few different MP3 players and finally decide on the Zune because of the Microsoft name and the 30GB capacity , also because i have friends who swear by their Ipod 's but I found them lacking to some degree . The Zune music service is great , loading music is fast , and video playback is stellar . Overall in my opinion an excellent product .  
  I got these to replace my 4 yr old Senn px 100 which suddenly got broken at the miniplug , these are not as comfortable as the Px 100 but they do sound great and give you more bass because they are tighter against your ears but with an offer from another site which ended costing me just $ 5.00 i could not pass them up . They 're also very sensitive which makes them ideal for Ipods and other portable devices .  
  These are the most comfortable , and fragile , headphones I 've ever owned . The design is unique . The sound is well above average , decent lows and mids , treble is a little muddy . It 's true what everyone says . The tension that keeps these headphones on your ears and off your neck comrs from a thin piece of clear , easily breakable plastic , so don't get them if you can't treat them carefully or have a big head . For me , they rest on a hook above the ground . The cable is relatively short , so they are better for mp3 players , music phones , headphone cable extenders , or bluetooth remote audio gateways ( which is what I use it mainly for ) . Definitely worth the $ 15 I paid for them .  
  What better way to organize the digital photographs you have burned to CD ? I run thumbnails on 5x8 index cards and put them in the front of the sleeve in which each CD is stored . Just listing the filenames takes less space . Now I can find particular subjects or photos without having to slip each CD into the drive or writing all over the CD itself . I also like it for it 's original intent .. to store DVDs compactly . What 's in each album ? I use a commercial labeler ( i.e. P-Touch ) which sticks just fine and helps me organize the various albums .  
  Purchased as a gift for my son . Best headphones ever . Can turn off the base boost if needed to reduce power drain .  
  Doing business with this company was a pleasure . My ipod came promptly and was in great shape . Super quality , customer service , and product . I highly recommend purchasing ipods from this seller !  
  Nice armband . Doesn't slide down your arm . I 'm very petite with small arms and this JUST makes it for me . You will sweat under the armband but that 's to be expected . Holds the iPod perfectly , and you can still press the buttons through the mesh front .  
  A reasonable price and pretty good free shipping .. even to Hawai'i . Much better than the I-pod and will integrate well into future firmware Microsoft updates . It 's the ease of use that will make you smile . The video and audio are very good . How am I ever going to fill it with my favorite audio and video ? I don't think I can , but it will be fun trip to take .  
  I 've owned this for a month now and I 'm thrilled . This power supply is outstanding for what I use it for ( R / C Hobbies ) . Maybe a bit of overkill until I get into charging larger battery packs . It 's a bit hefty ( 23 pounds ) for transport to and from a track , but it handles everything I throw at it and stays cool without a lot of noise . It accepts the banana plugs from my charger so I don't have to mess with wrapping bare wire . Keep in mind if you need to supply something less than 12V , you may want to go with it 's little brother the PS26KX which still provides 22-25 AMPs and adjusts from 6-15V . Overall , I highly recommend this power supply over smaller ( < 20AMP ) systems that many R / C stores try to push on people . I little bit more money will save a lot of headaches .  
  When my original WRT54G router final gave up the ghost after almost 5 years of continous service ( telecomuting from my home office by day , internet surfing by night ) , I purchased a Linksys WRT120N wireless router locally because I needed to get back " on the air " quickly , What a total piece of crap the WRT120N turned out to be , I wish I had found and read the review at [ .. ] before wasting my money on itOk , so what does this have to do with a review of a Linksys WRT54L router ? Well , I want to also pass on a warning about the WRT120N and say why I ended up replacing it with a WRT54L.The WRT120N is a 802.11n router billed as being backwards with 802.11g but it is not ! It is very unreliable and after finding myself needing to constantly do a power off / on reset due to it sporadically " locking " up I decided it was high time to give it the boot after a few weeks of that nonsense and go back to a WRT54 series wireless router . The WRT54L couldn't arrive soon enough to replace the WRT12N and much to my pleasant surprise it showed up days ahead of the timeframe Amazon gave for the Super Saver shipping . The WRT54L is a tried and true WRT54 series router that uses Linux firmware instead of Cisco 's firmware . That opens up a whole new world in being able to tweak the router 's performance by installing a 3 party firmware such as DD-WRT , if desired . For me , that was not necessary as it provides a strong enough wifi signal to be able to connect from any area of my multi level home . But I sure like having that option available even if it 's not needed at this time , Installation was a breeze and a much improved process than what I went through with my original WRT54G router . Bottom line .. BUY THIS ROUTER if you are lookng for your first router or a replacement , you will not be disappointed .  
  Microphone is better than average , volume and balance of audio quality is good for the money . Comfortable for longer use . I 'd recommend it .  
  It took me a while to understand this card was the source of my computer freezing every few seconds , but noticing that Metatrader 4 sounded a disconnect alarm during the freeze-up made it obvious . Repairing my wireless connection would get rid of it for a variable amount of time , but it always returned . I tried everything Trendnet suggested , I even reinstalled Windows XP , ( which gave me a nice clean fast new installation free of all the junk I had accumulated ! ) but nothing helped . I 'm buying a new card , probably the Super G 802.11BG Wireless Pci 64 Bit Xp Compliant Turbo Mode by MSI , since it has the best reviews .  
  What a great camera in such a small package . I do recommend to use with 400 film , I just have not felt comfortable using 800 film on it .  
  I bought this unit several months back for my office . Its clock light is hard see unless the office light is office .. which makes it a bit hard to work . The tuner is analog and to small scale to be able to get any one station easily . I have not tried the CD player yet . I happened to see this unit on Amazon while looking for its replacement and decided to rate it . Very disappointing for a Sony product .  
  Able to collapse , not VERY small but certainly moderately easy to carry onboard . Sound quality good , not much noise leakage ( someone sitting * right * next to you might know you 're listening to something ) . Ear cushioning soft , comfortable to wear ( much better than the cheap earbuds that came with my Rio ) . Music quality good .. at least , quite good for using for travel , and helps keep noise out too .  
  If you are looking for a convienant way to organize your Music , Movies and Pictures the 80 gigabyte iPod is a must have . It has enough memory to hold all the songs you will need to complete your personal soundtrack as you go through out your day . And during those down times when you need something else to watch rather than your own life , you can select from a variety of movies that you can load and unload from your iPod . And when you are stuck with a stranger and have nothing to talk about , your picture library can help you brag how cool your life is and helps explain how popular you have become . It is slim and small so it can fit in your pocket without a bulge and it is light so it isn't a burden to carry it around . I have had my iPod for a few months now and love it !  
  The cover over the spindle was busted and several of the CD 's were broken . Very disappointed because the box they were shipped in was fine so they must have been packed that way .  
  Absolutely terrible tech support , comes with zero usuable maps , took me 6 hours and 4 attempts with tech support to download maps . May have been my computer Microsoft Vista , but still 6 hours .  
  I 'm on my second Sennheiser headset and I didn't even bother looking at other headsets when I bought a replacement headset since the sound quality and comfort from this headset is outstanding . I bought the headset to use originally while playing WoW with some friends and every time the voice quality in sending and receiving was outstanding . . . which I could not say was the same with my buddy who sometimes had to fiddle with things a bit to avoid sounding muffled . I also have used this headset quite a bit to watch movies on-line , listen to music or playing PC games when I don't want to disturb my wife in the adjoining room . Again . . . sound quality is excellent . For the price I 've been quite pleased . Now as to why I am on my second set . . . my darn cat who has a rubber wire fetish chewed right through the first set 's wiring . . . which is why this second set will not be left out where she can chew on it .  
  Really amazing camera . If you are looking to buy HD type camera for your skype - this is it ! Make sure you have powerful computer and fast internet !  
  This system has been a blessing for me . I used to print CD 's one at a time and it was a real pain . As my business grew I needed more power . I recieved this two days before my daughter was born and set it up to use while I was on PAternity duty . It setup easy and ran very low maintenance . I was running it on a computer that was doing nothing but that , and technically not up to the spec they recommend . Occassionally I have to reboot the machine , but that 's the case with any windows machine . I think it approx . 18 months I have likely burned and printed about 6000 CD 's . Business is growing again and I recently bought a high speed duplicator . That machine cost me $ 1100 and will do 11 CD 's or 43 seconds for me so my bravo is just used for printing now . I strongly recommend this . It 's not perfect , but nothing with moving parts that is used alot is going to be no maintenance forever . This machine has been a stud for me ..  
  This is the second one of these I bought and I 've had no problems with either one of them . I get great picture and sound .  
  So , I did not write a review for this item before and I am glad because it 's only been two months and it 's dead already ! We have to tap it in order to get it to power our laptop and it 's always going on and off .  
  I like the tunebuds . It 's a good concept - earbuds and lanyard , all in one . Fits good , sounds good , and looks good , especially when I 'm out for a run or working out . My wife doesn't know it yet but I 'm buying another set for her .  
  I felt compelled to write a review of the Orbit Optical after reading some of the negative comments . It has been an excellent product . Very dependable for many years . As for the ball " jumping " out it hasn't happened to me in all the years I 've had this one and I have never noticed a " dead spot " during use . Regarding " no scrolling " complaints , the Kensington Mouseworks software , when installed , does have a scroll feature that is activated by " chording " the left and right buttons . I got the Orbit Optical as a warranty replacement from Kensington for an older mechanical model that wore out . Great warranty support . I do a lot of CAD and graphics work and my hand is comfortable all the time . No chasing the mouse around the desktop . I do admit I use a Fellowes mouse pad with a built in wrist rest for more comfort and it keeps the Orbit from sliding around . My wife liked mine so much she ordered one for her Mac ( now she has two buttons that work ! ) .  
  exceeds my needs , but the cost of replacing my equipment makes this purchase a minor issue . I 'll buy another . A great peace of mind investment .  
  I was searching for a tiny micro system for my office , and being a fan of Phillips products , checked their web site and found this line . I saw that the local Best Buy sold these units , so I went there for a test listen . Comparing all of the small units side-by-side there , this one really showed it 's true colors ! Smooth , silky sound ( you can't beat ribbon tweeters ! ) , easy to use , clean , compact design .. I could go on and on . Yes , I bought one ! My ONLY complaint is I cannot tune in the few radio stations that I prefer ( my office is in a commercial steel building ) , but the iPod hooked right up to it and I 'm quite satisfied !  
  Mount secures well to the bike and the new battery door attaches firmly to the garmin . Works just as it should .  
  i use these for my rear surrounds and am extremely satisfied , great bass for a small tower . worth the money  
  It works well for me . Before I bought it , I saw someone said something negative about this router . But the truth is it is compatiable with the windows vista . Easy install , stable signal . If the price can be lower a little bit , that would be best .  
  I purchased this because I wanted a digital 35 mm slr . I have an older Nikon Coolpix . The lenses from my regular slr work on this new digital model and I was thrilled with that . This camera takes great pictures and is easy to use , actually easier than the Coolpix !  
  After reading the other reviews I was concern about the scanner , however , my time and buget was limited and I had a lot of cards to input . So , I decided to give the scanner a try . I was pleasantly confirmed that I made the right choice . It does have problems recognizing hand written cards and fancy font - which is good for me to know about my own business cards , however , it 's real easy to fix when adding notes about my new business associates . Overall , I really like my scanner , I found the whole system easy to install , the program user friendly , and the set up quick to start scanning - about 5 - 10 minutes . I was able to scan 50 cards , add notes and edit recognition issues within minutes - about 15 . Hope this helps !  
  Excellent headphones . This is the 5th set of headphones I 've gone through and I 'll be sticking with these for awhile for a few reasons . First , they 're durable and made to last . The headband is padded and strong and won't snap , warp , or bend . The cups are very secure . And , most importantly , the single wire config is well protected , especially at the point of connection on the cup . Second , the sound is excellent . Very clear and crisp . I mean VERY CLEAR and CRISP . The sound really surrounds the ear because of the 50mm cups which really adds to encompassing you in the music . I used to have a problem with the bass , but then I found out that it was the source of the music that made the bass shallow ( my laptop ) . When I went to a different source ( my walkman ) I really knew what they meant by the Brainshaker Technology . These headphones are not very good at filtering out external noises , but I don't mind , in fact I prefer it that way . I like to know what 's going on around me .  
  Not the most well built tripod but it works well . As a hobbyist photographer I purchased this tripod for my Canon T2i . It holds the camera well in portrait and landscape modes . The levels are accurate and setup and breakdown are fairly simple . The drawback is the head on the tripod is made of all plastic so it doesn't feel as durable as the more expensive tripods . The tilt and portrait tilt don't hold as well as I would like but none the less it still holds . If your looking for a tripod to experiment with , this is a good start . I bought it to travel with and use at home when I need one . It will get me by till I can afford a more expensive one .  
  Fabulous digital music player ! I use Linux ( Ubuntu ) and this connects perfectly-it mounts as an external USB storage device . It also plays more than just the standard mp3 , wav and wma formats , but also supports free formats like ogg and flac . If you use Linux and want a 20 GB HDD digital music player I recommend this one highly !  
  I 'm a bit perplexed at another review that stated the microphone does not work with Windows XP ( Service Pack 2 ) ; in fact , it almost prevented me from purchasing . Nevertheless , I took a chance , and I 'm glad I did . All I had to do was plug the jack in , and I was off and running . Sound quality is best at about 6 inches away , although tone is muted a bit . I was very impressed , however , at the complete absence of background noise - despite the fact that my washer and dryer were both running , and my wife and kids were talking and watching television only a few feet away . For my weekly podcast , this is the perfect choice . Interweb research shows the next best microphone to be in the $ 60-$80 price range so the $ 20 price makes the Logitech USB Desktop Microphone a no-brainer . As for that Service Pack 2 issue , it 's possible that the difficulty was the result of another problem ( such as a conflict ) , or it 's possible an update has rendered the problem obsolete . In any case , mine worked right out of the box . Highly recommended .  
  If you find one in good shape - BUY IT ! I bought one locally off Craigslist very cheap , with intention to listen to SACD . I was extremely impressed of sound quality and soon after , I bought a second H / K DVD48 off eBay .. I never found one here .. This is the best SACD played for on budget listeners , without compromising sound quality !  
  I 've been a trackball user for over 5 years now . The last one I had was Kensington 's one with the big clear blue ball . It lasted a good 4 years before the lil rubber rollers gave out . So I decided to replace it with an optical trackball . I chose this one because it had the same layout and left / right click capabilities as my previous one . I am pretty pleased with it . I am amazed at how little I have to work to move the ball .. I never realized how much effort I needed to move the old non-optical one . There are only a few design issues I wish I could fix . 1 ) My old one you could turn the whole thing upside down and the ball wouldn't fall out . On this model the ball has no locking-in device . I use this with my laptop and have to search for the ball at the bottom of my bag every single time . 2 ) The lil indent the optical lense is sitting in is a prime place for dust and crap to settle , disrupting the performance . They should cover it up and make it flush with the rest of the interior . 3 ) I wish the buttons were moved a lil more towards the front . It 's the fine for clicking with your thumb .. but a lil too far back to click on the otherside with your pinky or ring finger .  
  My wife and I bought ourselves a CellSocket for a Holiday Gift . It 's enabled us to unplug Ma Bell and lower our phone bill in half by using those airtime minutes and low-cost long distance calls from the phones in the house . The unit works with my T-Mobile ( used to be VoiceStream ) Nokia 6190 ( and quite a few other handsets ) . The CellSocket sits on your desk and your PCS phone drops into its cradle when you come home . The CellSocket recharges the PCS phone . After unplugging Ma Bell , you plug it in a phone outlet next to the desk . You can use a " tee " to then plug-in your desk phone into the same phone outlet . When there is an incoming call on your PCS phone , the phones in your house ring and callerID displays just like it did with Ma Bell . When you pick up , the sound is as good as your PCS phone . If you are in a good location , it sounds just as good as your wired phone . If you are in a poor coverage area , buy the one with an external antenna jack . You can buy gain antennas to improve reception . To dial , you pick up any phone in the house and hear a special dialtone . Then you dial numbers just like you would on your PCS phone . The # key acts like the Send or Talk key . The CellSocket works just fine with banking applications or voice mail where you need touch tones to navigate around menus . The # key works normally during a phone call . Kids have to be taught this extra step so they can call 911 # if they have to . CellSocket gives my wife one number where she can be reached at home , shopping or on the road . The PCS cell provider 's voicemail catches calls when I am on the phone or not able to answer it . An answering machine can only catch calls when you are not on the phone . It 's really great for providing phone service into areas where you can't get phone service , need it for an emergency line , or simply want to unplug Ma Bell to save some money . The only shortcomings of this product are 1 ) Having to remember to dial # after the number . I find the special dial tone reminds me to dial using the PCS dialing method . 2 ) The Call Waiting feature does not work with CellSocket ( or I did not figure it out yet ) . We don't use it anyway since we don't like being interrupted during a call and know calls are being caught by voicemail . 3 ) When the power fails , and you have an incoming call , only the PCS phone rings . The other phones don't have dialtone . To overcome this , you can plug the charger into a uninteruptable power supply ( UPS ) - the same kind used to keep computers running during a power failure . 4 ) It does not work with computer modems or fax machines . I use a wireless computer connection and an online service like e-fax that converts an incoming fax into an e-mail attachment . Despite these few shortcomings , I like the product very much and highly recommend it . Its savings , particularly on long distance bills and the recurring monthly bills make it very useful for nearly anyone .  
  I was drawn to the sleek design and thought the price wasn't bad either . I bought it for my office where it doesn't get much use ( until after business hours ) . I am constantly fighting with static and station reception and have had to hang the antenna wires all over everything for a clear signal . Now , at about 8 months , the CD player has completely stopped working . This unit no longer reads , recognizes or plays any CD 's not matter what I do . So , now I own a nice looking , static playing radio that if you 're not careful will trip you up in it 's antenna wires .  
  Surprised at the great quality , and with the Amazon supper saver free shipping , this has to be a best buy , they are long enough to have to pay extra shipping via UPS .  
  I bought the CR79 because I wanted something that would look nice in my paneled livingroom . I chose this model specifically because of the external speaker outputs . I thought that if I did not like the sound quality of the built in speakers , I could hook up my own . Let 's take the features of this item one by one , in the order of from the worst to the best . The CR79 has the cheapest looking turntable I have ever seen . It would be very easy to break something just by inattention . I put a good quality stereo record from the 60 's on it , and the sound was like something from the 1930 's or 40 's . My wife described it as " music in a can " . The AM / FM radio is better , but the sound is all in the mid-range , lacking any real base or clear highs . The reception wasn't too impressive , either . The tape cassette was considerably better . But I had never before seen one where you have to open the door by inserting your thumb into a hole and prying it open . No button to push to eject ? The CD player has better sound than the phono , radio or cassette , but wouldn't you expect that anyway ? Even so , it still lacks range . The CR79 's best feature is its appearance . There 's no denying it looks nice sitting there in the living room . It looks well put together , and does not dominate the room . The wood finish looks like a rubbed oil finish that might not be all that durable . A coat of urethane would be a good idea . It 's too bad that the Chinese manufacturer of these units did not make them sound as good as they look . This unit is overpriced for what it delivers . It is not a sound system at all , but really just a home decoration item . I returned it to Amazon the next day and ordered the TEAC DC D6300 . It is everything the Crosley is not and five dollars cheaper as well .  
  For now this may seem unimportant but something down the road happens and I need this plan and I have it . Hallejuea !  
  I wanted something that charges the iPod and plays it through the stereo speakers and the iTrip auto was the simplest product to do exactly that . I haven't had any problems with this except for when I 'm in between bigger cities where the radio stations are mixed I have to find a new frequency to transfer on . I would prefer that the FM transmitter be a little more powerful but all in all this does what I need it to do .  
  This camera case has been very useful so far ; it 's not super attractive , but it 's very practical . A good buy-definitely worth the money .  
  I bought mine 2 months ago , and for no reason at all , while i was taking some vids through my camera , it stopped functioning . I was unable to read the device and now its waiting to end up in the bin . The travelite works fine so far .  
  DONT BUY MAGELLAN ! Totally unreliable , died when I needed it during a trip in Florida . The Call support center has been outsourced to the Phillipines ! I had to send the dead unit to Texas . They have had it for almost one month , cannot fix it and do not have a replacement to ship to me . So I continue to wait in limbo . Will never buy a Magellan again or recommend it to anyone .  
  I love these ear buds ! I keep buying the same pair over and over after they start to go bad . I wear them for at least 10 hours every day / night . They fit comfortably in the ear . The wires will eventually start to crack or break if you move them around a ton , but it takes a good 4-5 months for that to happen and alot of wear and tear put on them in that time ! Haven't even thought of replacing them with a different kind !  
  I followed the directions for setting up with a USB connection and all functions worked flawlessly . There seems to be some confusion on how to use an external telephone answering machine . I connected the external answering machine as described in the drawing . Then I set the FAX mode to manual as described on page 4-1 of the manual . The machine is set by default to answer the phone when it receives the FAX beeping sound from the other end . With this combination , if the incoming call is a voice type , the answering machine answers in the usual way and the FAX machine does not disturb it . If the incoming call is a FAX type , the answering machine answers but the FAX beeping signals activate the FAX machine to receive and it cuts off the telephone answering machine . All in all a satisfactory situation for myself who receives very few FAX transmissions . The unit goes into hibernate when nothing is happening and draws 10 W of power from the line . If you want to save even more energy you can turn the power switch off but the date and time are lost after a few days . I intentionally bought this refurbished version because they have better reliability than new ones . All of the early failures have been found and fixed . You are saved the bother of shipping a defective unit back to the repair station . I especially like the way all functions are run by keys on the unit . On the scan you have several choices for storage of the results . The OCR mode has some problems . When scanning the printout of an email , it missed several strings of asterisks used as separators between text sections . When scanning a legal document with signatures it got confused around the signatures and reformatted the text and made spelling errors . However correcting them was faster than retyping the whole document .  
  Personally the CD type MP3 players are my favorite because theyare much cheaper and hopefully , some time soon , every CD player willhave the ability to play MP3s . D-Link has made a good MP3 player forthe cost . Just remember that you get what you pay for . If you payover [ more $ ] for an MP3 player than you are going to get a featurerich , large capacity type MP3 player . But for [ less $ ] you can't getmuch . Except when it comes to this D-Link branded CD type MP3player .. This MP3 player has a T.Digit function , which I have onlyheard of on this product , that works great . What it does is it letsyou enter the track number of say 103 instead of having to press skipa hundred times . Very Nice ! And of course it has all of the standardfeatures like play , stop , skip , random , etc . I use this mostly in mycar , but when I take a plane trip or something I like to bring italong and only have to bring a couple of CDs instead of my whole CDcollection . Recommended for the value and convenience factor .  
  Batteries were cheaper than in any of the stores in my town . Quick shipping .  
  As the other reviewers have said , they do sound great , but they allow too much sound to escape . I planned to use them at work , but I can't because of that . Get the ear canal types , or the headphones with an enclosure around the entire ear .  
  i purchased the speaker for my grandson who lives with me and he liked it very much so i guess if he liked it then so do i . i was very satisfied with the speed of shipping . thank you  
  This is supposed to be a special cleaning solution - is it really ? I can't say . I might just be buying into the hype , but after using it for years , I love the stuff and trust it . Have smudges , dust , dirt , fingerprints on your device ? This is the stuff you want . I bought the kit with the press-down spray cap ( it looks like there are several versions of the kits available - I can't comment on those ) . The kit does warn against not using it on certain devices ( and checking with the manual that they came with to see if you should use it or not ) . For what I needed it for : cleaning my LCD Monitor , Plasma TV and small devices ( iPhone , iPad , etc .. ) it works great . It doesn't have alcohol , so no need to worry about it eating the protective coatings . A spray is usually good enough for small devices ( more for a big TV ) - spray it directly into the included microfiber cloth ( not onto the TV ) . Not only does it work , it works FAST . You can scrub at an iPhone screen for a couple minutes with a dry microfiber cloth and it 'll clean it - with the ScreenClean kit , you only need to wipe it 1-2 times and you 're done . The bottle mine came with ( 6.76 oz ) is enough to last a long time . I 've had mine for about 3-4 years and still have about 3/4ths of it left . I was surprised to see this was a MONSTER product , considering how inexpensive it was . Is this a necessity ? No . You can probably get by with water and a microfiber , but this will make the process much quicker ( and easier ) , and for that it was definitely worth the ( low ) cost .  
  These Selectors are a fantastic way to organize your DVD 's . We have over 300 DVD 's which would be next to impossible to store in their original holders .  
  I decided to get this 80GB iPod in order to store my CD collection . It seems that I will never run out of space in this iPod . The only problem I 've had so far is that sometimes it stops working for 3 up to 10 seconds , and then it starts working again . This only happens when turning the wheel around and when plugged into the monster cable in the car . I 'm pretty satisfied , though .  
  I had trouble getting the first router to work , even after 2 hours on the phone with a Linksys rep . They determined that the router was defective . ( I found out later that it was a problem with my modem , so probably not the router . ) However , Linksys gave me a case number , and Amazon accepted the return and shipped a new router .. all without shipping charges ! I 'm getting great speeds with the new router ( and new modem ) , and the service from Amazon and Linksys was wonderful !  
  This product works amazingly well on my Palm E2 ! However , Navagator 5.0 , which is what comes with the product , is already out of date . The maps are old . And in trying to update the maps , I find that the Palm E2 is no longer supported . It seems the software requires a more powerful device with Navagator 6.0 . GREAT ! Just great . Larry Coffman  
  External hard drives can be so delicate and it 's important to my peace of mind to spend a little bit more to protect it even if it spends its entire life in a desk drawer and rarely travels ( we 'll see ! ) . This case is good durable quality which is not too soft at all and I trust it with my data . The magenta is a chill color .. something to be said for adding a dash of personality to a pretty standard thing . Fits the Toshiba 320GB HDDR320E04XW nicely with no complaints . All my drive needs is one little USB cord so it fits snug in case 's mesh pocket . Happy stuff .  
  I use this gps holder on my mountain bike and it supports very well all kind of abuse , hits on the ground , vibrations , etc . Very well made product with a strong plastic and a hard fix to the bike .  
  WOW ! Are these really supposed to be less than 40 bucks ? The sound is amazingly full , from classical to jazz to rock . Playing Elgar 's Enigma Variation I could hear the distinct sound of each instrument , from the treble to bass , nothing but clean crisp sound . Chopin 's piano was nothing short of heaven on these headphones . Playing some jazz saxophone , I could hear the player breath ! I have never heard that in this track when I was listening to it all the previous times . Also , you can heard where each note begins and ends , even when the sax part was soft and blanketed by the accompanyment . Moving over to my favorite rock bands , again , deep bass and crisp sound . In summary , unless you want to spend 150 + bucks on some closed and bulky headphones , you won't be able to find anything better than these headphones . And if your budget is under 50 , I don't see how you can choose any other headphone .  
  Remote sending of video + audio + IR control is a good idea planned to be delivered by this artifact . Truth is interference degrades audio and renders video unusable from just 25 feet and one through-wall . Think twice before taking this solution because as 2.4 GHz band is crowded , 5.8 represents hope but performance is subject to a myriad of conditions .  
  MY Ipod Mini is really cool . I got the green one . Its really easy to use and great for car rides , exersising and just for enjoyment . A couple of warnings : If you buy the dock DONT use it all the time because the paint will chip off . Also dont use the Belt clip a lot becuase the paint will chip off too . I would reccomend getting a car charger , apple care , dock , and an armband . Same with armband dont use it a lot because the paint will chip off .  
  I got it for my son 's birthday he absolutely loves them . The price was just right and the quality top notch . I have own apair top-end head phones with noise cancellation and for the price it was perfect .  
  Replaced a couple of basic power strips with this . Looks better & I feel better about using this instead of the power strips . Hope I never have to find out if this protects better or not . Price was better than what I could find locally . Shipping was timely & product arrived before delivery date . Would order again from this seller .  
  The Toshiba AC adapter did not look exactly like the original that it replaced but it works fine . We received it in one week . The original would not stay locked in place , this one does . We haven't had it long enough to say how it will hold up over the long haul . We would purchase it again .  
  I bought this router , ran it for a couple of days to make sure it worked okay , the reloaded it with the ( Linux based ) software from [ .. ] I now have more functionality and can adjust parameters such as the power level ( I increased the 28mw setting to 70mw ) .  
  Purchased this camera recently . A great value when I bought it if you look at features vs . price . Quality of photos very good . Easy to set up camera but you need to make sure the lens cover is fully open to turn camera on . I had trouble understanding how the software communicates with the camera . The docs were not helpful and it looked like I had some kind of communication issue . I email'ed support and got a prompt response . Basically , with Windows ME some of the functions are not required and do not work , eg image transfer via menu item . The software itself is pretty sparse in terms of image editting capability , luckily I have some better software that came with my .. Visioneer scanner . Overall , very happy but they should improve docs and add some more software .  
  This works fine with my MAC Mini and the X10 radio remote antenna .  
  I got this player for Christmas and really like it . It replaced my 20 GB Dell DJ , which i loved , but i wanted a video player . I don't have the " iPod knowledge , " but for those whom never have had an iPod , and want something different , the zune is perfect . It 's screen and video quality are amazing , much better than what i 've seen on iPods . the sound is great , and the player is very simple to use . Plus , i like the music subscription plan of Marketplace . The raido is a big plus too . My complaints are the click wheel can be a hassle if you want to find music quickly ( i was spoiled by the Dell DJ 's scroll bar ) . The software is sometimes a pain , especially if your PC doesn't support it ( i had to download Service Pack 2 to support the Zune Software ) . Yet , with any player there are going to be annoying problems , even the iPod . With the Zune , the good out-weighs the bad by a lot . For those who never had an iPod ( or even if you have ) , the Zune is the best alternative .  
  I bought this item and simply plugged it into the parallel printer port on my printer and then into a USB port on my Dell Studio XPS 9000 running Windows 7 . Windows recognized the printer immediately and automatically installed the printer driver , without my having to do anything else . When I went to Devises and Printers on the Control Panel , my LaserJet 4 Plus showed up as a functional printer ( after a 30-second delay ) . I was then able to print a sample document . No fuss , no problems . After it was all installed , I noticed that it came with an instruction booklet and a little CD . I didn't need to use either .  
  This is a lightweight , well padded backpack that is truly amazing how much you can fit inside - all of my lenses , flash , camera , extra supplies , rocket blower , etc .. amazing ! I used a lowepro 220 slingbag until this one - but this fits almost twice as much , at about the same weight . You won't be disappointed . ONE WARNING : The CANON logo on the bag advertises you have a camera and expensive equipment inside - do not use in dangerous areas where there are pickpockets or other unsavory characters . You might want to put a button or sticker over the Canon Logo if using the bag for travel . Don't leave it lying around in an airport , a train station , or a library .  
  Product arrived on time and functions as described . I would recommend this product for anyone wanting to store a large number of DVD 's or CD 's . The only slight issue is that it 's slightly difficult to zip it shut once a lot of DVD 's are in it . Not a real problem and it gets a little easier once you get used to it . I actually just put it back on the shelf unzipped most of the time as it doesn't really need to be zipped shut to sit on the shelf .  
  These headphones are pretty awesome . They do sound great , and its really neat to feel the bass thumping your ears ( dun listen to them at the highest levels , my ears were ringing for days after i did that ) Its true about what others say about not being able to hear anything else when the headphones are on , well thats one of the reasons it was built . I also tested the headphones with my brother , i put them on full blast and he could barely hear it , i put my old pretty awesome headphones ( i forget the brand , seinhesser ? ) and he could hear every detail and namethe song i was listening to . So these are really great for subway goers or those that like to listen to their music loud and not disturb other people . I only downside to me is the price , its kinda expensive but it still rocks , o and if u tap the wire u can hear it in the headphones , i wonder why it doesn that , its like the stethoscope things doctors use to listen to your heart , my solution to that was to keep the wire a bit tight or secured , so that it doesnt bump into things . I truely reccommend these headphones , they are ultmatly comfortable . I 'm a NYC student , my life is music on the train .  
  I found this camera to be a great investment . The quality of the pictures is impeccable . You have 10 megapixels at your disposal . I purchased the 4 gig stick for the camera and I am able to record somewhere around an hour 's worth of video and you still have room for pictures . The camera creates a slideshow with optional music in the background . Pretty sweet . The only setback that the camera has is a steady cam feature to help eliminate blurry pictures . You have to hold the camera fairly still to capture a good photo . The software is fairly simple as well . For $ 350 , you get a touch screen ( the screen is huge I might add .. ) camera that takes amazing quality photos . Go for it !  
  This is a must for anyone who travels . Simply set up the shot , walk in it and push the button . Now you can be in all those vacation shots instead of behind the camera . The direction remote only works from the front of camera and does have a limited range , approx . 20 ' . Mine came with a nice little pouch that slid onto the camera strap , so it stay with camera at all times and is easily accessible .  
  I 'm a Photojournalist in Mexico , in my work borrow me a Mk IIN but the battery who came with the camera it was too old and lose the charge too fast . I think in buy one but here in Mexico are too expensive like 200 dlls or more and it 's impossible find a gereric . I order this item whit my family in usa , then they send me this to my house in mexico . i put to charge in my original canon charger and when i disconect one of the tiny tubes who came in the contact space broke 's and fall , the charger not charge de battery anymore , i try to fix it whit a cuprum litle tube for make contact and doesn't worki loose my mind and broke the battery ..  
  THESE TAPES WERE VERY CHEAP BUT ONCE YOU ADDED THE SHIPPING IT WAS ABOUT THE SAMES PRICE AS THE REST - TAPES WERE ABOUT $ 4-$5 AND SHIPPING WAS @ $ 15 . OH WELL THE TAPE IS GOOD QUALITY AND I NEEDED THEM .  
  Im not an electronics whiz at the least . Friend suggested this for a low cost dependable power supply to go with new video card , I installed both myself ! which is amazing .. Very simple does its job pushing new video card , 0 problems so far since purchase in june / 09  
  I bought these headphones for online gaming - ventrillo , and such - I am quite impressed . I recommend them .  
  Works amazingly well for the low price point . My Phenom 's cores haven't ever gone past 150ish , even with a full load . And that 's using the standard heatsink-fan combo provided by AMD . More than enough for numerous applications , too ! Awesome Product !  
  I love it and use it all the time ! It 's one of my most useful tools . It always works and works well . I recommend it , highly , to anyone .  
  Picked this keyboard up after I saw it used in an HTPC for less than $ 1,000 article on Engadget to give it a whirl at home . Pros-Cost-Decent trackball accuracy-Comfortable to use whether sitting on your lap , or held in mid-air just navigating . Cons-World 's cheapest quality keyboard . The keys feel horrible . In contrast to the sturdy frame construction , the pretty good trackball , and the mouse / media keys , the actual keyboard is HORRIFIC . - Sleep mode . Sometimes the keyboard goes into sleep mode and there 's no visual indication of this except for the lack of on-screen response . I found that rolling the trackball a few times then hitting the left mouse button brings it out of sleep better than any other method . Which admittedly makes absolutely no sense , but IT WORKS ! - Have to keep a spare wired keyboard around because with this keyboard you can't access BIOS settings or force the PC to boot from CD / DVD instead of HDD . - Misses keystrokes . This is probably due to the crappy keyboard quality , but if you type reasonably fast this thing misses letters all over the place . Good enough for a quick IM , but don't write an e-mail to your boss . Other thoughts .. Despite the keyboard quality , I would recommend this keyboard to others who are looking for something simple yet effective . Just don't try putting the adapter anywhere other than line-of-sight maybe fifteen feet . My PC sits behind a smoked glass door with the rest of the home entertainment gear , otherwise this thing would stick out like a unicorn horn .  
  Great price for this cable to connect my Sony Hi8 Camcorder to my Tivo to transfter some old analog videos to my Tivo DVR . Great value !  
  Recommendation : I 'd buy this if you want this particular combination of features . But to get the features there are large compromises in performance . In this review , I will mention the Gecko 201 , Quest , and Vista C. These are other units made by Garmin . I own a 201 and a Quest ( early version ) but have not yet used the other unit or the later Quest 's . Driving : When placing it on the dash I am forced to compromise between seeing the display and aiming the antenna outside of the car for reception , since the antenna is in the body of the unit . The effect depends on the design of the car ( how big the windows are , I would guess . ) On the Quest , the antenna flips up and it does not have this problem . Sunlight reflecting off the front face of the unit into the driver 's eyes is sometimes a problem , and aiming to unit to fix this can compromise reception and / or readability . The battery life is short enough that I find a car plug necessary ( at additional cost ) . However , the battery life can be extended by disabling features . It is not able to find automobile routes , such as the Vista C or Quest can do . I find that when I compare the cost of a Vista ( plus maps and plug ) with , say , a Quest ( where these are included ) , they are pretty much the same . So I would not get a Vista if the only planned use was extensive route finding while driving . The Quest is a much better solution . Hiking : I live in California . Here there are grassy hills to tree covered hills . I find that my main area of concern is finding my location when in the trees since in other areas I can navigate with a map ( the GPS does not rule out needing a map , even with the topo map CDs ) and my eyes . I have been comparing the reception of the Vista with my Gecko 201 , and find that the 201 gets noticably stronger signals . This results in the 201 getting faster , better positions , and getting positions where the Vista will not , such as in moderate tree cover , which is where I 'd really want a position . I find that e-compass and e-altimeter do not outweigh the fact I cannot get a position lock . So if your only planned use is hiking , I 'd get something with better reception , and a Silva " Ranger " style compass . I am finding that when I switch on / off the compass feature ( to save battery life , the compass is a noticable drain ) the software in the unit crashes and it shuts off . A pain , but not a fatal one . However , all the preceeding being said , if you want a single unit that can get you to a park , then navigate around the park , and back to the car , this unit is cheaper that two separate GPS units for each aplication . And it nicely fits into a pocket for hiking . I also hear that geocachers like them since they need to get close to the cache in the car , and then take the unit out of the car to find the cache . I could see this unit being nice in that application .  
  Love these little cameras . Easy smeezy to setup and use . Great reception . Bought one 6 months ago for a laptap .. loved it so much , just bought another from my PC .  
  Well almost a year later I guess this has done its job . For those with a standard 15.4 " screen , I would probably recommend something else . I thought it would stretch , as other reviewers had mentioned , but I ended up with small holes in the two bottom corners . It has protected the outside of the computer , but it is a struggle every day getting it in . It was inexpensive , but I still have to drop it from my original 4 stars to 3 stars . - The major draw to this item was the price , $ 14.99 . It is a bit tight on my Dell computer , but it serves the purpose - protecting it while it is in my backpack . I will say that after reading a previous reviewers comments on the metal bodyglove logo scrating the top of his laptop , I do place the computer in the sleeve upside down .  
  This item is incorrectly labeledDYMO White Tape / Black Print 1/2 Inch x 23 feet , D1 Style Cartridge ( 45013 ) . 45013 is black tape with white print . 45113 is white tape with black print .  
  The Good : Small , lightweight , inexpensivedecent soundThe Bad : The battery life on this thing is awful . In under two hours the thing is completey drained . This is made worse by the fact thateven when it 's " off " it still has an active display , furtherdraining the single AA batteryInterface is not intuitive ( then again what do you expect for something this small ) Headphones . Simply put , they stink . Those people with large ears may find them perfect though . Memory size is limited , and not upgradeable . Conclusion : The mini-yepp is an expensive , decent piece of equipment . Howeverit 's not worth the money . Its performance does not meet the specifications that are outlined in the product description and Iwould advise anyone looking for an mp3 player to avoid this modelunless they have money to burn .  
  This case looks really great in your hand walking around . It always catches someone 's eye . It also looks really expensive . You can tell it was made to last with the white thread against the black leather accent . There is only one tiny thing I don't like and it 's the material inside the case . It often leaves traces of the black fibre on the camera but only detectable if you hold as close as your nose , but like I say that 's very minor .  
  Product worked great for 1 year and inexplicably the HD failed and no longer works . As an IT person , I 've tried everything ( swapping out cables , power and even tried connecting the device to my laptop and backup PC ) . It was good while it lasted . Now I 've lost 100GB of data . If you plan on buying , please remember to backup your LaCie HD .  
  I bought these to use in my digital camera , an SD device that supports MicroSDHC with SD Adaptors . And these MicroSDHC cards worked fine - once I tested them in a friend 's adaptor . But the adaptors that came with this didn't work at all , which made the whole product useless to me . I contacted the seller ( Digital Media Source ) for a refund , and never heard back .  
  Seems like good quality , and fairly inexpensive . I 'd probably go with the targus UV + Polarizer for $ 20 , though . Silver color doesn't look as bad as I thought it would , but I prefer black .  
  .. but in this case an inferior product . There are better ones out there with more functionality and better quality .  
  This fan came shipped in it 's original box , not within another box which was fine , saves on packaging . The item was easy opening and although it came with instructions I didn't need them to assemble due to minimal parts and common sense . The fan is not really a hard plastic , and the guard is also made of plastic but it is fairly quiet and really throws a lot of wind so I 'm satisfied . Will it last ? Time will tell . I think if it falls over it may be prone to breaking since it 's all plastic .. just don't tip it over .  
  It 's hard to believe that you can purchase so much performance for less than $ 40 . This little radio has the ability to fill a large room with undistorted sound from any of its 12 bands . Moreover , it is quite easy to use . Sensitivity and voice clarity are remarkable . The automatic gain control deals nicely with weak and strong signals . Selectivity is quite good , but one could use a larger tuning knob ( or I suppose in my case , smaller fingers ) to make those fine adjustments easier . The size of the radio makes it easy to pack . Although you get a lot of radio for a few dollars , it would have been nice if Sangean had included an AC adaptor . I have used this radio a lot since I purchased it , and it does have a hardy appetite for batteries when played at high volume . Accordingly , I purchased an AC adaptor for it . I tried several adaptors before I settled on the Radio Shack 4.5 volt " International " model ( cat . no . 273-1759 ) . This device accepts almost any input voltage and frequency and produces a full amp of filtered , regulated DC . Unlike other adaptors I tried , this one is relatively " quiet . " It does not induce hum or electrical noise . Best of all , it folds up in a very small travel package . If you don't want to spend a lot of cash on a multi band radio , but want to be able to listen to stations wherever you may travel , the SG622 should work well for you .  
  This is my first Kensington product . I use a Microsoft Exlporer trackball at work and really love it ( even though I usually hate everything Microsoft ) . At home I had a Logitech trackball ; one that was thumb controlled and it was killing my hand and wrist . I bought the Kensington because I 'd heard a lot of positive reviews of the Kensington products . I have problems with the curser stalling , the buttons are poorly positioned and after about an hour or so of working it starts to make my hand cramp and my wrist hurt . I really wish it had a scroll wheel on it because it 's awkward to hold the button and control the ball at the same time . I 'm a graphic designer and constantly on my computer so this has been a real problem .  
  Especially at Christmas time , the labeler comes in very handy and these wider labels are especially good for card addressing , etc . Recommended .  
  It 's speaker wire , what more could you expect ? 1 ) It 's white so it blends with white walls , and 2 ) it 's color coated . My only complaint is that the color is more of an off-white / cream , not a big deal though . Does the job .  
  Do not buy anything from Pinnacle . Their software deceptively leads you to believe that you need to purchase further programs to burn DVDs . I did so and got incorrect activation codes twice before requesting a refund which they have refused to give even though the product does not work and meets their advertised return policy . I have filed a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive trade policies and knowingly offering defective products .  
  I was very enthusiastic about this purchase . The design is amazing and it was the perfect product of my needs .. on paper . But , after using it several times in SD card mode without a hitch , I switched it to USB Stick mode and it just flat out rebooted the computer . My guess is that it created a surge in the USB 2.0 port on my Lenovo T60p which are not known to fail . I tried again , same result this time with XP not being able to recognize the card . When it was removed from the USB port , the computer restarted again . Now no device I have can recognize it . This could be a fluke based on all the other reviews ( why I bought the card ) but not mine .  
  Ear Buds are a disaster . I just discovered this . I am over 50 and figured my hearing was going ( which to a certain degree it is of course ) . After increasing the ripping quality for my CDs and still having issues with hearing stuff I decided to look into ear phones as a possible problem . They sure were .. these are great for the gym . I also bought some Sanheisers ( SP ? ) for twice the price and they are great also but too heavy for the gym . And too goofy looking even for me on a tread mill . I recommend this product .  
  I was very impressed with the price and the quality of this memory card for my digital camera ! Highly recommend !  
  Quality product from Panasonic - length is just about perfect for connecting my HD Cable settop to a Pana . plasma screen . Recommended .  
  Initially when I saw this product I was thinking whether to buy Memory sticks on brands other than Sony . I just had my Sony Clie and I wanted to get the largest possible memory sticks available . Lexar sells their sticks about half the price of Sony . So I bought it ( actually a few ) , and I have absolutely no problems with it . No files have been lost on the stick ( I have used it for more than half a year ) , and the access speed is OK too . Packaging is excellent , takes forever to rip it open though :p With this price it is definitely worth while .  
  I bought this printer for my son-in-law . He wanted a wireless printer , and pleased with the product .  
  Purchased this item to survey a remote lake . Interested in bottom morphology and structure more than fish . Worked very well . As stated in the specs , you must use at slow speeds . Over 5mph it loses the bottom and gives strange readings . But below 5mph gives very good and accurate bottom and structure readings with decent detail for an inexpensive and portable system . Would prefer a much smaller / lighter weight battery option than the sealed lead acid battery . Otherwise met all expectations and needs .  
  I had the " opportunity " to view this player at one of BB 's Magnolia stores . It was connected via HDMI to a high-end Sony 1080p RPTV , playing a Blu-Ray demo disc . The first thing I noticed was an unexpected fuzziness and graininess to the image . Since it was a movie clip I just thought , " well , OK .. I guess it 's normal for film to have grain , right ? " However , as the disc progressed into a chapter of digital still pictures ( presumably to demonstrate the steadiness of the image ) , I was even less impressed . I watched , somewhat off-put , as a centuries-old book panned jerkily onto the screen . Once the panning finally stopped , the richly calligraphed pages of the open book could easily be read ( albeit with noticeable ghosting around the letters ) . But then , when an ancient style world map appeared on the screen , I literally winced . The violent vibration from the closely spaced lines reminded me of a flickering 1980 's computer monitor running 1024x768 at 60Hz . A whole section of the map was shimmering , and not in a good way . I couldn't watch any more , and I walked out of the store with a headache I didn't have when I entered . If Sony 's own demo of their Blu-Ray player is this bad , they can keep it .  
  Cable was delivered quite fast and works as expected for a very reasonable price .  
  ITs good .. its ok .. Its nice and cormfortable , but i never knew a 17in bag was like tat big and im only 14 .. so .. the bag felt big and long .. but if ur 17 + it would be good .. Design is great .. Cormforatble .. feature . ss .. wat else u need .. justa buy it .. Its good .. comes with warranty too ! LOL .. G2gFeeli like i have no life  
  I have three of these drives and have been using one or another of them for quite a few months . No problem with storage , but the click-to-engage dongle requires a bit of care . Oh yes , and the drive tries to install and run its built-in buggy backup software . This can be nasty under Windows , but only a minor annoyance under Linux because it only pops up a notification icon and doesn't run . For all the users who have had these drives " fail " .. perhaps the problem is not the hardware , but the OS . The Windows USB drivers may just be a bit buggy ( and theauto-execute backup software , see above , may lock up the machine ) . I haven't had a problem with them running under Linux , but then if the Gnome or KDE window manager fails to mount or eject , I can always do it manually from an xterm window . The real problem is Windows users who don't really understand computers . It 's as if you didn't know how to check the oil or change a flat on your car . Maybe you shouldn't be driving if that 's the case . Maybe you shouldn't be using a computer if you don't know how to diagnose and fix simple problems .  
  These speakers are awesome for their size . Great sound for DVD surround sound and cd 's . Very adequate subwoofer for a small room . Also purchased the matching surround back speaker and it too works well . Good buy for the price if you are looking for small speakers .  
  nice basic splitter . flat response ( 0.2 %) through WUXGA . DDC pass-through on port 1 , 5 volts supplied on pin 9  
  Set this up without any problems ( no tech support ! ) and have been using wirelessly for over one week without any problems .  
  This bag is everything I hoped that it would be . It 's comfortable to carry , holds all of my books and my computer . The zipper top makes it very easy to access what is inside without having to open the front flap . I highly recommend this bag .  
  My first impression of this lens was that it was much smaller than the pictures make it out to be . Only about 3 inches long by 2 inches in diameter . But boy does it make your photos pop . I 've been reading a lot of reviews about the new Pentax K7 , considering upgrading from my K10D . But one review I read , criticized consumers for wasting time always upgrading their camera body , when what really matters is the glass . Well , I can say , that guy was right . I took the money I was going to use on a new body and spent it on 2 high quality lenses . One of them was this macro . I 'm not disappointed . It 's like my camera is brand new and my photographic abilities have been improved . I bought this lens for flowers and insects . It works amazingly . At times the focus does " hunt " a bit , but I think that 's my camera more than the lens . I was expecting tight , crisp , high detail close ups and that 's exactly what I 've been getting . I 've heard others say this makes a great portrait lens . Well , they 're right . I didn't know why until I gave it a shot . Because this lens is macro and has such shallow focus capabilities , it tends to throw the background into a very soft buttery bokeh . This makes your subject really jump out of the photo . The effect is subtle but very pleasing and your portraits will be much improved I promise . So this is a double duty lens and it works great for both . Add to that , it 's small and light and it 's easy to toss in the camera bag for when you need it . Someone else mentioned the focus action is a bit " crunchy " but I think they may have the focus clamp on . If you accidentally bump that to " on " position , it tried to hold the focus . You can still turn the focus ring though but it requires more effort and makes a slight grinding noise . Don't do this and you 'll be just fine .  
  I 'll be short simple an to the key points here .. NOT A SONY BULB ! Don't be fooled or mislead . It 's similar in look feel fit and performance but it 's clearly NOT a Sony bulb . Sure it costs a fraction of the price of the SONY version but don't be mislead .. Performance and build are from what i 've seen better than alot of the other knock off 's and copy cat 's out there but you will know when comparing side by side , it 's not a SONY bulb .  
  A solid polarizer , nicely build and includes a small hardcase to store when not in use . If you are looking for a polarizer I can certainly recommend this one . I have been using mine for almost a year now , all across the Northern American Hemisphere , without problem . Before you buy it , make yourself a favor and read on its uses . Chances are you don't need it and are better of without it . Otherwise , go for it !  
  This remote is easy to program . However , the buttons on this often stick . For instance if I want to enter 5 it will enter 55 . Or if I want to recall the previous channel it will go to the channel and immediately go back to the channel I was watching . A little annoying .  
  I purchased this device after running my boat aground on a sand bar . I was going very slow and didn't damage my boat . I would not advise installing it yourself unless you are very capable . I drove my car and boat to Best Buy and their marine installer did a fine job . It works great and warns me of any hiding sand bars .  
  POSTED 09/27/04 : I purchased this unit about three weeks ago and so far , overall , I have been very happy with it . Below are some things I really like and dislike about the Panasonic VCR / DVD Recorder . LIKES : 1 . DVD-RAM : CHASE feature . With this feature , similar to a DVR , you can start watching the program that is being recorded before it has finished recording OR you can watch another program on the same disc . Chase also allows you to pause live TV , backup to see something again , etc . Chase mode even works when dubbing tapes . If you are one of those people , like me , that is constantly backing up the tape to see / hear something again , this will save wear and tear on the VCR . 2 . DVD-RAM : 1.33x playback . It speeds up the audio , but doesn't change the pitch . Not really suitable for movies or dramas , but it does allow you to quickly watch news and documentaries . With this feature and skipping commercials I can watch an hour long documentary in just over 30 minutes . 3 . DVD-RAM : Easy trimming and editing of recordings allows you to cut out commercials and make more room on the disc . Shows can be divided too and chapter marks added . 4 . DUBBING : Easy and clean dubbing VHS to DVD . Just cue and pause the tape and then when you hit DVD record it starts the recording and unpauses the tape at the same time . Only a couple frames of the paused image get recorded . Commercials can be removed this way too if you want to take the time . VCR on-screen messages are suppressed when recording , so you don't have to worry about a " PLAY " becoming part of your recording . I actually find this manual method of dubbing better than the ONE-TOUCH dubbing option , which doesn't give as much control . This also works for DVD to VCR dubbing , but the procedure is a bit more complicated . 5 . You CAN record two shows at once , one to the VCR and the other to DVD . However , you can only do one TUNER ( Channel # ) recording at a time , so one or both recordings must be via AV inputs . 6 . Remote control of the VCR and DVD is mostly the same . 7 . The clock seems to keep accurate time , having gained only about 3 seconds in 3 weeks . 8 . VCR : A VP recording speed which is 5x longer than SP and doesn't look much worse than EP . With VP speed you can record 13h 20m + on a T160 or 16h 40m + on a T200 . Not compatible with most other VCRs though . 9 . VCR : 35x search mode . Clean picture with little noise too . 10 . VCR : Super fast Rewind and also a Jet Rewind , both take less than a minute to rewind a T160 tape . DIS-LIKES : 1 . No digital zoom on DVD Player . I have poor vision and the zoom feature on my last DVD player allowed me to see small print without getting closer to the TV , so I really miss the zoom feature ! 2 . The manual is confusing and dis-organized ( see 02/19/05 update ) , but it is also complete so I suggest reading it from cover to cover . 3 . No frame advance on the VCR , just pause and slow motion . And the slow motion is awkward to use . 4 . Many features only available on DVD-RAM . ( Do download the manual from Amazon and look at the RAM DVD-R , etc . headers to see what recording formats each feature supports . ) 5 . CD-Audio playback is too loud and muffled and sounds terrible , at least on my TV . It could be my TV , but output from DirecTV as well as TV , DVD , VHS and MP3 playback from this unit all sound great on the same TV . 6 . Quality of LP and EP DVD recordings is really bad during scenes with smoke / steam / fog . Scenes with fast motion also cause some digital artifacts too . However , these could be problems with all DVD Recorders in general and not just the Panasonic . Anyway , despite the above problems I am really pleased with this unit . The pluses definitely outweigh the negatives . Unless something better comes on the market I would get another one if I needed a second VCR / DVD recorder * UPDATE 02/19/05 : * Having used this unit for several months now I just want to add that I still find it to be an excellent machine . The Time-Slip ( simultaneous record and play and chasing playback ) have changed how I watch TV . I rarely watch a program live anymore , or when I do , I wait until it is about 1/3rd over so I can watch it in chase mode and skip the commercials . The flexible recording mode has been wonderful for recording programs and copying tapes to DVD-R . Flexible Recording calculates the necessary bitrate to fit a recording on a disc at the best possible quality . Many recorders limit you to fixed rates , such as 2 or 4 hours . With FR , if a program or tape is 2 hours and 10 minutes long it can be recorded at near SP ( or 2 hour ) quality instead of having to be recorded at a noticeably lower quality . While Flexible Recording is not available for One-Touch Dubbing , it can easily be done manually . Just tune to the " TP " ( tape ) channel before starting Flexible Recording . I 've found that many commercial tapes can be copied . Don't assume like I did at first that none can . Use a DVD-RAM disc or scrap DVD-R to do some test recordings of all your tapes and see which you can backup to DVD-R . More than 50 % of the tapes I own can and don't give the copy protected message . For time-shift recording I recommend you get some double sided DVD-RAMs in cartridges . The cartridge protects the discs from dirt and dust which can cause write errors . While you do have to flip the discs to use the other side , a double sided cartridge takes up no more room than a single side cartridge or two single sided non-cartridge DVD-RAMs . If you need to record more than 4 hours and can't change discs and don't want to record to DVD in EP mode , you can use the VCR too . VHS may be a step backwards from DVD , but VHS-SP looks a lot better than DVD-EP . The VHS recording can then be copied to another DVD-RAM for editing . Regarding the manual , if you buy this unit then be sure to download the manual from Amazon . You can then use the PDF viewer to search for the feature or function you need to learn how to use . Trust me , it 's a lot quicker to fire up the computer than trying to find what you want to know in the printed manual . * UPDATE 10/6/05 * The manual says that timer recordings cannot be executed on both DVD and VHS at the same time and that timer recordings can not overlap . However , I discovered recently that this is not true . Two timer recordings can be made simultaneously , provided they are not from different channels . You can record L1 and L2 at the same time or a combination of either L1 or L2 and a tuned channel . I 've also discovered that if you are recording to DVD-RAM and are not playing a title then hitting Time-Slip will begin playback at 30 seconds from the end of the recording . This is a useful feature when you have the TV on in the background and have one of those " What was that ? " moments . :)  
  I gave these speakers as a gift to my husband , he has been thrilled with them . He is an avid gamer and they work great with all of his games . Highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for 2.1 speakers .  
  I didn't think I would be too into the whole Tivo thing when I bought this for my husband , but WOW , it relly does change how you watch tv ! I just wish I would have bought the 80-hr . one , so I wouldn't have to wonder when shows might be deleted to make room for new ones . This one works excellent though , it did stop and reboot a couple times since we had it , but I 'm sure it needed to do so to run properly . Nothing erases when this happens , it just takes about 5 or 6 minutes to start up again , everything is still there when it comes back . Just so you know if you by one , you do have to pay for monthly service and it does need to be connected to a phone line ( I had to run a 50 ft . cord long the ceiling from my kitchen since our living room doesn't have a hookup ) .  
  Without exception , this is the WORST PRODUCT I have ever purchased on Amazon . My wife needed these tapes to record an important meeting and the need was so urgent I had them shipped overnight to her hotel for the meeting the next day . After that considerable expense , the tapes were no good . The first one out of the package had a loose end that had come off the reel . I was able to use a small piece of clear tape to re-attach it to the spindle . When she returned home and tried to transcribe the tapes , we found that they were full of drop-outs and sounded like you were rotating the microphone while recording . Her previous tapes were another brand and they worked fine so we know that the recorder is fine . The minimum allowed rating is one star or I would have given it a zero ! Caveat emptor  
  Very nice . Attractive and stylish . Fits in purse , very compact . Has good clasp , well made from good leather . Places for spare chips . Not one thing I was disappointed in . not disappointed in any thing about the case . You will be pleased with this product .  
  After using this lense only a couple times I knew it was a must have for anyone using the R1 that wanted close up photos . Great product at a great price on amazon .  
  This product is bad . Returned it right away . The signal drops . Additionally , there is ghosting across the screen on both monitors . My display was simple 1280x1024 .  
  I bought the Wolverine Data FlashPac 7-in-1 Memory Card Reader to take with me on a 3 week tour of Italy . The cost was more than offset by the cost of memory cards for my camera that I did not have to buy . It really was a one button operation and the batteries lasted the entire trip without recharging . There was a charger if I needed it . I used only 3 GB of memory and downloaded over 1000 photos . It is a nice compact , efficient machine .  
  They can't support this properly - beware . A simple question on how to connect this wirelessly they can't provide help . They then actually had the nerve to tell me to seek support from the retailer ! Beware .  
  This product basically does what it 's supposed to do .. however - it also occasionally does strange actions , has to have cabling disconnected and reconnected to work again , and has an annoying " beep " that cannot be turned off . Sounds like I don't like it , eh ? Well , despite these drawbacks , it works well for the most part ( 97 + % of the time ) , making my life between work and home easier by saving all that space on my home office desk . So .. I can recommend it , but with the above drawbacks . If anyone knows of a better product or an update for this one , please let me know !  
  Does what it says . Provides a nice case to carry around my buds . No complaints .  
  Great sound , but the cord is too short , even if you use an MP3 player on an armband . If you turn your head while exercising , you will pull the left ear bud right out . The right one has a longer cord and will hold . They do give you an extension cord , but it is too long and the connection point is too heavy . The excess weight will also pull on the earbuds and the left one ( with the shortest slack ) will come out . On a five-mile ride / run I had to readjust this set several times . If not for the amazing sound , I would have given this product just one star . It would be a good set of headphones if you listen to music while lounging indoors .  
  the detector i bought does not fit on the clip . Sold as it would and no goodEscort 57-000027 Visor Clip Mount for Radar and Laser Detectors  
  Since this was my first time installing a wireless router , I was somewhat nervous if I could do it correctly and easily . Being a computer literate person that I am , I knew that installing the hardware was the easy part . But I was also pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it was setting it up wirelessly with my laptop . I definitely could have used this right out of the box wirelessly with my laptop , but I prefer to have certain security features turned on / off while I am online . And if you don't know what features to turn on / off , you can use the included CD to walk you through it . The size of this wireless router is very small . Its range is also very good for my small apartment . And so far , I haven't experienced any slowdown or loss of connection yet . In conclusion , I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive wireless router with standard features .  
  The software that comes with this printer is AWFUL . It hangs up for no reason and I have to reboot my PC to clear the print queue . It has annoying behavior , for example when you print double sided it immediately presents a popup window telling you to flip the pages when the first set it finished . The problem is you can't minimize this window and do something else on your pc . You have to wait until all pages finish printing . Extremely annoying . I have had to throw away two cartridges due to the " cartridge not intended " issue . I know I installed HPs patch after the first time , but it did not work . This is absolutely the last HP product I will ever buy .  
  I bought this months ago for $ 12.99 ! Included the Sennheiser earbuds . MP3 Music quality is great through those , or connected to quality PC speaker system ( with subwoofwer ) . FM radio quality was fair ( no real antenna ) , and recording Mic or from radio was weak . But I bought it for the MP3 - and LOW price . Of course , the screen is too small for middle aged people such as myself to read without glasses , and the 700 mAh Ni-Cd battery I use barely powers it for 8 hours .. but what do you expect for $ 13 . If I had paid more , I would expect a larger display , and the ability to both play and recharge a rechargeable battery when plugged into PC or other USB power source ( AC wall adapter or Auto adapter ) . ALSO , I expect newer units will accept SD MICRO cards , so they won't stick out from the case . Overall , I would buy again ( for same price ) , or for a gift for someone .  
  Pictures are beautiful printed on this paper . I prefer glossy versus matte finish and have been very happy with the results .  
  DYMO Labeling Tape , D1 , Split Back , adhesive , Easy Peel , " x 23 ' , ( 45013 ) , Black Print on White Tape . I purchased this to use with my new Dymo Label-er . It works very well with it . It was shipped very quickly . I am pleased with my purchase .  
  The reason for buying this is to replace the exact same one the was stolen from our car . We have had other ones .. itrip , etc .. but they have problems getting washed out by local stations . This one can automatically screen for the best chanels making the job easier , and it can also go into the 87 's , below most transmitters making it great for long drives . My son loves the replacement so I actually bought an additional one for my other son with the same degree of success . If you can keep your kids from complaining about a product , that is a degree of product success . It also has more broadcast power than other units so that helps it maintain a good signal . Label this review as buying what works !  
  I got this to hopefully improve my ping and FPS with WoW and Lord of the Rings Online . There was no noticeable difference vs . the integrated NIC on my motherboard ( Gigabyte Nvidia 590 series ) . I have the most recently drivers for my mobo and I feel that is about the best you can do in that regard . Don't waste your money on one of these - save it for a better graphics card or CPU .  
  I just purchased these radios for my family and they work really well ! The ergonomics are well thought out , they fit into our kids ' hands easily , and they are completely simple to operate and fun to use . I 'd recommend this pair for any family . The clarity of the transmission is exceptional . They also have eliminator codes that help keep out other spurious conversations . The kids especially like the different call tones to signal the other radio . No complaints on this end ! Enjoy !  
  This is one great lens . I had used the 18-55 lens before , and wanted a little extra lens . This lens provided everything I wanted . The extra length was a great enhancement , and the IS is totally incredible . This is one versatile lens , and may be the last lens you ever buy , unless you need a true telephoto ! After buying a Canon 30D ( without lens ) I debated on the standard zoom lens , but am more than thrilled that I went with this one . Extra length and the IS give you the best of both worlds . Great lens !  
  I installed this in one of my SUV 's that is not driven for weeks at a time . The Schumacher unit keeps a perfect charge and does not overheat or dry out the battery . The clock , radio , and GPS settings are all preserved and the charger does not seem to draw much power when the battery is charged . I am very satisfied with the operation of the unit . The installation was a breeze with the included hardware and the instructions were clear and easy . I do have two small complaints , however :( 1 ) The battery lugs were way too big for my vehicle and all other cars that I checked . ( 2 ) The AC plug is too short to run anywhere . I wanted the plug to reach to just outside the vehicle 's grill , so that the unit could be plugged in without opening the hood . I had to install an extra extension cord for that purpose .  
  This is my second digital camera , the first also an Olympus . With so many features and shooting modes , I did study the manual . I first found that shooting without a flash indoors using the " auto " mode or the " P " ( program ) mode produced fuzzy images , but using the " Scene - Portrait with Available Light " function , indoor shots are clear . I love not having a removable / losable lens cap . The built in lens cover retracts as the camera turns on . The " Scene - Sports " feature produced incredibly sharp action photos at our local rodeo . The macro and super-macro feature is very good . Closeup flower images come out clear even with a little breeze blowing . I like having an optical view finder . The 5x zoom coupled with the seamless 4x digital zoom ( 20x max zoom ) produced a surprisingly sharp closeup . The one thing that isn't good - and it may be so with all digital still cameras - is the movie feature . The resolution is very low and capturing one frame for use as a photo is useless . Seems to me my older digital did a better job of using a movie to capture a child leaping from a dock so that I could select one frame from the movie to print . Perhaps I need more experience . My previous camera used AA batteries , and this one does too , so my stock of rechargeable AA batteries hasn't gone to waste . The size and weight of the camera are good . The camera comes with the Advanced Manual on CD rom , in PDF format . This is a bit of a pain if you want to have the manual with you , but at least you can print it in any size , and omit the parts ( like how to print photos ) you don't need . The manual is fairly easy to understand and navigate . The camera is easy to use ( once you know where everything is ) and I 'm very happy with it . I still have much to learn and will probably like it even more . I gave it a 4-star rating only because of the movie problem . Update : After using the camera for several months I 've noted several problems with it . It badly over-exposes when using the " scene " menu . So far , only the point-and-shoot auto settings have resulted in good photos . Doing comparison shots with my old 2.1mp Camedia 2040 , and a Nikon Coolpix , all three did a good job on automatic settings . When switching to " Scene " mode for the Sport Zoom , either in " sport " or " landscape " mode , the photos were horribly over-exposed in late afternoon lighting . Olympus has a way to fix this , I think , but when you 're in a hurry for a photo , just use the " auto " mode or buy another camera . Instead of 4 stars , I 'd give it a 2 1/2 .  
  This mini tripod is a pretty good basic design , but to work in practice I had to cut a couple of inches off the center post and swap out the head for a decent ball head . The plastic pan head is simply not strong enough to hold anything but a point and shoot . Certainly not a D800 . The head 's main problem is the plastic hinge that allows the camera to be rotated into vertical . It 's supposed to be an additional feature but makes the head so " floppy " that at best you can only shoot static shots : forget panning or tilting during a video take . It 's also very difficult to level the horizon . That hinge again . It simply can't be tightened enough to hold the camera level . The suction cup on the center post is supposed to attach to a flat surface , but the surface has to be perfect to work . Not likely . The cup deteriorated after a couple of years , too , becoming superfluous . Worse , with the legs retracted to their shortest ( and most stable ) position the center post has to be extended upwards . Now the camera is really top heavy and , again , the whole thing is unstable . I speak from trying to shoot video clips in Washington DC , where you aren't allowed to use a full-sized tripod . So I carried this little guy , setting it on domed trash receptacles or benches . Those domes together with That excessively long center post made it almost impossible to use . It wasn't up to the job . I came home and shortened the center post , removed the pan head and replaced it with a sturdy ball head . Still can't really pan , but can at least level the horizon . I 'd recommend a different setup . After I got done cutting the center post and adding aGiottos MH1302-655 Professional Calibrated Ball Head with MH 655 Quick ReleaseI should have gotten theSUNPAK MINI-PROPLUS / B Mini Tripod with Compact Ballhead .  
  I thought I had already reviewed this purchase .. I ordered four sticks , got four sticks and tested them in a 1.3 GHZ P4 System overclocked and had no problems . I have a spare stick and expecvt no problemsThe price was great and the products worked as advertised .  
  The tape cartridges arrived as promised within the expected time-frame . All the cartriges were put into service successfully with no failures . We 've had to return some we 've ordered from others in the past , because the were unusable right out of the box . All six of these are hard at work !  
  I 've been using these headphones for almost two years now , practically every night ! They always sound great and have never caused me any problems ! It 's not really fair to compare these headphones with corded headphones but considering the freedom the RS-85 gives you to roam around without pulling a cord behind you , I think these headphones are a great value ! I strongly recommend the RS-85 to anyone looking for a quality wireless headphones !  
  I am highly disappointed with this device . It has a very annoying soft-power off if I don't interact with it for about 15 minutes . This power-saving feature is understandable and I can basically deal with it by a left click . But it gets worse from here . Sometimes the above procedure fails . You need to completely power-down ( remove battery cover ) and reset . For the past week or so it required that I comletely redo the bluetooth pairing / discovery process . Today it is impossible to detect the device . In less than a month , this mouse has completely failed . I 'm returing it to where I got it . Based on other reviews I 've read , I 'm not the only person experiencing these types of problems . I 'm not even interested in a replacement . I 'll get a competing brand .  
  The lens arrived packaged in the box . Took it out and put on my rebel . The manual focus ring initially moves smoothly then gets kinda stuck along the way and at the long end gives again producing a jerky and unpleasant effect . In auto focus there 's a grinding sound as if there 's sand in the mechanism and it does not focus fast . I was able to take a few pictures but the problems w / both manual and auto focus is not what you 'd expect from a 1000 $ lens . I returned it .  
  I feel misled by the rave reviews here and elsewhere . I jumped at this given the price and others ' praise . The latter was misplaced ; the former wasn't low enough . The MM22 might be fine for a hotel room , but it 'd better be a damned quiet hotel . I have trouble hearing the damned thing even when I press it to my ears . Yes , I 've found the volume buttons , and yes it makes a difference - from inaudible to barely audible . The design is cute , the carrying case is nice ( though excessive unless you need to carry all 3 cables and all 3 adapters , which you won't ) , and the price is low . But cheap is cheap , and this one 's not the effort .  
  I just got this cable . My first problem was that the CD that came with it had no drivers for en EnV VX9900 phone . After I found the drivers on the web , I found out that this cable will not charge the phone when it is connected to the USB port .  
  It is what it is .. perfection ! Its Domke i.e. high and reputable quality . It allows for a lot of storage of gear , junk , throwing stars and anything else you would want to put in a utility belt pouch . I have my belt modeled after Batman 's belt , except I carry back-up batteries , CF cards , a Quantum battery pack and the required cables for of camera flash shooting . So , its big enough for the reasonable user . Buy it . Buy it now . You will not regret it .  
  Still going strong after 10 years , amazing ! We use it often and at times very heavily . Have been using generic ink from Amazon for years with no problems and this thing never has a paper jam . Hope my next one does as well .  
  Takes a bit of messing around to tune all the right settings for various apps . Wouldn't be without it . You can make it as fast and responsive as you want . Love it for surfing the web , mail , osx Finder and of course Photoshop and Bridge .  
  Memorex discs are always a good deal . I use them for DVD and CD authoring and have never ( yes , never ) encountered a problem with them . And you can usually find them on sale !  
  The on / off switch is stuck . I cannot therefore record or review tapes . I pried the switch and made a temporary contact and confirmed that the camera can record and play-back I would like to be able to return it for full credit or have it repaired .  
  For $ 13 I cannot think of a better investment to your Nikon inventory . Slim , easy , and works great . No more running into the shot and trying to compose yourself with less than 1 second to go . Uses : - Spares you from racing into a photo - Easily capture multiple frames from a distance - Avoid any camera shake during long exposures .  
  Media code is MCC 01RG20 , which is Mitsubish Chemicals Corporation . They have an excellent reputation , which is why I was so surprised that this media is as bad as it is . I 'm using a Plextor PX-708A with the 1.08 firmware revision . The first 4X burn produced a coaster with tons of bad sectors , and visible dye damage . The second at 4X also had visible dye damage , but my recorder was able to read each sector . My Sony DVD player ( older and picky ) couldn't read it . A 2X burn produced something my DVD player could handle ( at least the title screen comes up , and the titles start playing - haven't checked playability across the entire disc ) . There 's still visible dye damage , so I 'm skeptical . Having bought this media so I could burn at 4X to produce something my DVD player will like ( have to burn at 2.4X with my + R media to achieve that ) , I 'm quite disappointed with the results .  
  This is my first home laser printer , and I love it . First page out is very fast , as is print speed . Looks a lot better , in my mind , than the HP 1012 . Manual duplex is easy to do . Noise during printing seems quite acceptable . And apparently the toner cartrdiges are easy to refill . A few niggly things stop me from giving this 5 stars : - There 's a fairly loud fan hum for about 15 minutes after printing , as it cools down . Not outright noisy , but way noisier than the average computer , and annoying for anyone who tries to minimize noise . I find myself avoiding printing small jobs sometimes , in order to avoid the noise after printing .. ( The HP 1012 doesn't do this , as it 's fanless ; but apparently its print speed slows * way * down after ~ 50 pages , in order to avoid overheating . ) - I 'm very keen on double-sided printing , and this printer does it well . However , it always prompts me to turn over the paper ( or cancel duplex ) , even after printing a job of just one side . ' Twould be nice if it was smart enough to realize there 's no reason to turn over and run the page through the printer again .. Easy enough to hit Cancel , but still a minor annoyance , particularly when photocopying . - Large power draw immediately prior to printing causes house lights to flicker . Not too bad , but noticable .  
  Despite the reviews I decided to try it ( my luck ) out . The one I got had orange sticker with null modem printed on top . Guess what , it is just a mislabeled gender changer . I even checked with a multimeter . Do not waste your time on this unless you want a gender changer .  
  Despite advertised claims , I was unable to obtain drivers that would work on my Windows 7/64 laptop . Trendnet support was awful . I 've included quotes from two emails from ' tech support ' . Their initial response was " We just tested the installation on a Win7 64 system and had no issues using the CD that came with the unit . " . When I asked for more detail to try to resolve it they replied " Unfortunately , we cannot troubleshoot you computer or OS . " That was the final reply . I tried the CD , downloaded drivers from Trendnet and from Prolific . The hardware itself was not defective ( tested it on XP sp3 ) . It and the drivers might work on some W7/64 machines ( per earlier reviews ) but not on all . I was fortunate in buying it through Amazon . The return / refund is already in process . I gave it 2 stars instead of 0 because it did work well on XP - just not on W7/64 .  
  Great product . The big CON is the Garmin policies about their databases and their _ very _ poor support . I bought a microSD City Navigator and I can't register it ( the site doesn't allow it ) and I can't backup it ( copying the files doesn't work ) . The Garmin support gave me at least 10 different answers about this but no solution for the problem . If I lose the chip or it gets damaged ( as happened a few months ago with another chip ) I will have nothing . Also _ very _ bad is the fact that you can not update any info in the card . And there are many small errors ( things are constantly changing ! ) . - The compass and altimeter have to be calibrated to be reliable . - The unit is not water proof and doesn't floatIf you 're not considering using Garmin maps / cityNavigators , it 's a very good choice . If you need Garmin 's maps / cityNavigators , prepare youself to be frustated with very bad support and many small errors that you can not fix .  
  Despite the rave reviews for this product , I 'm a bit more skeptical . I recently purchased an HP LaserJet 3015 MFC and wanted to use this device to connect to our office network . A couple of thoughts : 1 . Toms Networking does a comparison between this product and Silex 's SLX SX1000U . I would strongly suggest anyone thinking about buying this product to read the article . The article can be found at :[ .. ] 2 . Although Silex 's product only has one USB port , you * can * connect a USB hub to support up to 15 devices . The KeySpan device supports 4 devices , but you cannot add more devices . 3 . I found that the unit would experience problems if I submitted a print job greater than 7 MB through the KeySpan . I reset the printer and nothing got fixed . Only when I power cycled the KeySpan did things work . I am using the latest version , v1.3.1 , which also upgrades the KeySpan firmware . 4 . Toms Hardware also reports that it would crash with several different devices . I read on other web sites that the Keyspan software causes the blue screen of death ( IRQ_LESS_THAN_EQUAL errors ) , so I tend to believe that the problem is caused more by the Keyspan drivers than the HP ones . 5 . In some parts of its web site , KeySpan advertises that this unit supports USB v2.0 , but if you read the fine print it 's supporting at USB v1.1 speeds . 6 . I discussed with KeySpan about connecting external hard drives . This unit is really meant for multi-function printers and cannot support external HD 's . 7 . I decided to return this product and try out the Silex instead . Although there is a lot of potential for this device , I would not suggest it for enterprise environments . I read the glowing Amazon reviews but would put more skepticism about their comments now that I have tried it for myself . 8 . I will update this review later when I have a chance to try the Silex unit .  
  Microsoft did a great job with this webcam . Video quality is great and it works well in low lighting . My favorite thing of all is that the webcams design allows it to basically sit on any type of LCD monitor imagineable . I just switched from a 20 " to a 22 " and it fits no problem . Love it .  
  My son put this memory card in a full Sansa Fuze and got an error message . I learned that it shouldn't be added to the devise when completely full . After searching online using the error message " Not enough space for music DB , Free 90 MB " , I found the following solution " right click on it in Windows Explorer , and choose Format " . I connected it to my computer , opened the file and did that . It erased the whole devise , and he had to just reload the songs , and now works fine .  
  Got the usual excellent turnaround from Adorams ( 3 days ) . Remote is exactly what it says . Works great out of the box . Easy to keep in pocket for use when needed . Only down side is that it is so compact it would be easy to misplace ( not unlike the SD memory cards ) . It does have a little carry case , so that helps . Can't beat this for the money . I 'm surprised there are much more expensive remotes listed for the camera . Can't see what the use would be . Highly recommended .  
  great backpack , holds one camera with attachments well , if you need to put in a second camera it needs to have a small lens , or remove it and use a cap . would buy another if i needed it  
  this backpack is so amazing my son uses it for school . it fits all his class books notebook and it has a special place for your laptop to keep it steady this is the best 80 dollars i have spent on a backpack its very helpful and you can use it for like 2 to 3 years its wonderful .  
  How many of these little ear things have we all bought and lost ? Where do they all go ? I was a little wary of this brand , but they actually have great sound and bass response compared to others . I 'm going to buy some for my ungrateful children . It is possible they may like them .  
  If you don't want to spend $ 80 or more on the professional-grade stuff , this backpack serves the amateur very well . Plenty of room & dividers for your gear , and two outside pockets for stowing your favorite lens ( or water bottles ) .  
  A while ago I purchased the same item , maybe a month , and I received what I paid for : 2 walkie talkies , 2 RECHARGABLE BATTERIES , and a CHARGING BASE for the walkies . In this last purchase I thought I bought the same things , I even paid the same amount of money , but neither the batteries nor the charging came in the package . Thank youHumberto GonzalezSan Jose , Costa Rica  
  Nice for the wireless home w / more than one computer . I have three wireless computer on a N network . Once I did get the install disk to work the rest was easy and everything prints from the network .  
  Maybe I 'm a printer-holic : I have an Epson Photo R200 for photos . I have a Primera Signature Z6 for CDs ( fantastic printer , by the way ) . But I needed a fast , reliable printer for handouts and training materials . I work in Illustrator and InDesign , and PostScript Level 3 was critical . This printer is genuine Adobe PostScript ( not " PretendScript " like other printers ) , and it shows . But , beyond that , the entire experience is superior : the manufacturing standards are splendid ( great fit and finish ! ) , and the set-up guide is perfect-you can't go wrong . The little ink sticks are shape-coated so that even a trained squirrel could load them . The " walk-up installation " that finds Windows boxes and says " hello " automatically is wonderful . It 's speedy , sharp and chock full of great features I didn't know I 'd love . I highly recommend this printer !  
  My 80 year old mom , deaf in one ear , swears by it . She no longer has to keep the tv cranked up to ear-splitting volume . The neighbors are grateful , too .  
  I received these headphones as a birthday gift . I am a dedicated ( but slow ) runner , who likes to listen to podcasts or music while I run . I am on my second shuffle , but I 've gone through a couple dozen pair of headphones . I normally buy cheap headphones , and the wire wears out after 20-40 times running with them . So far , I 've run ten times with these cordless headphones . The volume control is a bit cumbersome with the way the shuffle is situated in the headphones , and I usually wear a headband to keep the headphones from jostling or slipping while I run . Other than those two minor complaints , I am competely satisfied with the product . I 'm hopeful that since the shuffle plugs directly into the headphones , I won't be constantly replacing headphones because of wear with the wiring . I really like them , I think they are a fantastic idea . I 'm hopeful they will last for at least a year or two . I think that $ 50.00 may be a little steep for what the product is , but I believe the price will gradually slide as other manufacturers make a similar product . One other downside .. I feel like Lobot , Lando Calrissian 's sidekick from The Empire Strikes Back when I wear these headphones . :-)  
  I really like this product because I raise dogs and I can put each dog on with different colored disks and just look for the color and its easier to find instead of looking and looking through all my black floppies to find the right one . Thanks again , Karon  
  I bought this about a year and a half ago when I picked up my V710 Motorola . at the time , it was difficult to find this memory , and 128 was the largest I found that wasn't backordered . now , they go all the way to 1gb and cost the same price as mine did . And it has reportedly been renamed micro SD . Anyhow , unfortunate for me , the v710 was one step below a phone that could play music from the memory card , although I can store songs and play them one by one from it .. which is incovenient . Reportedly with the V815 you can , and of course the newer multimedia Krazors and Razors can . But , I use it for my camera feature , and it works great to store the pictures and quick video clips that the phone can record as well . I am just amazed at the size of the card . It does come with an SD card addapter , which makes it a snap to transfer pictures to the computer with a card reader .. save buying the Expensive motorola software kit and transfer cables . 128mb is more than enough for my phone , but you can go larger . Sandisk make a great product . Check this out .  
  It didn't last as long as my other ones have . For the price , it lasted long enough - over a year . Wish they had this is a wider variety of colors though .  
  I have speakers on my porch and speakers in the house . This switch allows me to listen only in the house , only on the porch , or all at once . Istalled in a standard wall electrical box which allowed me to conceal all the speaker wires inside the wall . And it was cheap !  
  Good quality cable , ends are securely connected through rubber boots . Keeps the weather out . One downside , the cable is LMR-200 and not LMR-240 . A little bigger cable would have less loss but at 26ft its not too much of an issue .  
  This works wonderfully ! Even driving through cities I still get great reception and the fact that it charges it a huge bonus considering the new ipods do not come with chargers .  
  I like the earbud travel case - it keeps my earbuds from getting tangled and crushed . It 's sorta bulky given the inside space , but it still works well .  
  I bought this bag mainly because me and my family go on many day hikes so the idea of a photo backback was appealing . It 's got plenty of storage for various lenses / filters and whatnot . One thing that really stands out is how well it does on a run through the woods . I 'm sure most people wouldn't run with an SLR on their backs , but it does a great job keeping the camera stabilized as well as light-weight on your back . Also , I can't stress enough how nice it is to not have to take the lens off before storing the camera . Hope that helps !  
  Only rated 1 star because -5 is not an option ! Received these for Christmas - absolutely disappointed . These are headphones that a Dollar Store should be ashamed to sell . I have owned ( and also sold ) Sennheiser products for the last 30 years and been completely satisfied - which makes these pieces of crap even more disturbing . Also disturbing is the fact these are made in China for most likely less than $ 3 , and sold for well over $ 100 trading on the Sennheiser reputation . Following are observations : The manual - nothing on the base / transmitter / charger works as described - probably a bad English translation from a Chinese writer who never even saw the headphones . Also featured - NO CONTACT INFO of any kind - no support number , but then again , if I sold crap like this for so much , I wouldn't want to talk to customers either ! Design - no stereo balance adjustment , no manual tuning adjustment , cheap on / off switch - feels like it 'll break tomorrow .. insufficient volume control ; non-breathable ear cuffs - be prepared to sweat under there ! Sound Quality - NONE - will not function without the " surround " feature on ( why even have a switch ? ) - you can't provide enough signal to drive it with a computer sound card , powered speakers , or component stereo system .. and with ' surround ' on the bass is extremely exaggerated ( sounds like one of those mini cars with the 5000 watt stereo and subwoofer with the windows rolled up and 20 feet away from you at a traffic light ) . This combines with a S / N ratio of what must be 2 and cutting out of one or both earpieces , ( and an annoying ' whoosh whoosh whoosh ' as you move or turn your head .. RANGE : extremely limited - less than 10 feet without even more cutting out and noise ( as a matter of fact , cutting out LESS THAN 4 FEET from the transmitter ( directly under it , down 1 floor ) . With this kind of range , what 's the point of wireless ? 15 years ago I owned a pair of $ 60 Recotons ( no longer available ) that were better designed ( receiver allowed ANY headphones to be plugged in , 100 ft + range , and NO signal quality problems , with sufficient volume range ) that outperformed this by 10,000 to 1 . I 've seen the other reviews , and I realize there must be something awfully wrong with this particular set , but with no contact info how do I proceed to fix it ? And how will you ? Are you willing to chance spending over $ 100 and get something THAT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL ? And what , send it back for exchange and get another piece of junk ? I will certainly pursue satisfaction for this outrageous ripoff . And if I get it , I 'll change the review , but for now it stands on my experience with the product . Recommendation : don't even consider buying this crap .  
  I keep this on the side of my shower , so I will admit it has not gotten splashed much with water , but it seems to hold up well to the humidity . The sound is really impressive , loud and audible . Pretty easy to set up as well .  
  This Canon camera bag is a great fit for my digital Rebel , two lenses , two filters in individual cases , extra batteries and media cards , and even my personal GPS unit - and there 's plenty of space for it all ! Outside pockets allow me to carry my battery charger , a mini tripod , and even the camera manual with room left over ! I 'm so glad I purchased this camera bag !  
  if you have an iPod mini , or a 4G or up iPod , then you will be wondering , Why should i get this ? well , you shouldnt because this product is mainly made for 3G iPods , becasue the third generation iPod doesnt charge via USB , for it does the exact opposite , sucks the life out of your iPod . this lets you do what all the latest iPods can do , if you are a windows user , charges your iPod while conected to your computer . the only users who whould need this is for people with an unpowered usb port , for the latest iPods .  
  I read alot of reviews about Wireless headphones before deciding on the Sennheiser RS130 's . I realized there does not seem to be a specific brand that has the ' perfect ' headphones i.e. no complaints . What kind of expectations do we have from sound ? Well , I am a photographer & do not know much about sound ( although in very aspect of my life I am extremely pedantic & perfectionistic ) . My husband is a presenter for ESPN and obviously is around Sennheiser products all the time . My sister & her husband are both sound engineers ( they bought a cheaper variety of Sony 's ) . Ok , so after doing research I decided on the Sennheisers but they were over my aloted X-mas budget . Found a site on amazon that had a better price & seemed to have reasonably good seller reviews . Noise complaint : After fully charging them & plugging them in I tested with TV / Source sound very high & headset lower VERSUS TV / Source sound lower & headset higher & understood what people were complaining about . There is more noise when TV / Source sound is low . Noise / buzzing is far less when source sound is higher to start with . But still not perfect . Then next thing that lessened noise was placement of charger / transmitter . I just moved it away from the side of the TV that had more walls / obstructions & other wireless modems etc . Better again . But for you people that expect crystal clear sound you will be disappointed as there is a very , very slight buzz / rumble but for us it is nothing to complain about . The sound is great , they autotune , very comfortable fit , clicks easily into the recharging cradle & sound is pretty great !  
  I really enjoy this product . Very well made and display is very clear . Easy to use and great value for the money . The thing I like the most is the sound quality . It is just great ! The WOW option to enhance the sound is very good and the subwoofer control as well . The only thing I miss is an USB entry in the front panel , but for the rest it is perfect .  
  Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player ( Brown ) I bought a 30G Zune a year ago and loved the way I could have my music , pictures and videos with me always . I am a mother of 4 and a grandma of eight so I have LOTS of pics and flicks . I have about 1900 songs , 40 videos , and 212 pictures on my Zune right now with 14G to go . Two other family members bought Zunes through the year and it made it so nice to wirelessly share pictures with each other that I bought three more this Christmas as gifts for my husband , son , and sister . We are now a 6 Zune family and growing . We all love them and plan on buying more as the grandkids get older .  
  I have been looking for a case to fit my 10.0 " Insignia Portable DVD Player ( Insignia is the Best Buy Brand ) . Strangely enough , Best Buy did not sell a case that fit this player , so I had to look elsewhere . My local Target and Walmart cases did not fit ( the DVD cases were too small and the laptop computer cases were too big ) . This case fits my player perfectly ! There is even a little bit of room to spare , but not much . The case has two compartments : 1 side for the DVD player and 1 side for DVDs and cords . I have not tried to mount this in the car since this isn't the reason I bought the case ( but might be a nice perk ) . Overall , I 'm very satisfied .  
  I bought this lens after returning the canon 75-300 that I was very unhappy with . This lens has impressed me every step of the way and yielded some excellent images . I highly recommend it . and if your on the fence like I was trying to decide if you need the IS or not . Just do it . you wont be sorry , My only regret was wasting my time with the non IS version . Click order and enjoy . You will thank me .  
  The batteries worked for several months as backups to my canon battery . They were left in between projects for several months , now they will barely hold a charge . Use at your own discretion .  
  I purchased this card with teh Linksys 4port wireless router . I 'm running latest version of Win XP and I have broadband internet . This card installed easily , connects easily and performs like a charm in every room of the house . This card perfoms better than I expected . I also purchased the D-Link 650 + 22Mpbs - this card paoles next to the Netgear card . I recommend this to anmyone looking for simple set up and reliable performance .  
  I had a laptop which required me to remove the CD if I wanted a 3.5 inch floppy drive . What a pain ! This external floppy drive pluges into the USB port and I was fully functioanl using CD and floppy drive functions without the cumbersome effort to switch bays . Worked smoothly . Well worth the money the first day .  
  The carrying case was a little smaller then I expected but other then that it 's fine . It was well worth the cost .  
  I cant rate the battery quality . I only used it for about a month now and it seems working fine . Its a standard size ( RBC-7 ) so it fits perfect . Replacement is very easy . Did not find ony cheapper than Amazon .  
  I bought this new , over 3yrs ago , for around $ 69 , and it has served me quite well . I don't need to do a great deal of faxing , but it does the job , prints fine ( I don't use it to print pics ) , copies great , & scans ok , too . I order replacement ink from a third party company , saving almost 80 % from the retail cost , and it 's been fine , too . All in all , I couldn't much ask for anything more . If I did a tremendous amount of printing , I 'd probably go laser , & I wanted to print lots of pics , I 'd most certainly step up to something else , but for what this unit does , I 'm quite satisfied . And when I 've had any questions , they have been very good about support ..  
  I read a lot of bad reviews before I bought it , but it works great . Sure if you dont know much about mp3 players it may take some getting used to but works great .  
  I bought this charger along with a PowerEx MH-C9000 charger expecting to play with them both and pick a winner . Although the Ansmann Energy 8 is about as far from the PowerEx as two devices can be , I have to admit that I do like them both . I 'm not going to say this is the best charger ever , because it is good for some types of people and usage , but not all . If you like simplicity then this is the charger for you . Each batter position has a red / green LED and that is the full status you get . Overall , it can display charging , refreshing , done , and bad battery . That 's it . There is no doubt that this charger generally does a good job under most conditions , but I take away one star because the info it gives you is so limited and because it offers absolutely no control . Its this 5 % of problem conditions that gives me some doubts that this charger is not perfect . Here are two examples . First a put a PowerGenix NiZn battery in this charger . These are pretty common and similar to NiMH but with a higher 1.6v voltage . I put them in my PowerEx charger and they register an error in a few seconds . The Ansmann acts like its charging it , but goes through a continuous charge and refreshing cycle which repeats over and over . True the charger never claims to charge these , but its easy to tell these aren't NiMH batteries by their higher voltage , so I feel they should be rejected as bad . The second questionable problem was what I observed with several NiMH batteries . This charger displays a red , yellow , or green indication of battery charge for 5 second when a battery is inserted . This indicates under 25 % charge , 25-80 % , and 100 % respectively . This is a nice feature , but on many occasions I have inserted a battery , gotten a yellow light indicating 25-80 % , then , within 30 seconds to a minute the ready light turns on . How can that be ? A partially charged battery can not fully charge in a minute . Impossible . I 've also seen many cases where I 've had a charging and fully charged battery next to each other , I remove the charged battery and the charging battery suddenly indicates its charged . I 've seen it occur too many times to beleive its just a coincidence . In any case these problems are minor , and in most cases , the charger seems to work great . Of course those cheapie chargers you get with a pack of batteries seem to work well as well , but I do expect more from a charger which costs much more . Still if you don't mind spending the bucks , and you want simple , this charger is great and fairly quick . The PowerEx charger is fantastic as well , and if you are willing to spend the time with it you will get even better results , but you just can't pop in the batteries and walk away , and some PowerEx modes can take up to 48 hours to complete , and to be honest , for slightly better results the time may not be worth it . Oh , one more thing . This is certainly NOT a travel charger . Its rather large , but it uses a cord and not a wall wart , which is nice . And the users guide could be better . But overall I 'm very happy with this charger , and the fact that my wife can use it with no training , is a big plus .  
  I have filled this puppy up to capacity and i love it . Really good construction , durable , and the handle is really rugged but still aesthetically pleasing .  
  Nice picture , you forget its a small screen after using it for a little while . We have five of these and there isn't a single problem with any of them , I do wish they would have come with the audio cords too , but they are being using in a library so no big loss there .  
  this is great seller with good product and prompt shipping and will order from them again . headphones used for my laptop for noise blockage while listening to voices while watching video or movies . good headphones . most small headphines cannot get good connection at jack . this one works great .  
  Works great , no problems at all . Also looks and feels like a quality product . Wish I bought two !  
  I was looking for a cheap yet good quality FireWire card for a work PC , since I work with video , I needed a card that could download DV footage to the PC . This fit the bill perfectly . I was worried at getting a cheap one since it could potentially cause system instability ( anything you add to a PC can ) , but this one had plenty of positive reviews , so I figured I 'd take the plunge . I popped it into a free PCI port , started up Windows 7 , and it was instantly recognized as a 1394 compliant device , drivers installed right away , and that was it . No need for a disk , just plug and play . The device functions as it should , have had it for a couple months now , and no issues whatsoever . In case you 're unfamiliar , the instructions are included and actually pretty decently written , although it is a pretty quick procedure . Windows XP and up should automatically recognize and install drivers for it , so you shouldn't need a disk , just plug-n-play .  
  Perfect bag for your Bounty Hunter Metal Dectector . I was able to add another coil and a book and digging tools with no problem .  
  I have only had my Nano for a few days , but I LOVE it ! My boyfriend got it for my for my b-day and loved it so much he got himself one ! I was so amazed with the small size and how incredibly light weight it is . So far I have about 700 songs downloaded onto it . I recommend getting the car stereo adaptor which I have and it is amazing ! Now , one reviewer said something about the Nano being flimsy and it will break if you drop it . Obviously you need to take care of this device and if you 're clumsy and drop it then you deserve to have it break . As for the scratches on the screen , I have not removed the protective plastic that is on my Nano to protect it from well scratches . If you have removed that protective plastic , simply go to Radioshack or another electronics store and ask for PDA protectors . They come in sheets of 4 and you can cut them to if the Nano screen and vioila ! Insta-scratch protector ! Like I said , I have only had mine for 5 days but so far I am in love !  
  The garmin works well at navigating directions . If you should alter your course it will tell you all the directions you will need to get to your destination . I do like the not having to look at the map while driving to unknown places . The only cons I have had was loosing satellite signal during a heavy rainstorm and when there is a temperature change on the windshield the suction cup has come loose . Overall I do like this product but has a few flaws .

  I am using this to feed video to an LCD projector . I was afraid that the picture quality would suffer , but no worries . It looks great . Vibrant colors and no noise . I am not using the audio , so I cannot comment on that . One complaint , though . If you are in the habit of using premium cables you 're out of luck here . The plastic molding on the external case of these units is so close to the outside of the RCA jacks that there is no room for the thicker connectors found on high-end cables . The unit comes with two video / audio cables of the standard variety , and they fit fine . I wish I could use premium cables .  
  I read a lot of good reviews for this unit and decided to get one for my self . At first , I liked it ' cause of its compact , easy to use , and good price . But after a week using it , it started locking up and freeze the screen . I could not reset or turn off the unit at all . The only way to get it reset is wait for the battery to run out . It locked up every time I used after that . I 'm returnning it now . I bought this unit from outpost . com and I don't know whether they just only sell defected units over there .  
  I bought this about a year ago and it worked well until my apartment building had an actual power surge-then , not so well . In my apartment , ever electric item that was plugged in and NOT on a powersurge protector was completely fried . My computer equipment , which was on a regular $ 8 surge protector was fine ( although the surge protector was destroyed ) . Now , my TV equipment ( Wii , stereo , playstation , etc ) was not as good and this was on the Smart Strip . Although all appliances were off at the time of the surge , but television still made a popping sound and started to smoke . It is burned out . Most of the other appliances seem okay , but it is hard to check them when your apartment is being rewired and I don't have a TV to check it all . They all turn on , but the DVD player seems to overheat quickly . If you want to be eco-friendly and save energy , buy a regular powerstrip and just turn it off when you aren't using it . At least you won't have to put all your equipment in a landfill when your electricity has a freak problem !  
  The mount arrived today and .. MADE IN CHINA . Please be aware that the design of the product is good . It indeed installs quite easily in my corner configuration and it can support the 55 in television fine . But for this price , the last thing I expected was a marginal product in a damaged drop-shipped box made out of that cheap cardboard from a low-cost Chinese manufacturing plant . The quality of the mount is very questionable - they clearly used heavy gauge metal and the articulating joints are quality made , but the remainder is exactly what you are thinking of when you imagine something manufactured inexpensively in China . For instance , the tilt adjustment knob was stripped right out of the box . On a $ 600 piece of equipment I expect them to at least put a person at the end of the assembly line checking for defective product , this is ridiculous . The lateral rotation is mickey-mouse as well , a single pot-metal bolt " bearing . " The frame was misassembled out of the box , luckily I checked for plumb before drilling holes or the bottom bolts would have missed the studs . I shouldn't have to rebuild a product right out of the factory packaging like I did . It wobbles and clanks when moved around so I don't do it . Basically it is equivalent to a mount that costs 1/3 the price . I wish I had put a 2x8 across the corner and purchased a cheap flat mount from a box store instead . I didn't know that " high-end " mounts have such ghastly quality . I guess no one makes anything better so save your money and buy a cheap one , this is one case where it actually IS the same thing .  
  The seller was supposed to have sold me the Energy 8 charger , but sent me the Energy 8 PLUS which is a slightly different model . They expect me to return their mistake at my expense .. not happy at all . As far as the product , it works ok as long as you make sure that the neg / pos connections are completely connected since there is room for error . It has also given me an error on a battery , but after moving it into another slot , it worked fine ..  
  This thing is made so cheaply that it broke the second time I tried to use it . When I first pulled it out of the package , I knew it probably wouldn't last long . It felt sort of thin and fragile . If you decide to purchase this , do not attempt to use the headphone jack to plug in your phone or MP3 player . The part that you plug into broke off inside the device , which then shorted something out so that it doesn't work even if I use the card slot or USB . I know it was inexpensive but I thought I would get to use it more than once . Very disappointing , to say the least .  
  I read the reviews and bought one anyway , which was my mistake . It was brand new and like the review said the volume cut out completely at low settings . Never mind the possibility of the batteries leaking the sound from this unit is way too bright ; meaning it has far too much treble . The button functions also do not make sense . Buy a Logitech Pure-Fi Anywhere ( I did ) or an Altec Lansing IM9 .  
  I bought this for the main double din outer plate to go around my Pioneer AVIC Z2 . Apparently it doesn't come with that part . It is designed for putting a single din stereo into a double din compartment . It is not designed for putting a double din stereo into a double din compartment .  
  I purchased this modem it was a hunk of junk the tech support was no help . I was not happy with the quality of this modem .  
  Performance of the one I bought is pretty good . But I encountered couple of problems : 1 . The hand rest surface ( and most of the outer surface ) is coated with a fine porous silver color material . After about 2 months of use , the silver color of the hand touching areas changed to dark gray getting closer to light black ( may be this porous coating reacts with sweat ) . Now the laptop is about 8 months old and very ugly looking because of the big dark gray spots here and there . And they won't go away even though I tried to clean . Given that I am used to travel with the laptop , this does not please me . 2 . And in a place near the space tab , the coating just went away showing the underneath white color plastic like material . 3 . Couple of days ago , two keys stopped working ( Left CTRL key and the one with tidle ) . But I guess this is common in all laptops . I am yet to get this fixed . For about 3 years in the past , I was using a black color Dell Latitude C600 . I didn't encounter problems like this and it worked very well . Even though the speed was around 850MHz , my Linux installation was performing fast ( It was faster than an HP Presario 2500 with a 2.6 GHz Celeron processor - I ran some benchmark tests )  
  I bought a TeraStation Pro ( TS-2.0TGL / R5 ) in August 2006 . Jeremy at Buffalo Technology assured me that it would be compatible with the Mac operating system . I own a small graphic design studio and though that the server would stave off worries of running out of space for at least 7 years . When I received it I connected it to my LAN , but couldn't see the drive . What Jeremy didn't tell me was that it has to be configured with a Windoze PC . That was NOT compatible in my book . So I had a friend ( a SAN support technician ) configure it as RAID-5 , and reconnected it to my LAN . It worked fine for a few months , alternately accepting and not accepting Mac files , just long enough to be out of warranty when it started really misbehaving . The server was sluggish from the day it was plugged in , accepting data when it wanted to . Now every time I try to write to it , one of the four drives " goes bad " and it starts beeping . Constantly . So I called my friend to make whatever adjustment he does , and it worked for a while . As a final blow , the network connection no longer works . The server has been off-line more that it has been on-line and now it looks to be a permanent doorstop . My purchase of the TeraStation Pro was the worst $ 1,800 purchase I have ever made . I feel that I was led down the wrong road by Buffalo . I will never buy another Buffalo product .  
  I ordered and paid for a new unit . The recorder was dirty and dented and came in an old , beat-up box . The remote control didn't work . The supplier didn't have a replacement remote so he is going to send me a universal remote . I hope it works with the recorder . I have puchased quite a few large electronics from Amazon and this is the first time I 've had a problem . I guess it 's because it was an outside supplier .  
  When they work , they work fine . Successful burns of video files and home movies play well on my stand-alone DVD player , which is what I wanted these blank DVD + R discs for . But approximately half of them fail to write the lead-out , leaving them unusable . All of a sudden the great deal when buying in bulk isn't such a great deal when you 're throwing half of them in the trash . I won't make the mistake of buying this brand again just because of a lower price . I haven't used a lot of brands , but I have had much better success with Verbatim DVD-R discs .  
  I am not reviewing how this works b / c i am sure it works as well as all other ipods but .. i am shocked how expensive it is for a 4gb player . I know its an ipod so it will be expensive but you can get a 20gb player ( non-ipod ) for about the same price , maybe a little more . It is clear that you are not paying for gbs here but style . I understand that but it still seems like a high price to pay for fashion . I just want to listen to music !  
  This antenna doesn't provide an adequate signal ; it is less than half as effective compared to the pair of rabbit ears that I had lying around the house .  
  voice quality is very poor as all is garbled - that is if you can get it to record anything at all ..  
  The description of this product states that it will work with Windows 2000 . It does not . Even after contacting the vendor , who said it would work with Service Pack 4 installed on Windows 2000 . It does not , it won't even install itself . Very poor product , don't waste your money .  
  I do not recommend this player . Within a couple months it broke to the point where it will not even recognize any DVDs that are put into the player . The warranty is awful considering I have to pay shipping both to and back from the company . At which point I would be paying as much money as I paid for the player itself . Basically it 's wasted money .  
  I think maybe I 'm having a bad experience with WRT54GS because I 'm using both XP and OS X. Every other day , the router stop responding , then I can't even connect to the router until I reset it . I upgraded the firmware to the latest , 1.50.9 released 10/1/06 . It worked fine for a couple of weeks , then my mac mini couldn't get any DHCP assigned , even it was connected with Ethernet . This is a known problem , but Linksys hasn't been updated their firmware , and the user can't download older version of firmware from their site . I didn't see Apple OS X as one of supported OS , so I guess it 's not a Linksys ' fault . But if you 're using an OS X , you should avoid this router .  
  I took it back after a few minutes . For a cam that costs $ 50 , both the SOUND and VIDEO quality was terrible and grainy . I installed it correctly and I use Windows XP . Should have no problem but it was a major disappointment . .. the CREATIVE LIVE ! CAM which was only $ 29 works a LOT better . Bottom line-Mcrosoft LifeCam VX-3000 has both BAD PICTURES , and BAD SOUND . You have been warned .  
  I purchased this router for a relative of mine . I recently opened the package to find that I received a USED router . There were scratches on the top of the router and the " install the software first warning sticker " that normally is covering the ports was off and stuck to the inside of the product literature . Someone also had scribbled on the product literature with a black permanent marker . I am not happy about this . I expect more from Amazon and Linksys . I 'm guessing I received a return , refurb , or something along those lines . A new item does not look like this . This is the second time in a few months this has happened to me with a purchase coming directly from Amazon . The first issue was with a computer subwoofer from Logitech that had a large scuff mark on the top of it . My guess is someone was resting their shoes on it . It is very noticeable .  
  The DV5500 is a piece of garbage _ the day I got it it wouldn't focus right and I called for help and they told me I was shaking and that 's why pictures weren't clear , I used the tripod and took a video and it did improve somewhat , I put the camera in it 's docking station and about 5 months later tried to use it again and found out it WAS NOT FOCUSING AT ALL so I called them again , the FIRST thing they asked was WHEN I bought it and since it was over a year , they said it was OUT OF WARRANTY and they DID NOT FIX any out of warrantry cameras , in other words THROW it AWAY because no one else does either . I wouldn't buy another MUSTEK product if they gave it away  
  Bought this printer in April . Probably printed 20 pages on it in 3 months since I have another printer hooked up . When it worked it printed great pictures . Ink cartridges ran run out too quickly though . In July it died . Got a " paper jam " error without any paper in it . Contacted HP service , which is overseas in Asia now . Mostly the rep read off what you can find on their web page . Most of the time I couldn't understand him anyway . It wasted 1 hr until they agreed to send a remanufactured one to replace the broken printer . 10 days later , the replacement showed up . All was well until the next morning . The color cartridge has some kind of leaked and I needed to run the clean cycle a few time to get it to print in color every time the printer sat for more than 12 hrs . With how little ink is in the HP 95 , this was a problem . So I called them again this time I spoke to a supervisor . They sent another remanufactured printer . 10 days later is showed up . And guess what , it doesn't work . The second replacement will not power up . This was after the supervisor said he would make sure QA double checked the printer before it went out .. Currently I 'm working with a case manager ( one step higher than a supervisor ) , who is not very helpfully . It 's been three days and still no solution . I originally bought a C4150 , and they sent a c4180 . Seems like there are a lot of broken 4180s . If they send back a 4150 , I 'll return it and get my money back and buy a Canon . Its too bad , my old HP printer is 7 yrs old and working great . I wanted an all in one to clear up some space ..  
  There 's absolutely no reason to pay $ 27 for 100 bags , when you can just use the cheap clear plastic office wastebasket liners ( 7 to 10 gallon ) that sell for $ 18 for * 500 * at Costco , Sam 's Club , etc . I just finished a major shredding job with my Fellowes DMC12 , and used many of those .  
  DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE ! This mouse has given me nothing but frustration . 1 . The front of the mouse where the buttons are located is extremely low , causing a muscle strain in your hand if you use it for long periods of time . 2 . Battery life is horrible . Like 2 weeks .. 3 . When your mouse is idle for 8 minutes , it goes into an automatic sleep mode . The manual says to touch the metal lines on the side to " revive " it but when I do it simply freeze the cursor on the screen . So I have to reboot my computer . Absolutely the worst !  
  The JVC DF420AU D-VHS tape does exactly what it proposes : given a properly set up D-VHS VCR , it makes perfect pixel by pixel copies of HDTV . I cannot see any difference between live and recorded high definition TV when I use these and a firewire connection with my HM-DH40000 . You can also tape SVHS or VHS formats on this tape , and those formats come out quite nicely as well . However , the quiet secret here is that the formulation here is essentially identical to high quality S-VHS tape - at 4 times the price . The only difference is that rather than having a single hole in the chassis this tape has a second , allowing the VCR to read it as a D-VHS tape rather than a S-VHS tape . There is an obvious workaround to this that can be found fairly easily on the web ; search if you 're interested . From my experience S-VHS tapes with the workaround work just as well as this far more expensive tape , which is why I knock off two stars , and a third for a price gouging at 1.5 times the already outrageously expensive 150 minute D-VHS DF300AU . I can't guarantee S-VHS tapes will last as long , but then again , since there 's no warranty on the D-VHS tapes either there doesn't seem to be much risk . I also haven't been able to tell any difference between the JVC and Maxwell DVHS versions , which is unsurprising . Data recording - which is all D-VHS really is - either records data or it doesn't . Cheaper tapes definitely will have drop outs , but quality tapes won't . One further note . There are still a few 3 hour SVHS tapes available at half the cost of this from dealers , which would be my recommendation if you need to archive long sagas like the LOTR movies , Saving Private Ryan , or the Deer Hunter when they show up on premium cable HDTV . Short of archiving sports directly from a tuner instead of a PVR , there 's not much that can't fit on a 3 hour tape instead of the much more expensive 3.5 hour version sold here .  
  I bought 2 of these battery and 1 the them will only be good for 1 hour of shooting . Disappointed .  
  I 've had these in my ears for under 10 minutes , and they 've already fallen out three or four times . I should mention that I am sitting in a chair and not moving . Sound quality is sub-par , although for $ 2 I wasn't expecting greatness ( and I 'm sure I would eventually get used to it ) . I was hoping to have these as a cheap backup , but they 're almost unusable . Try something else .  
  Save yourself $ 10 and buy a jar of mayonnaise , you 'll get the same results smearing that all over your screen . Guess I shouldn't be surprised buying a product from a company known for selling ( scamming ) overpriced " premium " audio cables . A one star review is the lowest you can give . It 's also generous for this product .  
  I looked forward to getting Energizer-branded batteries for my Nikon camera , so I bought three of these batteries . But , they aren't Energizer . They 're made by a company called Technuity and are licensed under the Energizer brand . After a few uses , they quickly died out either refusing to take a charge , or taking a charge but running dead within minutes of starting to use them . If you want a quality battery , find one made by Nikon .  
  The capture software , Ad FullCap , requires a serial number different from the product ID # in order to open and run it . That number is not supplied in some packages , and you must e-mail tech support and wait for them to e-mail you back the number . Had there been any notice of this requirement , I would have e-mailed them before I wanted to capture video , instead of wasting the weekend I 'd cleared to do the the project .  
  The only decent thing about this mic is that it looks alright and is easy to use . However , I usually had to keep the mic directly next to my mouth in order to be heard and the quality wasn't that great . The base of it is also very light so it moves around easily and often tips over . I 'd highly suggest the Logitech USB Desktop Mic , which I 've also used , and is much better for less than $ 10 more .  
  This player is the worst for the following reasons : 1 . Slow to start . 2 . No bookmark / audio resume feature3 . Do not play files by foler order . I have 10 folders , each has mp3 files named 1 . mp3 , 2 . mp3 , etc without albums or artist info . And I can't play them by the folder order . 4 . It supports FAT32 , but guess what , pop in a FAT32 4G SD , and it doesn't work5 . Amazon do not take mp3 player return  
  My daughter received this for her birthday last year . It seemed perfect for her pink room and light use . It has been 14 months and the bulb is going out . I would recommend buying a brand name television that will last and skip the cutsey . Very dissapointing .  
  I bought this unit to track how far I travel while walking . Thefirst unit received had bad segments in the LCD . Amazonquickly sent another unit that did appear to work . This unit takes a long time to find sattelites . Several timesit never found ANY , under clear blue sky . It just turned offafter 10 minutes . It would lose signal frequently . The deal breaker is that when it loses sattelites , it will not accountfor distance during the lost signal . Lets say you are walking / running , and the unit is logging distance . For a 10th of a mile , it losessattelite . When it gets sattelite back , it starts loggingagain from the new point . But it does NOT add the distanceyou traveled while the signal was missing . As if I teleportedto the new location . Useless .  
  This printer has been an absolute nightmare . We wanted an all in one so we wouldn't have so many machines in our office . Well when you try to print something it stops halfway and you can't get it to finish printing without shutting down your pc and the printer and rebooting everything . This might work if you 're lucky . We 've called HP several times to no avail . They seem to have no idea what the problem is because they 've had us try all sorts of nonsence that doesn't work . They were absolutely no help . I could get a realiable printer for the fraction of the cost and that 's what I intend to do . We 've stuck with this printer for so long because of the cost , but I just can't take it anymore .  
  Router was an acceptable product for just over one year . One and one-half months after the warranty expires , so does this router . I took pains to avoid Netgear in the replacement of the product . Maybe you should too .  
  As of the day I bought this , early February , 2010 , the Amazon blurb said " The Back-UPS CS provides professional-grade power protection for office and home office systems . " and " These features along with its classic styling make the Back-UPS CS a perfect choice for protecting your important office and home office systems . " Lulled by this assurance , I did not realize that 230V is not just a harmless part of the name like BK500 or 500VA or even 300W . So I ordered and upon delivery found reference in the literature to " Valid in Australia only " . What ? They have 240 Volt power . I am in the US ! So right before wrecking my computer , I checked again . To my surprise , some companies use 220 to 260 volt office equipment in North America and some ship to foreign subsidiaries . So " 230 volt " is sold for use here and for export , but average Amazon customers here should be EXPLICITLY WARNED and not misled . Back it goes and the vendor charges a restocking fee plus I pay shipping both ways . Oh , the joy of buying on the internet . Pitfalls abound , even with legitimate retailers . It 's easy to say " You should have known that 230V means 240 volts before you bought it . " Well , it did not occur to me at the time and I am annoyed by the careless , deceptive blurb . This product is not made for North American home office systems . Amazon 's description is wrong and misleading . At least I did not destroy my computer . Thank you for nothing , Amazon !  
  The package did not appear to have been damaged , but the end cap was cracked and it cannot be used . Unfortunately , the time to return has expired . I don't know if I can find parts . I don't want to have to buy another one .  
  I bought many sets for my speelites and noticed they didnt hold a charge very long . I bought the la crosse charger which test batteries and they tested between 60 and 1500 mah and they claim to be 2700 . these batteries should be taken off the market ! the only cool thing about the company was that they refunded me my money .  
  I bought this tripod with the intention of using it for both still photography and video . Its head is truly fluid moving , unlike many other tripods on the market . However , the pluses end there . The construction is rather flimsy , and is not best suited for outdoor conditions . Do not use this tripod for still photographs ; one cannot rotate the head vertically , extremely limiting is usefulness . As a matter of fact , after about a month of ownership , one of the rubber pegs on the leg fell off , and now it does not attach on securely . Not only that though , is that the grip that allows you to move the head fell off , rendering the tripod useless . For $ 85 there are many more higher quality tripods that I would have bought . This tripod in reality is worth about $ 35 . I will return this product , expect a refund , and go visit a real camera store to actually try out the tripod before purchasing online .  
  I was putting this together when the antenna just broke off . They have the antennas swivel heads on so tight that they easily just snap off . This also has a huge clumsy AC plug which is unnecessary and a waste of precious plug space . When I returned this to the store , I saw another person retuning this exact same model also . GE has a much better model that I bought instead that doesn't break and doesn't have any AC plug which works wonderfully . Don't waste your money on this RCA antenna . I give it ZERO stars .  
  This thing gets 2 stars only because it does what it claims and allows me to talk to people without pulling my SE530s out ( Anyone that owns a pair can tell you what a hassle this is , especially once you get accustomed to wearing them properly ) . Beyond serving its intended function , I find it very hard to reccommend this item bacuse of several truly baffling design decisions . A ) It is HUGE . I cannot see any reason why this device needs to be the size and shape of some sort of bizzare egg case . There is no technology inside the thing that calls for it to be much larger than the average hands-free device you might use with your cell phone . Their decision to power it with an alkaline battery seems to be the culprit here . B ) The clip on back stinks and is not reversable . It is pretty clear that the intent was that this thing be worn on your belt . Well , I use mine at the office and turn it on when I get up to get copies or something , or when someone comes in to bother me at my desk . Unless someone is going to bend over and talk into my belt , having it down there is pretty counter-productive . Since I work in an office where I have to wear ID around my neck all the time , I like to hang it on the lanyard that holds my ID . WHOOPS ! The clip is BACKWARDS for that ! I ended up pulling the pins off of one of those cubicle wall clips and supergluing that to the back of my PTH . That works , but really looks ghetto when added to the already clunky dimentions of this thing . Why not just give it a clip that has grip ? Dunno . Baffling . C ) Battery door latch stinks . It falls open ALL THE TIME and mine couldn't be any more gently used . D ) U-shaped cable orientation is just dumb . Why not make it an inline sort of thing ? Why not put the 3.5mm jack in the device itself ? It is truly baffling . This thing does what it is supposed to , but there MUST be a better option . Whoever made this thing really could have used a few more industrial design courses . The horrible design of this is made even more baffling by the contrast to the superb , and very attractive SE 530s . I just don't get it .  
  I totally agree with the reviewer from Harrisburg , Pa ( June 24 ) . The SonyDCRHC40 that I purchased from Best Buy had too much motor noise for my liking . Of course , the motor noise occurs when a tape is in the camcorder and is recording or playing . It was my luck that the camcorders at Best Buy were locked where the tape goes in for security reasons and when I turned on each of the Sony camcorders without a tape in them , there was no noise . So I bought the SonyDCRHC40 . When I began taping a dance recital the noise was terrible . I was charged a restocking fee to return that camcorder and then told that ALL camcorders make the motor noise . Well , I am now trying a tape in each camcorder I look at and there are camcorders that do not make the noise that came out of the Sony . So , buyers beware . Try the camcorder with a tape in it before you make the purchase .  
  I 've had this mouse for about 4 years , so this isn't a deal breaker or anything , but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to someone else . The right side slopes outward slightly , rather than inward , so it 's very comfortable to hold , but when you have to pick the mouse up to re-center it on your desk / mouse pad , those two fingers on the right side are going to slip off . And that 'll go on for awhile until you can teach yourself how to grip it properly in order to pick it up , and even though you 'll eventually get the hang of it , it 'll never be a comfortable / natural movement . Also the positioning of the 2 thumb buttons are off . The " back " button is about where the " forward " button should be , and the " forward " button by the thumb is too far forward , so you have to readjust your grip just to click it , which makes it a lot less convenient than just finding the " forward " button on your browser & clicking that instead . So that button doesn't get much use . But on the plus side , the sensitivity is great , the mousewheel is smooth & silent , I use the " burst fire " option once in awhile , so it 's a nice feature to have available .  
  My daughter received this camera as a gift . Koday Easyshare was supposed to be so great , but I don't agree . I am not a novice at taking pictures and have taken many great pictures with my Canon Powershot . The Kodak camera eats up batteries like mad . There is a delay between pressing the button and when the camera actually snaps the picture , which has resulted in many missed shots . It is very sensitive to motion and pictures come out blurry . On top of that the software that you use to download pictures ( and you need the software to download , unlike the Canon ) is a memory hog and bogs down my computer ( 2 different versions installed on two computers ) . Other than the camera being lightweight , I don't have anything good to say about it . I realize this is an older model now ( not when we received it ) , but it 's only two years old and I 'm ready to pitch it because it is so frustrating to use .  
  Horrible product . Owned the Surge protector for about a month , then started to hear a sizzling noise . Thank goodness my laptop was not plugged in at the time . Never ever buying a Belkin product again !  
  HP 935 not worth it . Please read . Despite all of the many , many flaws of this 5.3 mega pixel camera , it still serves a purpose . If you are seriously considering this camera - please read on , and be careful how you spend your money ! ~ THE BAD ~ - Very slow in many respects ! - Very slow read and write times to / from the memory card . - Slow at taking pictures . - Very slow on start-up . - Not very accurate colour reproduction on professionally printed prints . - Colour tones seem muted or slightly washed out - Battery life very low . Way below average . - 7x digital zoom awful . You can't tell what you 're taking a picture of ; it 's so small on the screen . - 5.3 megapixels does not make more detailed pictures . Only larger ones . For more detail , go with interlaced digicams . - Flash effective for only half the distance it should be for . - Software glitches - CCD is obvously low quality : too much " noise " in pictures . ~ THE GOOD ~ - 5.3 megapixels make for huge pictures . If you need them . - Pentax lens . - Lots of picture-taking options . ~ THE STORY ~ one of my buddies has a Sony 3.2 mp camera which takes far superior pictures in almost every respect . The colours are more vivid and more accurate . The 5.3 mp of the HP 935 only makes a larger picture , because , once you 've reached " Photograph Quality " prints , you can't get any clearer unless you buy an interlaced digital camera . We both had our pictures printed at the same professional photo booth . The result ? All of our pals who saw our pictures agree that hers are better . And , sadly , I would have to agree as well . ~ OTHER CAMERAS ~ This is a sub-par camera not to be taken seriously . Even 3.2 megapixel Sony cameras take way better pictures than this HP.I suspect that you 'll get even better results with a modern 2.0 or 2.1 mp camera , by almost any other company . Consider anything BUT this camera , unless you enjoy wasting money . * ~ THE END ~ Overall - HP has a long way to go before they 'll be taken seriously in the camera world . Given the chance again , I would not buy this camera . Image quality is sub-par . Colour is sub-accurate . Price is too steep for what it is . If this camera cost $ 200 ( Canadian ) it would be fantastic . Because that 's what it should be worth . Bottom line is : This is a joke of a camera .  
  This is the first pair of decent headphones I bought , and the first pair that cost more than $ 20 . Let me first say that upgrading from earbuds to these is an eye-opening experience . However , two pairs have broken over the past year . Unfortunately , they offer no warranty of any kind . The first pair started crackling a lot , and eventually it would only work if you held the cable a certain way near the end . Since I liked the quality , I decided to buy another pair in case the first one was just defective . On this pair , the left ear just stopped working suddenly . I take very good care of my things ( especially expensive things ) , and have no idea why two pairs broke . I now have to wait a few days for some Sennheiser HD202s to be shipped to me , since I believe they will be of better sound quality anyway . There are a few other problems as well : The cord is extremely short , which makes it difficult to use when doing anything other than sitting at home listening to music . These headphones have another interesting problem . They don't play very loud , so even with my volume all the way up , I still had to strain to hear certain things . However , these also leak . A lot . So when I 'm riding the L or in an elevator , or anywhere where I 'm not alone , I have to turn down the music . And then I can't hear it very well ( at least not well enough to appreciate the sound quality ) . I also plug this into my amp sometimes , and I have to turn the volume on my guitar and the amp all the way up just to get loud enough to drown out the sound of the strings ( when I 'm playing with distortion ) . I really can't justify this purchase . I guess it introduced me to good sound quality and made me enjoy music much more since I could hear it , but the negatives far outweigh the positives , and I would not recommend these headphones to anyone , especially not for the price .  
  Just recently got a U150 error : " Cartridge not recognized by printer " This follows on the heels of error indicating that I had two of the same print cartridges in the machine several months ago . I have never bought anything but genuine Canon ink . So , maybe there is a defect in the cartridge and the little " keep the user only buying from us " chip . BUT , all I wanted to do was scan an item , NOT PRINT . However the people who designed the software for this thing in their infinite wisdom chose to DISABLE ALL FUNCTIONS if all cartridges are not in the printer , filled with ink and recognizable . So you must at all times keep backups of ALL cartridges in case of the day when your cartridges become unrecognizable to the machine even though the are the correct cartridge in the correct position and filled with ink . You cannot scan or fax without a full complement of cartridges . Maybe the next version will work in a sane logical manner and allow non-printing related functions to work . Until that day I will not be buying another Canon printer . The reason for buying a multifunction printer is so that each function can work independently and not be dependent on the ink supply .  
  From the reviews provided by GPSer , C320 looks like a perfect machine with reasonable price , but now the price got up more than $ 150 now at Amazon . com . Personally , I think it is not a good time to buy this unit now , maybe after the new type of the Garmin unit comes out with reasonable prices . I will wait .  
  I was originally looking at a pair of in-ear headphones with a head-band for use in working out and ended up with these by mistake . Overall sound quality is average to good with noteworthy enhancement in Bass response and the obvious sound isolation you would expect from an in-ear sealed design . Not on par with Sure or other higher end models . Physical design is disappointing . They don't feel particularly secure in my ears even with the smaller silicone inserted ( BTW I am 6'2 " ) , and for reasons known only to Sony and some Asian design engineers hopped on a coffee and Sake buzz , the earphone cords are of an un-even length which places all of the hanging-pressure of the headphones on only one ear , making them more likely to pull out . The cord is also quite short ( less than two feet ) and will not allow you to hang a music player off your beltline without the additional extension cord they provided . I can see the logic process here was geared towards people using the player around their neck or arm perhaps ? But the poor / uneven cord design coupled with the extension cord makes using the extension cord an unpleasant experience . Overall I 'd say if you are stationary this weird design would be acceptable but not optimal , if you are walking aruond at all ( what a crazy idea for PORTABLE music player ) , it is not acceptable at all .. For that reason I cannot recommend this pair of headphones ..  
  I purchased the MN-500 Wireless Base Station last May and it worked great all summer . In fact , it is the simplest router I have ever used . Setup was simple , quick , and it enabled all the security features automatically , as opposed to using default settings that are easily compromised . However , after three months of using this device , it simply stopped working . The lights did not blink ; they all just stayed lit . Technical support was very helpful and sent me a replacement promptly and I was just as pleased with the new unit . Suspiciously enough , this same problem occurred a mere three months later . I will not comment on the technical support the second time around , but they sent me a new router , anyway . The third MN-500 I received was the new and improved version of the product , released with the same features as the MN-700 Wireless Base Station sans wireless-G capabilities . In other words , it was now using a " Commercial-Grade SPI Firewall . " To say the least , the new MN-500 not only had the same capabilities as all the other MN-500 Wireless Base Stations I had received , but it was in fact , the SAME router . It did not have any of the additional enhancements that were listed on the box and it used the same firmware version as the previous models . I saw nothing in the router configuration concerning control of the firewall by any means different than was previously available . My understanding ( in dealing with LINKSYS products ) is that a Stateful Packet Inspection ( SPI ) Firewall gives you more control over incoming packets than the choice to simply enable or disable the firewall , which is the only choice given for the MN-500 . Even when I updated the firmware , I still saw no change to this feature and was very disappointed that it did not give me more advanced controls over my Internet connection . On the bright side , the base station has given me strong wireless connections and I have never received a drop-off in communication between any wired or wireless device with this product . Nevertheless , this product needed to be replaced twice and does not have any of the features a computer user might want . I turned to the WRV-54G Wireless VPN Broadband Router from LINKSYS , and despite its poor remarks here at Amazon . com , I have never had a single problem . ( Please note that I update all my firmware promptly upon each release . )  
  I have been using Verbatim Lightscribe disk for about a year with no problems at all . Unfortunatly that is not the case with this batch . Every disk fails when burning to them unless I burn at 4X speed or slower . When at 4X I only had about a 50 % fail rate . I had purchased a total of 60 disk and had over 40 fail .  
  these headphones were great at first , but then failed ( right ear stopped working ) after 3 months . I sent the orginal pair back to the manufacturer for a replacement , but the replacement pair also failed with the same problem after a couple more months . Stay away from these .  
  I ordered laminating pouches , and I received laminating sheets instead . I am very disappointed .  
  In 9 months , I have gone through 6 pairs of these headphones . They were a gift , so I could only exchange them . The sound is decent , but the build quality is awful . The problem has been the same on every pair - after a month or so , one ear phone would be barely audible while the other plays fine . Sony had better come up with a solution . A lot of people have had the same problems , and Sony won't own up to it and fix it . Since 1 pair hasn't lasted over 2 months , I would recommend staying away from these headphones until Sony corrects their issues .  
  Well , I thought I couldn't go wrong giving this cable a try since it is so inexpensive and I am still glad I did so , because now I know what I do now . And that is ; Price really does matter . I received this cable and it is much worse due to artifacts then my component cables . There are large white / black diamonds and blocks ( several pixels ) every few seconds that appear randomly all over my screen for split seconds . HDMI is digital so I figured it is either on or off . Correct , but there still can be interference , and the single may get messed up , and this creates artifacts . Anyways , if you have any doubts it really doesn't hurt to try these cheap cables . But for people who don't want to waste the time , just go with expensive well made cables .  
  Yes this printer is pretty cheap and prints well , and the ink cartridges are cheap . That said , I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone because the ink runs out really really fast . The cartridges it takes only hold 10ml of ink ( most hold at least 17ml and some out there hold up to 50ml ) and won't print more than 250 pages of text .  
  What 's in this , about 1 oz of ink ? You go through these like bottled water . I guess its obvious why Epson doesn't have clear ink containers like the knock offs - you'ld see it was almost empty when you bought it .  
  I do not understand how someone has not taken action against Sony for this product . If there 's a laywer out there in search for a class action , they should look into this . I am using a GRV550 right now and this is the third time I start writing a review .. it shut down twice in less than an hour ! Besides that major flaw , this machine is extremely noisy and it gets extremely hot . If you take those three into account , you rule out 99 % of the settings where a laptop would be of any use . I contacted their customer support a couple of times and they were helplessly hopeless - or hopelessly helpless .. They basically ask you to reset the bios . They obviously already know this thing is a lemon so they will just make you waste some time . I would gladly return this piece of plastic if I could . Won't be getting any more Sony during this lifetime for sure !  
  I would not recommend this printer . Print quality is poor and the ink cartridges are expensive .  
  I returned my Tivoli PAL for the following reasons : 1 ) I wasn't blown away by the sound . I recently bought a Boston Acoustics Receptor Radio and was much more impressed with the boomy presence of that small radio . The PAL sounded much thinner . I 've read criticims of " too much bass " from the BA radio , so obviously it 's a matter of opinion . 2 ) Lack of features . No HD radio . Mono ( not a huge issue for me , actually ) . No alarm , digital readout , memory presets ( obviously ) . No switch to aux so I 'd have to plug / unplug the line everytime I wasn't to make the switch to / from my iPod . 3 ) I didn't plan to take advantage of its portability . I planned to leave this in my office , so one of the main advantages of this radio would be wasted . Returning this radio was not an easy decision because it is very cute and gets very good reception . I knew it lacked many features when I bought it . The main reason I returned it was because it lacked the rich , deep , room-filling sound I had hoped for . In the end , I just didn't think it was worth the $ 149 I paid for it . Now it 's $ 199 ? I think they used to be $ 99 . Isn't technology supposed to get cheaper over time ? There are a lot of 5 star reviews , so I 'm in the minority here . I 'd suggest listening to it before purchase if possible .  
  Linksys changed the configuration of this bridge completely from one that requires an adapter at one end to a stand alone unit without changing the model number . The only tip-off is that they have added etherfast 10/100 to the name of the model . Hence , when my order for the new PREBR10 arrived and I ripped into it ( I know , I know ) I found that I had the older model . The spec sheet for the 10/100 sheet claims that the bridge , connected directly to the router , rather than to the modem , will deliver up to 100mbps , the way I read it . And , the way I read it , it does not need an adapter at the other end . After you have programmed it into your router , you unplug from the router and into your ethernet port and you 're ready to go . So , I was cheated by Linksys not changing the model number when they drastically changed this model . I don't have the energy , am not angry enough , to try to get anything done about this . ( And of course , recourse through the retailer is closed because of my haste . ) But , this is the last Linksys product I will buy . Besides their product support stinks . I once had a defective router right out of the box and they absolutely refused to help me . Luckily the retailer took it back .  
  On the HP Photo Value Pack , the package states 24 cents per photo . The package includes 150 sheets of photo paper . 24 cents x 150 sheets equals $ 36.00As I write this , the price above is listed as : List Price : $ 47.15Price : $ 35.99You Save : $ 11.16 ( 24 %) The " list price " of 47.15 would not add up to . 24 cents per photo ! I always understood the list price to be set by the manufacturer ( HP ) , which in this case would not match the promotional packaging ( also HP ) The Amazon " sale " price of 35.99 , should be the list price . I hope this is not deception on the part of Amazon . ~ ~ ~ I have found that these HP Photo Value Packs are subject to some deceptive marketing on the web because buyers understandably think that they are getting standard volume ink cartridges in the deal . Also on a popular auction site , The HP Photo Value Packs are opened , and the 150 sheets of photo paper , and ink cartridge sets sold separately . So although they are genuine HP ink , some believe that they are buying standard full cartridges . The ink in the HP Photo Value Packs are " custom " cartridges , meaning they are filled with only enough ink to print 150 photos . The standard HP individual cartridge ( from the HP website ) : HP 02 Light Cyan Ink Cartridge ( C8774WN # 140 ) , andHP 02 Light Magenta Ink Print Cartridge ( C8775WN # 140 ) , are listed at 240 photos . So without the original box , you can not easily know if you are buying a much lower volume of ink . Beware of sellers ~ Amazon or auctions who may let you believe that the ink tanks you are buying are the standard full ones . Here is a clue to watch for in auctions where sellers have the unboxed ( but individually sealed ) sets of ink : The sets from opened HP Photo Value Packs will have 6 tanks . If Black is included in the set , ask questions , it may be from a HP Photo Value Pack . Black is often sold separately , for example , 5 tanks in this HP Combo Pack : HP 02 Inkjet Print Cartridge Color Combo Pack ( CC604FN # 140 ) ~ John  
  I bought this Zune for each one of my children ( basically I bought 2 ) because they were on super sale before christmas and I was able to get it for 79.99 which I thought was a great price . The screen was great , the music quality was good , and they loved the option to listen to the radio . However 2 months after christmas the Zunes quit charging no matter where I tried to plug them in I brought them to work I tried all 3 pc 's at my house , it was a nightmare . Then when I finally got my sons charged and tried to play it it completely froze . Never did get my daughters charged . So I called microsoft and spoke to a representative in there help center . After a 45 minute call where he had me do everything I had done at least 10 times before . He agreed to send me the packages to send them back to be fixed or replaced . I sent the Zunes back in the pre-paid fed-ex packages they sent about a month ago and have heard nothing since . So I will be calling them soon . But for others I would definetely suggest another route as this product just didn't last even for the price I paid it wasn't worth it .  
  This drive worked beutifully in the first 6 months in on of our school research laboratories , regardless of the infrequent unexplained miscommunication with the PC . After they trusted it for work and research data backup , done just once every 2 weeks , it suddenly gave clicking sounds and stopped working . After extended agony with the customer support , they simply got nothing . Surperisingly , when they talked about this subject with some of our collegues in our University , they discovered that many of us , in defferent departments , suffered from the same problem with different models of the Wistern Digital external hard drives ( USB / Firewire ) . After all the frustration and the torture with this piece of junk , I can say for sure , Buy WD if you are looking for the best machine to lose your data ? Beleive me when I say Western Digital Hard Drives are absolutely the worst for your data storage . We 've been there before .  
  I really don't understand how anyone could possibly think that this is a good design . I considered buying this backpack and a similar one by Jeep , but quickly realized that it was guaranteed to break almost anything you could possibly carry in it other than clothing because of the single center bar . To demonstrate the problem , put a pencil against the corner of your kitchen counter . Press on both ends of the pencil . What happens ? The pencil breaks . The kitchen counter is acting as a fulcrum , the pencil as a lever with substantial force on both ends . In a similar fashion , when you put a book in this sort of backpack , everything else in the bag is pushing on both sides of that book , but the book is supported only in the center by that single vertical post . Unless you only carry light stuff in the bag , you 're almost guaranteed to end up with bent notebooks , books with broken backs , laptops with cracked screens , and so on . It 's quite possibly the worst backpack design mistake in the history of backpacks . If you don't care about the stuff you 're carrying , by all means , buy one of these . If what you are carrying has any value at all , do yourself a favor and buy something with a more traditional double handle or wait for the designers to come up with a single handle built into a solid back so that it doesn't turn your cargo into a lever with a heavy weight at both ends . There 's not enough crack in the world for this design to make sense .  
  I purchased this adapter to enable hook up of a scrolling sign . Cable does not recognize sign . After finding this out , I tried to remove software from my computer . It will not uninstall . Have tried everything to no avail .  
  I purchased this for my mother in law who could not hear the phone ring . The ringer does have a volume control as well as a slider on the side to adjust the tone but it is just not that loud . About as loud as a regular telephone ! I was looking for loud and just did not get it !  
  The photocyan cartridge ( BCI-6PC ) from onSale is not as advertised ( it is not a Canon product ) , does not work , and is pure junk . Beware .  
  I wanted to play my iPod tunes in my car . I had a cassette adapter but the quality was not satisfactory . I bought the Irock 300w thinking it would be better as there would not be the mechanical problem of cassette head alignment with the cassette adapter . It works . The sound comes through the radio on the tuned channel . The quality is not very good . The signal drops occasionally . I found improvement by moving the unit around the vehicle but since my car antenna is in the rear that is where it worked best . It is a little difficult to control the iPod when it is several feet behind you . It is also not convenient to run a cable back there to have the Irock closer to the antenna . I don't use it . I use the cassette adapter with its own poor sound quality problems .  
  I bought a QPS back in April , I had configuration issues right away . I followed the tech support format and emailed them . Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers . They do not respond through support . Now the hardware failed , I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes . No 1-800 number . Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also . Please don't allow companies like this to thrive , which they all too commonly do in todays market . Buy elsewhere .  
  This camera is such a waste .. normal use even delicate use , will break this camera . I have had an older HP for years that Ive never had an issue with , but for some reason I have needed 2 replacements sent to me , due to internal software issues , the camera freezing , etc . It is way too touchy . Also their customer support is outsourced and I have a hard time getting the people to understand my problems , and they wont repair the camera , just keep sending new ones to me . This is a limited edition item , is it just supposed to sit pretty on the shelf ? I never know if they are going to send me the same model since its pretty hard to find now . A waste of time and money .  
  I bought this because I wanted to hear stations in either Europe or the Middle East . I really can't hear any of those places . I heard Toronto , Mexico , one Asian country , and a French speaking station that wasn't come out clear enough . The AM and FM are very good , though . And it is a very small radio . But I am looking for a strong Shortwave at a bargain , and I didn't get that .  
  I was very disappointed with this item . The biggest problem that I had was that the CD pockets are actually NOT designed to let you hold the booklets as well - in fact , they didn't even fit into mine . So if you are planning to only carry 52 CDs , and keep the booklets , don't buy this case . Additionally , it did not feel very robust compared to other CD cases I have owned .  
  Worked fine when I first got it , the fan wasn't loud as other reviewers described and it was simple to put together . But the computer stopped recognizing the drive after 40 days , I swapped drives to ensure it wasn't the dvd-drive itself , but the enclosure wouldn't work with any drive I put in it . Unfortunately , it 's so cheap , it 's not even worth going to the manufacturer to warranty . Easier to pick up a new one ( not a Nexstar ) . Unfortunately , I can't recommend the brand or drive because it didn't even last one year .  
  I order this heart rate monitor for my forerunner 301 . It appeared to be brand new out of the packaging and I am sure it was , however , it does not work . It could be a dead battery , who knows , the bottom line is that it should have worked . Now I have this useless piece of equipment . I would buy a battery for it but I can't because I am in Afghanistan . The CR2032 battery required is not sold out here .  
  There is absolutely no way this product is for a s13 240sx . Ive tried cutting , sanding , molding .. Not for this car . Im not 100 percent sure but I think the Metra 99-7407 is the right din for the s13 's .  
  I bought a sharp lcd tv from j & r in new york last Jan , after a year and half , when powering on the tv , sometimes works , sometimes not . after unplug in , wait for a while and plug back , worked for a couple months . Send it to service center to checkup , was told that the lcd control board needs to be replaced . when request to get back the replaced lcd control board , was told that sharp does not give back the replaced board , it has to be shipped back , otherwise , you have to pay additional fee to get back the replaced board .. it 's rather strange to hear such a lousy policy from any vendor .. But , if you do want to get a sharp , better get a long long warranty ..  
  I had already sent this card back once as it had corrupted the images in my Digital Elph camera . I am not a professional photographer , but I did get a bit tired of waiting for the pictures to write to the card after taking photos . I would recommend a newer / faster card than this .  
  Trying to move some old files from my old G4 to my new MacBook , I was hoping an external zip drive would do the trick . Macs are supposed to have built in drivers for this unit , and it 's advertised to be compatible , but it didn't work and the seller - no surprise - wasn't willing to refund me . If you are a Mac user , I strongly suggest you investigate other options for transferring files .  
  This item produces a pleasant effect and adds very nice lighting to the party . It has good sound sensitivity . However , the cons outweigh : 1 . Duty cycle 10 min means you need to buy two and also automatic timer-switches for the outlets . That triples the cost at least . 2 . The damned thing heats like an iron - it is not safe , if within reach , especially if kids are around . 3 . It is 600W - probably more power than all your house lighting together . Count in the energy cost . 4 . The power cord is very short ( 3 ft ? ) , and there 's no on / off switch . So you will likely need extension cords with a switch too - or unplug the unit every time to switch it off . 5 . It is bulky : this mushroom is about 18 " tall and 12 " in diameter . After some research , I 've found there are many LED or laser lighting options under $ 100 , which are under 10W power consumption , have no duty cycle requirements , won't burn you . Chauvet min lasers will even fit in your pocket . So , from my point of view , this is an antiquated product .  
  Fell apart after first use . The soft part of the earpiece broke away from the hard plastic . Had to toss them . not word $ 15:99 il buy a diffrent one  
  Shredded paper goes in your recycle bin ; plastic bags do not . I had not thought of using a bag , but there are biodegradeable tall kitchen bags and smaller food waste bags that I guess could be used .  
  Worked for about two weeks then nothing . Checked both ends for good connection but still no power through it . Put my old one back on that I use on my motorcycle and device works fine . So I put the new back in and wiggled the plug end of the wire and was able to get power if I held the wire to one side . Junk !  
  I had purchased an earlier 64MB Rio , and loved it . So when I wanted more memory , I naturally tried another Rio . As soon as got my new Rio home , it didn't work . I exchanged it for another , and that one worked for three months , and then the volume button stopped working . If it weren't for these problems , I 'd rate it five stars . The controls are intuitive , and you can figure out everything without reading the manual . The only thin it lacks is the " pants clip " that the earlier Rio 64MB had - that is a lot more comfortable than the belt / arm device the new one has .  
  This device ( both models ) is a total piece of junk . Be warned . Do NOT purchase this piece of crap . It isn't worth anything unless you like frustration and an expensive paper weight . Look elsewhere .  
  Seldom use this webcam , picture and sound system is not too good . Next time I buy a computer I 'll get the one that has a build inwebcam .  
  I was just about to buy this piece of crap when I realized that there are other producers of mp3 's like Creative . The Creative MuVo TX FM has FM radio , a microphone , better battery life , and MOST IMPORTANTLY , HAS A SCREEN ! I feel sorry for all the ignorant fools who bought iPods when Creative Zens and MuVos are ten times better at the same price or less . I 'm definitely gonna buy a MuVo instead .  
  very cheap construction , doesn't hold camera unless you screw it in really tightly , which causes the tripod to fall apart . If that 's fine with you , then this tripod is great !  
  The cartridge was obviously leaky as soon as I opened the plastic wrapping . Fortunately I was in a position to wash my hands immediately , or I would have been stained for days . So I had to return it , and dealing with Amazon return is no fun . The return process is confusing at best . When I finally got to the part where I could ship via UPS , the program to pull up a list of local stations wasn't working . I will buy it locally from now on . At least then if there are problems I know where to go .  
  Easy to install , but after about 6 months it started only working intermittently . Finally broke around 7 months , hard drive would turn on but not be recognized in any computer I tried it in ( included ones that it worked in the day before ) . I got a silver one for a couple bucks so I guess you get what you pay for , but you are better off just buying a better one . Also the USB Type A as the connector for the hard drive is pretty stupid . Why not just use a miniUSB like every other external drive I have ever seen ?  
  The hood actually made it more difficult to see the LCD . It was much more effective to just turn so the LCD was in my own shadow . The rubber eye-cup fell off frequently . Eventually , after falling off three times over the course of one hour , I lost in it some tall grass .  
  This is a relatively inexpensive IP camera that works relatively well in the wired mode that is relatively new to the market . However , even with extensive help from Linksys / Cisco 's technical service I have been unable to get it to function in the wireless mode . As others have noted the color is poor . Read more .. Pros - This is an affordable IP camera that allows one to view from other computers if you use Linksys ' web-forwarding service or other services . - Pan / Tilt mechanism works though , as another reviewer points out , a little noisy . This may be good if you want to know if someone is using the camera . - There is a 2X zoom that may help is some cases but it is not much of a magnification - The color of the image suggests that it relies heavily on IR wavelengths so it may work in low light but I have not tried this yet . - There is an LCD panel on the front that allows one to check the unit 's IP address and whether it is static or dynamic . - The software permits an email alert if the image changes which functions as motion detector . - The software can ftp an still image to another site at regular intervals so that you can build a movie or update a viewing web page . - Setting up the camera in wired mode was straightforward . Cons - As others have noted the color is poor . Trees and grass register a reddish hue that suggests that the camera is heavily weighted toward the IR wavelengths . A replacement unit also had this problem so it is probably the default situation . - The image resolution is not crisp . - As another reviewer has noted the stand is flimsy and does not hold the camera securely , especially if the cable is stiff . - The major problem is that I have not been able to establish a wireless connection using my D-Link DI-642 wireless router . This has been noted by other reviewers . After with several interactions with Linksys / Cisco 's technical service the first unit was deemed defective and replaced ( shipping at my expense ) . The replacement unit also could not function wirelessly suggesting that the problems are inherent in the design . I will not list the steps that we tried to establish WiFi but they were extensive with both the initial unit and the replacement unit . Linksys / Cisco has again asked me to send the replacement unit in for another replacement . I am fairly proficient with wireless configurations so I should be able to configure this camera to work with my network . In summary , this camera has good potential but is plagued by problems that make it a disappointing product . I believe that this camera has a narrow window of compatibility and is not ready for the general consumer market . I 'm betting that these problems result from software issues that were not addressed before rollout . I can not recommend this camera . Please note that it is Linksys / Cisco 's policy that no refunds are given on returned equipment . This means that if you are not satisfied with its performance you have no recourse .  
  This work well , however they are still too big for my ears . One inevitably keeps popping out , which makes it difficult to keep it on my head . The sound quality and everything else is great , I just wish the ear buds were smaller .  
  I purchased this from a different online dealer that is has a very good reputation , but it was having light meter problems right out of the box and all of my negatives were either over / under exposed . To verify this , I took the camera with the 28-70 lens to a local camera repair shop and they verified my problems with the light meter and told me that the lens was underexposing as well . I tried to talk on the phone with the company that bought out vivitar but they wouldn't budge and kept me on hold for 40 min . Extremely rude customer service . When they came back they just kept telling me that they could do nothing even though I have a one year warrenty ! I finally got help through their email and sent everything back . Got a new camera and they fixed the lens ( maybe , I still think it is a little off ) free of charge . Avoid the hassle dont buy this camera kit . If you have the money get a nikon or canon , its a much safer bet even if used .  
  What a disappointment when Christmas morning my son started to set up the Ceiva 3 only to find that it would cost another 159.95 per year to make it work . We went back to the box looking in disbelief that we had missed this important information . BUT THE ADDITIONAL COST IS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND . It says " free " but no mention of the additional 99.95 to 159.95 needed to use their product . Such deception should not be allowed by companies who use Amazon to sell their products . We are sending this item back . If they deceived us once , how can they be trusted ? Shame on Ceiva ! I will never again fail to read the reviews BEFORE I BUY .  
  Got it at a great price . Liked it . Used it , didn't abuse it . But for whatever reason , it just stopped working - way too soon . Maybe I got the lemon , but I can't recommend it - wish I could - just like I wish this mouse lasted much longer before it failed !  
  Like many reviewers , my iPod Shuffle was defective out of the box . Naively , I spent hours loading and reloading , reseting , etc as laid out on the Apple website . I finally found a number for customer support and sent it back . I got no apology for the defective hardware . I was told that I should be happy that they were sending me a replacement as if the fact that the brand new one I bought being defective was somehow my fault . The replacement has worked fine so far . I am keeping my fingers crossed . I wish I had immediately sent it back instead of messing with it for hours . It was clearly bad hardwareIf you buy a Shuffle and have any issues with it , send it back right away ! Don't follow their directions thinking that there may be software problems that can fixed . These are made in China with evidently no quality control check . Some are just made wrong and will not work .  
  DON'T BUY ANY ZUNE / MICROSOFT PRODUCT ! I 'm still looking at a blank Zune screen and a worthless device because Microsoft refuses to admit there is a problem with Zune as of 12/31/08 . Don't trust Microsoft , and don't buy Zune unless you just want to throw your money away ! I 've never been a Mac person , but now it 's time to change !  
  I returned this product twice ; once for a replacement and the second time for a refund . My research pointed to this camera as being able to meet my needs , however it did not . One was a feature oriented problem , in that it took way too long to cycle between photos . I missed some really good memories at my son 's high school graduation because of that . More importantly , both cameras had lens problems that manifested in opaque circles showing up in photos that had a solid background . Sorry , but this camera just did not make the grade . I ended up with a Canon .  
  But I didn't give a s * , because I only paid 5 dollars for the card in the first place . The card works great in my GPS , I 'm just a little burnt over not getting the SD Adapter .  
  A word of caution , if I may . I 'm currently caught in theseventh circle of Gateway Customer Service Hell over anissue with my 400VTX laptop that is covered by warrantybut that the company refuses to repair . Their customerservice has been MONUMENTALLY bad , I 'm sorry to say . Before buying any Gateway product you might want toGoogle the words " gateway " and " sucks " . To date theyreturn over 800,000 results . Wow . Assuming as many ashalf don't have anything to do with the company ( a bigassumption ) , that leaves over 400,000 very unsatisfiedcustomers . Not a good sign . If you choose to go with Gateway please accept my mostheartfelt condolences .. and best of luck ! You 'll probablyneed it if something goes wrong with your purchase . As for me , soon I 'll be giving up on PCs altogether andswitching to a Mac . Sure , Steve Jobs is a jerk , but hiscompany makes beautiful , dependable machines . I hope ..  
  Maybe this lens is great , but Amazon does not indicate that the VAD-RA adaptor is needed to attach it - and that is currently unavailable .  
  I 'm sure this is a fine product , but it died in less than two weeks  
  I loved it when it worked : great features , no problems with WMA , good battery life ( though not as good as advertised ) . But after a couple of months it became prone to freezing when reading MP3 and WMA files , which became increasingly worse over time , and now it won't even read factory-pressed CDs . The disc just spins and spins , trying to boot up but failing . I didn't drop it or abuse it in any way . This is a huge disappointment .  
  I bought these earphones 10 months ago and loved them until this week . The sound quality is great , and they 're very comfortable , but they WILL disintegrate . The rubber on the cord has come off in two places , leaving the wires completely exposed . My right earbud has also begun to periodically stop working . Sometimes it 's fine , and other times I don't get any sound at all . It 's clearly dying a slow death and I expect it to stop working entirely eventually . For the price , you probably won't find a better sounding pair of earphones . If you 're looking for a pair that will actually hold up , however , look elsewhere . I 've got to buy a replacement pair of earbuds now to replace my broken Fontopias , and I definitely won't be buying these again .  
  Ditto stevec50 's comments . As an engineer , I couldn't get the device to work , either . To make matters worse , if you have your bidirectional printer switched " on " when you restart your machine , you get a Blue Screen . Belkin 's latest driver upgrade ( October 1999 ) does not resolve any problems ( even though the Readme text says it does ) , and their technical support is clueless . My recommendation is to find another route for your parallel devices , such as an A-B switch , an autoswitch , or by adding another ISA parallel port card . Beware of the latter , though . My new Micron Millennia Max 733 has no ISA slot ! ( I was told that is the way of the future - no ISA . )  
  When I bought this combo system I assumed that in exchange for convenience and space saving there would be some compromises . Unfortunately there are a little too many . First , the unit cannot play back MP3 CDs as advertised . It lost about half of the songs from each CD I tried , it broke individual songs into multiple files , it messed up directory structure - in short , forget about using it to playback your MP3 collection . It is clear that the MP3 functionality was tacked on as an afterthought - and not very well . Instructions regarding MP3 playback do not even appear in the ( indecipherable ) manual , but rather are found on an ( equally indecipherable ) piece of paper shipped with the unit . Since MP3 playback was a big selling point for me , I was rather disappointed . A second annoyance is that the remote control does not work with my new Toshiba TV . Nor does the Toshiba TV remote work with the VCR / DVD . This is just ridiculous . My main complaint however is that the unit simply stopped working 3 weeks after I bought it . The entire electrical system just shorted out - I couldn't even eject the tape and DVD that were in it . Amazingly , there is a Toshiba certified repair center nearby . They promise to have it fixed about 3 weeks . Great . Update - Two weeks later , I received a call from the Toshiba Authorized Service Center saying that they don't know how to fix the unit . I was told to call Toshiba customer support . Toshiba says they will looking it , but are non-commital doing anything .  
  We just bought this router , but we are Mac users and it only comes with a PC disc . A call to customer service didn't help . Can this be set up with a Mac ?  
  Hi i bought this webcam in brandsmart it cost me $ 20 when i got home i tried it everything was green so i thought of resarting my computer then i tried it again but nothing everything always came out black so plz dont waste $ 20 or $ 30 dollars on this !  
  I really wanted to like this mp3 player . I was trying to replace my 1G Shuffle , which has been kind physically contorted with superglue since the cheap Apple armband snapped off the USB connector . My main purpose : to use it at the gym and to be able to listen to some podcasts when I 'm walking around Downtown ( I was in Seattle at the time ) . I kept trying to defend its problems , but the last straw was when it broke in under 6 months . The right channel of sound just stopped working altogether . If I was an electrical engineer I might take it apart and try tightening whatever was loose to cause this problem , but I honestly didn't even feel that it was worth doing that . Let me list all the things I hated about it : -I 'll start with the issue of crashing . It crashed a few times a week . It would just be playing a song , and then it would freeze . Or it would be choppy in playing a track . That was especially irritating . - The navigation was completely unintuitive on it . It was not easy or enjoyable to move around in it or select tracks . - No one mentions this , but it 's a huge problem : you CANNOT make playlists on the computer ! I tried all sorts of things to try to make one and put it on there , but none of my attempts worked , and the manual only explains making playlists on the device . You have no idea how frustrating it is to have to make playlists for the gym on the device , which would take me at least 5-10 minutes for a 5 or 6 hour playlist . I much preferred using iTunes . - The radio receiver was really bad . I 'd have to be in the right place at the right time to get clear reception of anything . - The screen quality so not as good as it may appear in the pictures . Looking at photos on this thing is not worth trying . - If you stop listening to your playlist to just play normal music , it doesn't remember where you 're at . - It 's a little bigger than it looks , especially in a neoprene case for working out . - It didn't come with any special software , you just use Windows Media Player . - The battery life was not that great . It may have lasted 7-10 hours . My 1G Shuffle was a lot better than that . I really can't think of any reasons to get this device . The armband I bought from DLO for it worked a lot better than the Apple armband for my shuffle , but that 's about it . Even for just working out , this device isn't worth it . You could pay a few more bucks and get a 2G Shuffle if you 're looking for a low-end device ; the new one is actually easier for workouts .  
  First thing I did with this remote is to try to control my XBox 360 . Out of the package , this remote runs VERY slowly on the XBox 360 . You press a button , the control lights up , and then about a half second later the command registers with the XBox . . . As you press the buttons , your commands also seem to queue up . So you hit the button a few times while its waiting to register for the first command , it then does your repeat presses in the order you hit them . But wait , you can change the timings ! Everyone and their mother is telling me to change the timings but of course , timings are set to their minimum for the XBox . Then someone told me on the logitech forums that I have to aim it better . . . this is a remote control . I shouldnt have to do anything other than point in the basic direction . These people want me to install a lazer sight on the damned thing . The TV setup was somewhat of a pain . I had to erase my entire configuration in order to use it . Then when I set up the TV and Cable activities , it seemed to create all its own inputs with the default names . I don't like that at all . . . it should be able to use the inputs that I define so my wife who won't use this control doesn't have to memorize that the DTV input is cable and Component 1 is DVD . Next , I can't just power on and off the TV . I have to hit some other button that is asking what activity I 'd like to use first . When I do this , it makes sure all of inputs are correct . So because of this , it takes like 7 seconds for my TV to turn on when I tell it to use the " Watch TV " activity . I can't figure out how to tell it that these inputs that it is checking won't change . . . Not to mention that when I did this , it seems to blip inputs and add a space to a movie I 'm recording because inputs from the cable box were set in the process . All I want to do is hit the power button . - Buttons : First , there are missing buttons . Where is the " List " or " On Demand " button ? Where is the sleep button ? PIP buttons ? There are more but you get the picture . Page up / down ? Guide ( Guide and Live were an afterthought thrown as words on the buttons you might use for the A / B / C buttons . They don't even work as guide and Live until you program them if you want to ) . How about the A B C buttons that have been on every cable remote that I 've seen in the past 8 years ? For buttons that don't exist , you can put them into the 4 buttons with paging on the LCD screen . That 's nice , but should I have to page over for buttons ? Luckily I was able to fit my buttons on unused things such as sleep on Star . The Live button also didn't work out of the box but I was able to fix it . The configuration utility is pretty confusing at first but it was doable . There are typos but I assume that is the mistake of the TV manufacturer . The LCD is a nice feature but it needs more buttons . - Timing : Ugh . . . why do I care about timing ? WHY ? Why can the manufacturer not provide the timing ? Setting timings is what you have to do when your remote responds too slowly for your items . Unfortunately , Im stuck with a slow XBox remote . . . this is ridiculous but true . My TV Volume control was too slow at first but I lowered the timings and it works fine . . . My settings were arbitrary and they worked . Guess I can't complain about more than having to set them in the first place . - Software : The software does not provide much info . For instance . When I go to timings and I see the " Start Time " or whatever it is . . . I want to know what that means . Most people think mousing over something like that should tell me but apparently not the people at logitech . I still don't know what it means though I did finally find a way to get the manual which does not come with the remote ( this is a good idea though because I dont like all the paper wasted on manuals ) . - For the money , Im not sure I 'd buy this remote . I got it as a gift and I did want it but after seeing some of the things about it , I kinda wish I just waited on this and bought something a little more sophisticated and comprehensive . For those who don't know , you can use ANY harmony remote for the XBox 360 . You don't need this thing . There might be more about this but I didn't even finish setting up the system . It took me a few hours to get just my TV set up with all the buttons and timings I want . I had to finally go to sleep . Luckily my sleep key worked . I was happy about that .  
  They must b / c I don't know how they 're all so happy with it . I 'm not going to write a long diatribe here , but I want to caution potential buyers of the e270 . For starters , it 's NOT compatible with Napster To Go nor Y ! Music Unlimited To Go subscription-based services . It is compatible with Rhapsody , but set up is difficult and you MUST HAVE USB 2.0 on your computer . The MTC protocol ( see , I told you it is difficult . . . and I 'm not that technologically savvy ) only works with USB 2.0 , not 1.1 , which I have . Also , it scratches way easily . If you do purchase this product then get a cover for it . The controls are sluggish in terms of moving from one song to the next , but the scroll wheel is pretty cool . I also wish the sound output and the bass response were better . The bass is a little flat for my taste and when you 're in the gym or on a plane , you can hear all sorts of backround noise b / c it isn't loud enough . ( And yes , I went ahead and purchased the Shure earphones for $ 150 and I 'm still not pleased with the sound performance ) . I can't totally trash the player , although I 'm super dissapointed with it . . . especially in light of how much money I spent on it . Customer Support has been great . Quick and responsive . The player design is cool . It 's small , but not to tiny so that the controls are difficult to operate . The scroll wheel is cool and the graphic display is bright and cool looking . Overall , if you 're looking for a player that 's compatible with all of the music to go , subscription-based services , look further than the e270 . If you are cool with paying per song , go with the Nano and itunes . Oh , and who cares about the expansion slot . 6GBs are enough .  
  I 've become convinced there is a timer or expiration mechanism on the ink cartridge usage on this device . I didn't notice right away because I used the device a lot and it seemed OK . But my usage has waned and here is what happens : I replace all cartridges and print two pages . 3 months later I go to print 2 more pages and it claims the ink is half gone . 2 months later I print one more page and it claims the cartridges are empty and need to be replaced . 7 PAGES AND THE CARTRIDGES ARE EMPTY ! I ignore the empty warnings for another dozen pages or so before I break down and buy new cartridges . This is still terrible performance . I 've now read on other forums if you ignore the empty warnings long enough the whole device will lock up and become unusable . I will never buy another Canon product .  
  Nowhere on the item description does it say this product come 's with a foreign power transformer . There is no way to plug this adapter into a United States Spec Plug . False advertising , product does not work and was not sold as described . Went to store to purchase a universal adapter . When plugged in , this also did not work , meaning unit was dead and defective . Complete waste of time and money . Do yourself a favor and buy something else . Will be returning for refund .  
  Same as everyone .. pain in the butt to install . It managed to disable my wireless rather connecting it .. The tech support guy , clearly reading a computer screen somewhere in India , was clueless , a jerk on top of it , and rude .. Finally after getting it connected , it now drops the connection repeatedly just as advertised in the other reviews .. I should have listened ..  
  In an effort to save money I bought two of these . They look exactly like the real thing but they don't work like a real Canon battery . The batteries do work but it take some finessing . The one thing you loose is the battery strength meter on the camera . I may use these batteries in a pinch but you have no idea how long the battery will last . I wouldn't recommend these to anyone .  
  What a nightmare . I 'm going to declare it a national holiday when I return this item . Do a Google search online before you buy this item . You will see endless calls for help over missing drivers , challenges with installing software using XP , etc . I have considerable computer experience . Yet after I bought this All-in-One unit last weekend I spent 14 hours on the phone w / HP tech support and endless hours trying fixes of my own . They all gave me a different story . Then turned me over to the laptop division of HP saying it must be a problem w / my laptop . The laptop division , SURPRISE , sent me back to the printer division . I 've tried all the ' fixes ' , ordered a new installation disk , reintalled software many times , new USB cable . Nadda . Still junk . Save yourself the frustration . I am keeping my old ' print only ' printer . It 's plug and play . If you have Windows XP Professional , this unit will NOT necessarily be ' Plug and Play . ' Time to go give my old reliable printer a hug . The software , by the way , is a complete memory hog and takes forever to install .  
  I purchased this printer because it was one of the first to get Vista drivers . I wish I would have waited . I have no problem with the printer itself . Its fast , clear , good quality . The software is the worst and they wont update it . I used the printer first wirelessly and then with the ethernet . both were failures , The printer icons would disapear off multiple computers every few days requiring me to reinstall the software . Support wanted me to disable their own printer detection services . Which didn't help . I have 4 computers in my house and I have reinstalled the printer drivers over 40 times in 6 months . Dont buy this if you like doing this . HP support is the worst too . I didnt get help until I figured out the CEOs name and sent him a email directly . BTW Im installing the drivers again while I write this review .  
  See the reviews below . my 2500mAh NiMHs play for about 75 minutes per charge . Won't read multi-session CDs , and tech support doesn't know why . A / C adapter only works if the player is kept perfectly still , otherwise power is lost . From time to time stops playing for 5 seconds - 2 minutes in the middle of tracks . I have never been this disapointed in a consumer electronics product .  
  This product worked great for about a month , then it completely went dead , and was as worthless as the battery I replaced , giving you about 10 seconds before the machine totally shut off if you unplugged the AC . I called , and Tigerdirect said there was nothing they could do , but they instructed me on what to say to IBM Tech Support , regarding when I made the purchase and what not . The kicker is they wanted me to lie ! I stayed on the line while the TigerDirect person connected me with IBM , and made the introduction to the IBM Tech Support person , he gave them my laptop serial number , ( which should have nothing to do with warranty on an aftermarket battery ! ) and then turned it over to me , then dropped off the line ! I told the IBM person , who mind you knew everything about me from my serial number , that I was being asked to lie in order to cheat them out of a battery by a rep at TirgerDirect , I applogized on TigerDirect 's behalf and hung up . That was a $ 65 mistake !  
  Although a month and a spindle of disks have been trashed , I don't have it working yet . I 've just sent it back to ADS for repair . Seems that it starts okay in direct tape to disk but freezes on a video frame while the counter and audio continue working . At that time , the green capture light of the DX2 stops flashing and becomes steady and the DVD recorder stops burning . A program upgrade was installed , but the problem continued . Several calls to ADS Tech , when I could get them on the phone , offered the upgrade and blamed the problem on memory , but my 512 RAM had nothing else running except Norton Internet Security . So it went back for whatever ADS / Tech5 can find wrong with it . I haven't given up hope , yet !  
  Pluuged it in , working nice , transferred a couple gigs of video , unmounted , unplugged . It wouldn't turn on again . The moral of this story is to stick to known brands . Ugh .  
  I am no where close to an audiophile , nor am I generally critical of a product . I purchased these , and took them back almost immediately - something I almost never do . While comfortable enough , the sound quality on these was worse than the $ 2 headphones that I picked up on the airplane . When others say the bass isn't punchy , what they mean is that there 's no bass whatsoever . The product marketing suggests that it amplifies sounds important to gaming such as bullets and footsteps . Indeed it does . It ALSO greatly amplifies static , compression artifacts , and crackling noises . Everything sounded tinny and cheap , as if the speakers were actually broken . Secondly , the microphone is of terrible quality . Every word you speak into it is nestled comfortably in a thick , squishy pad of hissing noise . This hiss , incidentally , is amplified by the headphones if you hear your own feed . The microphone far too quiet , requiring either an uncomfortably loud speaking voice or an increase in microphone gain . The gain , of course , equally increases voice volume and the background hiss . I exchanged these for an equivalently priced set from Sennhauser ( pc 166 ) . In comparison , the new set sounds like perfection . Additionally , the microphone adds little to no background noise and clearly picks up even a whisper . I can adjust my soundcard 's equalizer if I wish to blast high end .  
  The item arrived in a separate metalic envelope without any instructions . I plugged it into my computer . My computer didn't recognize it . I tried to install it through control panel and my computer didn't recognize it there either . It may work at my work site because my computer is newer there , but who knows . I don't recommend to the average computer software user .  
  Just bought this but it 's over 30 days now . New TV with Netflix dingle still drops signal . Bought a new Mac Mini and after two days trying to connect to the net , an Apple wireless professional said these " G " routers are 4 year old technology . He thinks that G does not support the new Mac Mini or other new electronics very well . Now I have to go purchase a new " N " router . I thought I did my research but I guess not enough . At least list that these old " G " routers are not the best for newer electronics .  
  At first I was all , " Woo Hoo " but after 3 days my Ipod froze and never came back so I exchanged it at Best Buy for another one . 2 hours later , it turned off and never turned back on so I exchanged it for ANOTHER one and then this one had battery failure . Yes , it may be cute , but if you 're gonna put up that kind of money , get the 20 gig . After I got my full refund and a month later on my birthday I bought the 20 gig and I LOVE it ! I can fit 20 times more songs and it 's reliable ! And a month later @ Best Buy I oddly saw 4 ipods on markdown out of box . ( I swear to God those are all mine )  
  I bought this MP3 player as a xmas gift for my sister after comparing characteristics and price vs other brands . It worked for 3 days and then just died . We have tried all the troubleshooting we can think of / have been suggested and nothing has workedI 'm trying to get a replacement or a refund from sandiskThis failure adds to all the ones I 've had with flashdrives ( 512 kb and 2 GB ) I WON'T BUY ANOTHER SANDISK PRODUCT EVER ! Save yourselves all the trouble and frustration and look for other brands .  
  Like several other reviewers , my autofocus quit . Nikon service made it sound like they 'd never heard of the problem . When I mentioned how many other people were writing about a similar problem , the response was the same : " what problem ? " . I 've bought several Nikon 's over the years and have liked their service . I 'll shop other brands next time .  
  Wanted to connect a Mac Mini to a TV that had a component connection . Tried every configurations on 2 different TV 's . No dice on either . So I went with a Apple DVI-to-Composite / S-Video adapter . Now that works flawlessly !  
  For $ 500 ( or $ 600 for the 60GB edition ) you can get a computer . I think its a little to expensive for what you get . The battery life is better , which is a plus but other than that there is no significant improvement on the 4G iPod , except for the color screen / photo viewing which in my opinion is not worth 100 extra dollars . There are much better color screen and photo viewing mp3 player alternatives out there , at a much lower cost . Check out the Archos Gmini 400 ( can play videos also and its the same size as the iPod ) , iRiver iHP-320 ( bundled with FM Radio , In-line recording , voice recording ) , or Cowon iAudio M5 ( same as iRiver IHP-320 only smaller ) . [ .. ]  
  The only reason I am giving this a 2 star is because customer service was so nice when we went to return the product . I guess you get what you pay for with this product . Had it to hook my stereo to the TV and it worked perfectly for about a week , then the family sat down to watch a movie and boom , no sound . Refunded with no problems and the sellers were very quick to respond and help me with everything . Time to try another cable !  
  I purchased this set from BJ 's and it was dead out of the box . The service dept is totaly worthless . No way to expedite a repair even for a brand new product ! could take 5-7 days for parts . Can't bring it back because the box gets destroyed by there directions to get the set out . I will NEVER buy another Philips ANYTHING ever again .  
  I just purchased one of these because I 'm counting down the space on my computer , especially now that I 'm doing home movie editing on it . I thought this would be the perfect storage solution for my photo , video and audio files . However , I was a little leery . Good Thing ! As people have noted , it is ridiculously easy to set up . But , I did notice right away a nasty vibration . It had my whole desk throbbing . Mmm . I wondered if that was normal . Decided to live with it a few days before transferring files . Good thing - The morning of the third day , no power . Dead player . No lights , no nothing . The thing just croaked ! So glad I hadn't moved my files ! I purchased it elsewhere and will be returning it pronto . I 'll not be buying another . I 'll try a different brand this time . Too bad , I was so excited . I 'd give it no stars , but that wasn't a choice .  
  Your wasting your money if you plan on getting a new computer anytime soon . Customer service is very poor . They try to sell you on a " discounted upgrade " for $ 100 since this is useless with windows 7 but the " discounted upgrade is an old machine that does not scan color and is cheaper to get on Amazon .  
  I had another Sony VAIO for 8 years and never had a problem . This one arrived and seemed to be fine , but when I tried to use Outlook I started getting funny error messages . I called support and was diagnosed with a corrupted hard drive . I debated then whether to return it , but since I 'd had such a good experience with Sony before .. I sent it in . Didn't get it back for 28 days ( normal is 7-10 days ) . They had to replace the motherboard , a fact my repairs slip did not record - I found that out talking to a Sony tech when I was hunting it down . All in all a bad experience , the only good thing about this was Amazon , which gave me a refund .  
  This is the worst and I mean WORST Apple product I have ever used ! I bought one with my money because I was replacing my dead 3rd Generation iPod . I liked how small it was , and since I only needed 512 MB , it was a good buy for $ 99 in May 2006 . But then only a month later , I was listening to it on the bus and it died suddenly . It wouldn't turn on , but Apple gave me a new shuffle . Once again it died and it wouldn't come back to life . I got a pink nano for Christmas and that is way better than this piece of trash . I don't reccommend this iPod to anyone !  
  I received the 4214 due to a 20.00 off coupon and began making coasters immediately . I never in my wildest dreams thought I could create coasters in the privacy of my home & can now die happy . To make the dream even more sweet I purchased Adaptec Easy Cd 4.1 & was making fewer coasters ( darn ) but still made some after 5 calls to Creatives answer to long distance carriers dreams ( 20 + minute hold minimum ) they agreed to replace the obviously defective unit but they insisted on sending a refurbished unit further they forced me to speak to several people in order to convince them to accept a credit card # so as to reduce my wait time ( they wanted me to return the defective unit ) wait for them to diagnose it 's malady & then after verifying that it was faulty replace it . I am convinced it is only because I have 2000.00 of their stuff that they sent me the drive without my first sending the old one back first . Now here 's the kicker the new drive they sent is a 8433E not the 8432which I had & it is not supported by the 100.00 Adaptec software I purchased due to the Nero burning rom software which came with the burner being less than good . This took numerous long distance calls to Adaptec to detirmine . so all in all I would be forced to say DO NOT BUY THIS BURNER even though now after dounloading the update for Nero to version 5.22 it does work fine . It was far too much work & when you factor the cost of the now useless Adaptec software I paid 300.00 ! DO NOT BUY THIS BURNER !  
  I just received this today ( 3/19/2011 ) and sadly I am going to have to return it . I bought this because someone posted a review stating that they installed it into their MacBook ; however , I should have read the specs regarding the size . This will absolutely NOT fit into a MacBook , so don't buy this for that purpose .  
  The iAudio U2 is a nice mp3 player - but one of the big problems for me is the internal battery - it has to be recharged , you cannot just pop in another AA battery . And to make matters worse , the Product Description says that the AC Adapter / Charger is included ( COWON 's own website , the manufacturer , also says it is included ) - but it is NOT . Thus the only way to charge the U2 is with a USB connector , so plan on lugging your laptop with you to recharge your MP3 player . COWON tech / sales support says that " Includes " doesn't really mean include , it 's an optional item that must be purchased separately . And since Amazon doesn't carry , you 'll have to buy it from COWON directly ( ( .. ) ) . In trying to talk to COWON about this , I found out that you cannot , talk to them that is - they have no voice line for support - it 's all done by email or online chat ( when it works ) . Just another example of how servicing the customer has become a very low priority these days . My recommendation is to find another player that uses AA or AA batteries and buy some rechargeables . And if you have a problem with a COWON device , good luck getting someone to listen to you .  
  The earphones were too big for my ear . I used them to work out and they kept falling out of my ear because they were too big . I ended up having to purchase Jbuds and they had several different sized covers and they fit in my ear much better .  
  I bought this for the extension cable less than 6 months ago , and it 's already deteriorating . Specifically , I need to make sure the cable is in exactly the right position for the audio to go through . The fact that this happened so quickly screams low quality manufacturing to me . I 'm looking elsewhere in the future .  
  I got this camera from my uncle like 3 years ago . I was so excited when I got it but it doesn't really work . The batteries run out really quick and it 's really hard to put them on to the computer . There 's no flash so I couldn't take nighttime pictures . The pictures come out blurry and overall it 's worth the price because it barely functions .. I wouldn't buy it !  
  After setting up the printer ( which is very simple ) , it was put to work . It worked fine in scanning , copying , and printing . Then 48 hours went by .. it no longer wanted to work for printing . Hmm , that 's not good . Pros : shiny / flashy buttons . Scans to PDF ( except if using top tray ) Cons : printing fails after no more than 30 hours of use note : 30 hours of plug-in time , not 30 hours of printing ) . The other reviews are pretty accurate ( except the ones that say this is a good product ) . Other thoughts : Shame this one doesn't work . I 've been an HP loyalist since 1995 , using several different models . It 's frustrating that the older HP printers work better than this newer version and are more reliable . Gone are the days , perhaps , when printers lasted at least four years .. seems they ( HP ) want people to buy a new printer every month . Disappointing , cheap , won't make coffee ( or prints ) . In short : Buy at your own risk , and expect it to stop working as you want , when you don't want , and you 'll end up throwing it off a great height , or use it as a weight of some sort .  
  First let me say that I am a computer expert . I have been using Vista since the beta version , and I actually like it . I have also been testing Windows 7 , which is similar to Vista , but is supposed to need less computer resources and be MORE compatible . I love this printer on Vista with a USB connection . The network connection was a bit slow but the USB was great . The colors are incredible for a laser printer . I am a Realtor and do a LOT of printing . With this printer I can print my own fliers , which saves on printing costs . I 've owned the printer less than a year . HP has no intention of supporting this printer on Windows 7 64bit . So , now that I 've spent hours upgradding my main computer , not to mention hundreds of dollars for Windows 7 , I 've learned that my best printer is NOT compatible . So - if you are considering this printer , and there is any chance that you will be converting to Windows 7 - forget it , look elsewhere . By the way AMAZON is awesome - this is NO reflection on them . I am very angry with HP who has decided NOT to write Windows 7 drivers . If you are sticking with Vista or XP then this is a great printer .  
  These VHS tapes are garbage . On short play , ALL ( we bought 5 ) show distortion at the beginning of the tape . On long play they are completely unwatchable . If you are thinking it might be the VCR , think again , we have an older tape that looks perfect in short AND long play . I found better tapes at the $ 1 store back when you could find VHS tapes at the $ 1 store . Save your money .  
  It 's over priced piece of plastic and doesn't work . It doesn't come with instructions and i just doesn't work . I wish id read the negative reviews before i bought this  
  I bought this peace of trash because I thought I would be able to get a better signal-range and 108 MB transfer rate in my two-bedroom apartment ( using with Netgear desktop-PCI card ) but I all get was very low signal sometimes or nothing .. Mann , my neighbor uses a Belkin-Router and I am able to get an excellent signal . It seems to me that almost always Netgear likes to be first to bring new technology , but cheap + crappy , to the market . If it is a new technology and it is made by Netgear don't buy from them AND JUST WAIT , please wait , I am sure Linksys , D-Link or Belkin would probably make something better than Netgear . Furthermore , WPA never worked .. For technical-support , talked someone from India , who I thought just wasted my time . Disastrous -N E T G E A R = I DO NOT RECOMMENDED IT  
  J. schaulis 's review is fantastic . I wish he had commented on legal size copying and scanning . The most important things to copy adn scan in home are some legal papers . I find most Canon AIOs can handle legal paper , but they can not actually copy of scan legal documents ( not sure about printing ) , they can only copy or scan up to 11.7 " . If you want copy or scan true 14 " long legal paper , you have to use HP AIO.I hate legal size paper , but what can I do ? This is the USA , we use " legal paper " and stick to " inches " !
