  Brilliant over-acting by Lesley Ann Warren . Best dramatic hobo lady I have ever seen , and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none . The corn on face is a classic , as good as anything in Blazing Saddles . The take on lawyers is also superb . After being accused of being a turncoat , selling out his boss , and being dishonest the lawyer of Pepto Bolt shrugs indifferently " I 'm a lawyer " he says . Three funny words . Jeffrey Tambor , a favorite from the later Larry Sanders show , is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto . His character is more malevolent than usual . The hospital scene , and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site , are all-time classics . Look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting ( one bleeds ) . This movie gets better each time I see it ( which is quite often ) .  
  This movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone , but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation . Women and performers ( both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star ) are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in China . This makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture . The only problem I had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors ' performance . A welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies .  
  quote by Nicolas Martin ( nicmart ) from Houston , TX : " Fine film , but DVD " reformatted for TV " , 8 April 2002 - This is a charming and emotive film . On the other hand , the DVD I purchased has been " reformatted to fit your TV " by the clods at Columbia Tristar . There is no excuse for not providing the film in widescreen format , except that Hollywood treats all films like the moronic , disposable trash that it is so used to producing . What a shame . " What a ( criminal ! ) shame indeed . However , there is another version out though . See here for details http : / ww . dvdbeaver . com / film / DVDCompare2 / kingofmasks . htm Wonderful performances by the two main actors ( The King and Doggie ) BTW .  
  It 's a tale that could have taken place anywhere really , given the right circumstances . Street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing . The aging entertainer finds / buys a male child to pass his art to . From there , we follow them through the rigors of their challenging , but free life along the river . Traveling town to town , he performs and has some degree of notoriety . Despite the times and the influences , the man is kind and good . Overall , the performances are first rate , especially Xu Zhu , who portrays the street performer . The child ( Renying Zhou ) is beautiful , and downright strong , and withstands the overt prejudices well . The two protagonists , along with supporting help from the kind opera singer , Master Liang ( an interestingly androgynous Zhao Zhigang ) , paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness , sadness and love . Some have mentioned this film 's remote similarities to BA WANG BIE JI ( FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE ) ; yet this film can't stand easily on its own , any resemblance is remote at best . My only qualm with the KING OF MASKS , is the ending . It was weak , cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer . The audience was already wrapped up in the story , what was the needless manipulation for ? What a shame . To bring a fine motion picture that far , only to surrender to emotional ( and corny ) pathos like that . It frankly made this film good , instead of the classic , it should 've been . That aside , the KING OF MASKS is still very well worth your time . I was happy to see the Shaw Brothers are still producing good films . Highly recommended .  
  I enjoyed the cinematographic recreation of China in the 1930s in this beautiful film . The story is simple . An older male performer wants to pass on his art to a young man although he has no living children . The faces of the actors are marvelous to see . The story reveals the devotion and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well . The operas in the film remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE , which was more sophisticated and intricate . The story here reminds me of a Dickens tale of days when children were almost chattel . The plot is a bit predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but well worth the time to view for the heroism , humanity , and history portrayed .  
  Stargate SG-1 follows and expands upon the Egyptian mythologies presented in Stargate . In the Stargate universe , humans were enslaved and transported to habitable planets by the Goa'uld such as Ra and Apophis . For millennia , the Goa'uld harvested humanity , heavily influencing and spreading human cultures . As a result , Earth cultures such as those of the Aztecs , Mayans , Britons , the Norse , Mongols , Greeks , and Romans are found throughout the known habitable planets of the galaxy . Many well-known mythical locations such as Avalon , Camelot , and Atlantis are found , or have at one time existed . Presently , the Earth stargate ( found at a dig site near Giza in 1928 ) is housed in a top-secret U.S. military base known as the SGC ( Stargate Command ) underneath Cheyenne Mountain . Col . Jack O'Neill ( Anderson ) , Dr . Daniel Jackson ( Shanks ) , Capt . Samantha Carter ( Tapping ) and Teal'c ( Judge ) compose the original SG-1 team ( a few characters join and / or leave the team in later seasons ) . Along with 24 other SG teams , they venture to distant planets exploring the galaxy and searching for defenses from the Goa'uld , in the forms of technology and alliances with friendly advanced races . The parasitic Goa'uld use advanced technology to cast themselves as Egyptian Gods and are bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship . Throughout the first eight seasons , the Goa'uld are the primary antagonists . They are a race of highly intelligent , ruthless snake-like alien parasites capable of invading and controlling the bodies of other species , including humans . The original arch-enemy from this race was the System Lord Apophis ( Peter Williams ) . Other System Lords , such as Baal and Anubis , play pivotal roles in the later seasons . In the ninth season a new villain emerges , the Ori . The Ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy , also bent on galactic conquest and eternal worship . The introduction of the Ori accompanies a departure from the primary focus on Egyptian mythology into an exploration of the Arthurian mythology surrounding the Ori , their followers , and their enemiesthe Ancients .  
  Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories . The music is great , you get a real feel of what the world of Jesus looked like ( I 've been there too ) , and June gets into the part of Mary Magdalene with a passion . Cash 's narration is good too . But .. 1 . The actor who played Jesus was miscast . 2 . There is no edge to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith based music . 3 . Because it is uncompelling , I doubt we 'll see this ever widely distributed again . I 'd love to buy the CD . Tom Paine Texas , USA  
  I took a flyer in renting this movie but I gotta say , it was very , very good . On all fronts : script , cast , director , photography , and high production values , etc . Proves Eva Longoria Parker is head and shoulders in rom / com above bad actors such as Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston , who mug and call it acting . Who'da thunk it ? Parker and Isla Fisher are in a class by themselves in this regard and should try to hold out for projects as good as " Over Her Dead Body . " Lake Bell is excellent , too , and this is the first time I have seen her . And finally , Paul Rudd gets to shine in a really good movie , instead of lesser films . A movie like this never gets its dues from close-minded males . It 's too bad . As other IMDb reviewers here have noted , there is nothing lame about this gem - no hack writing or acting . And its depiction of contemporary L.A. and California , in general , makes every scene look bright , beautiful , clean , and otherwise outstanding in every way . Never before has a movie made L.A. look so good . Ah , what a little talent and a lot of caring can do for a movie . I won't divulge the plot , but as a long-time and hard-core atheist , I was willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the supernatural theme in order to enjoy an excellent and light-hearted piece of entertainment . It reminds me very much of the old " Topper " movies , which were also so enjoyable . This movie exposes popular , but otherwise hackneyed , movies like " Ghost " for the mediocre and overly sentimental crap fests they are . We already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre . Some of us save our praise for the truly worthy , however . If you have enjoyed other overlooked gems such as " Into the Night " with Michelle Pfeiffer , Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager , " Blind Date " with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger , " American Dreamer " with JoBeth Williams , " Chances Are " with Robert Downey Jr . , Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard , " Making Mr . Right " with John Malkovich , etc . , you 'll enjoy this . A first-rate job all around ( even if it 's kinda hard to believe a straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years . ) But even that plot device doesn't detract from the movie 's overall excellence .  
  In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review , this film actually was surprisingly good ! I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés , obvious jokes and overacting , all of which the trailer had promised . However , after 5 minutes in I found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting . With only one ' toilet humour ' gag , Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and , without spoiling anything too much , some of the moments involving animals are hilarious . The staple ingredients of a good film are all there ; script , director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy , this film stands tall . Sure , you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening , but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time !  
  This isn't exactly a great film , but I admire the writers and director for trying something a little different . The film 's main theme is fate and small , seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future . In some ways this reminds me of the film SLIDING DOORS , though instead of focusing on one random event , seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion . Plus , an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene-like he 's some sort of omnipotent being but there 's absolutely no explanation of him in the film ( like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY ) . The DVD jacket shows just Audrey Tautou . This is capitalize on her success in AMELIE , though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role . The pace is brisk , the acting fine and the conclusion isn't bad at all . The only reason I didn't score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and I think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots .  
  Being a giant monster fan , me seeing " Yeti " was an absolute must , especially after hearing so much about it . Thanks to the good ' ol bootleg market I was able to find a copy pretty easily , and was happily surprised upon watching that this flick was actually , dare I say , decent . Decent for what it is , actually , namely a cheesy giant-monster flick . It kicks in pretty quickly as Yeti is found pretty much immediately , and we get introduced to various characters . They consist of some sleazy ones , some good ones , and a girl who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girls in any cheesy sci-fi film , by far . Yeti looks like a long-haired guy straight out of the original Woodstock concert , and really , he 's not that bad of a dude , especially after being introduced to the world in some kind of funky cage-like thing . Godzilla he is not - despite his rude awakening , he doesn't even rampage ( actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture ) , but kinda just looks puzzled while trying to figure things out . Yeti seems to understand English pretty nicely ( my copy was dubbed in English ) and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are . However , we want to see the giant Yeti do his thing , and he 's pretty much in the whole movie , and in typical low-budget fashion , he seems to change size a lot depending on the scene and there 's even a bunch of the " fake legs " shots of him just standing there . Yes , the special effects aren't the greatest , but there are definitely some good ones here . A scene where Yeti smashes through a warehouse is done very well , and in another , he uses the windows of a building as " ladder steps " to climb down from the top of it - shattering each window with his foot and often shocking the occupants inside - in one sequence that really looks much , much better than it should in such a " bad " movie . " Yeti " never stoops as low as say , " A.P.E. " does . Actually the only time it even comes close to genuine silliness is when the beautiful girl causes Yeti 's nipple to become erect and he lifts his eyebrow in an " oh yeah baby " manner . But even this isn't that bad , and kinda even gets a laugh out of the viewer . The movie is pretty long for this kind of thing , but surprisingly enough it doesn't get boring - the story is actually good , and just watching this utterly gorgeous actress on screen will make any male viewer happy . " Yeti " may not be in the upper echelon of giant monster flicks , but it is definitely better than other King Kong ' 76 rip-offs like " A.P.E. " and " Queen Kong " by very far .  
  I have always been keen on watching Hong Kong movies , but all of them failed to meet my expectations .. until now ! BURNING PARADISE doesn't contain the flat humor most HK movies have , nor a second rate story line that has been dragged into the film . The story is not complex , but there are never scenes that are just there to fill some " intelligent " space ( the only truely intelligent martial arts film I have seen is CROUCHING TIGER , but since Hollywood is involved it is no true HK movie for me ) . There are some incredible fight scenes in this movie , from the first one ( which is one of the coolest I have ever seen , yet so short ) to the last main scenes ! But mind , there 's also a lot of blood that flows ( people cut in half , decapitated , etc ) . The production is pretty good and the special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even though some shots must be pretty technical ( notice : the sheet of paper that he throws and got pinned into a wall ! ) . Yep , it 's not Tsui Hark or John Woo that made my favorite Hong Kong film , it 's Ringo Lam ! And I 'm sure as hell going to check out more from this director ! Ace .  
  This movie has to be my favorite of all time . Its not supposed to have a plot , because its makers wanted people ( Charlie Sheen , I think ) to believe it was a real snuff film . This was an exercise in visual effects , and doesn't cut away when the action happens like every other film does . Movies these days are now all about sound effects , leaving the visuals to be made by computers cause its easier to deal with CGI blood . There still are movie makers who still can't get fake blood to look like the real thing . There is no rape scene because that wasn't the point of making the film . Have you seen the hills have eyes 2 ? The rape scene was funny instead of shocking . Although i 'm sure there are some GONZO porn film makers that have tried to marry porn with horror . But since they probably suck at making films , they probably wouldn't be able to pull it off . The movie " Baise Moi " has a disturbing rape scene because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything even though the movie overall sucks . Its too bad that a movie can't be made without thinking of the money aspect of it all , especially when talking about an AO or NC-17 rating . I 'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make his Hostel film series much much better , but he has too tame it down to get an R rating .. or at least I hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations . Watch Traces of Death or More than Smashed Pumpkins if you want no frills real footage ( accident & crime scenes / footage ) . Don't forget that this movie was made in 1985 . The fact that this film can still stand up against most crap made these days says a lot about this film . That would be like someone saying the 8bit Super Mario Brothers sucks because the PS3 has better graphics .  
  A film destined to be on late-night TV long after the present instant " money-makers " have long been forgotten . Perhaps a little too subtle for today 's youngsters , but in time they 'll grow into an appreciation of this movie .  
  This a good episode of The New Twilight Zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories ( I note both of them are based on short stories ) . " Examination Day " is set in the future , year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves , huge TV-looking " phones " that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age .. and the Examination Day , a point where 12-year-olds must undergo a government-required IQ test . The kid is this story , Dickie Jordan ( David Mendenhall ) is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid , so is calm , even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades . His parents ( Christopher Allport and Elizabeth Norment ) , on the other hand , say he shouldn't have used his birthday wish on getting a good score , and while their reason includes that they believe he 's capable and he should have no need to worry , it 's pretty obvious they are worried . I won't give anything away in the ending , but I will say this - there 's a point where we get a glimpse of what 's to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject : that evening ( or another ? ) his parents ask Dickie whether he 'd prefer to watch TV all night . By today 's standards , we 'd be pleased he 'd say he 'd rather read and not just because there 's nothing worth watching .. but why would his family ask this ? The flavor of what 's encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from Harrison Bergenon ( which I hear hasn't received a great adaptation to the screen ) . I only wish they could 've provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as The Obsolete Man was . I found it to be better than the short story it was based on . I haven't read the one that " A Message from Charity " was based on , but would like to since it was interesting - a 16-year-ld boy , Peter ( Robert Duncan McNeill ) is suffering a fever from unclean water , that has always been common in his Massachusetts hometown .. but he is able to see through the eyes of a young Puritan woman suffering the same type of fever , Charity Payne , ( Kerry Noonann ) who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him . They both recover , especially since it 's common for that to happen in 1985 , but the connection doesn't go away . Charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each other 's company , especially Peter , who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students , even at the college he 's been staying in one place at . Things take an unexpected turn , though , when Charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from England as a sign of bewitchment , added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever ( not so common in 1700 ) . The two try to learn a way to save her . The ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching . Both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times , through a lesson / warning that sounds like something Rod Sterling would 've cooked up and entertainment , make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship , love , and wisdom do a great deal . Probably 3/4 of this has no theme , but somehow I think it all would have been approved by Sterling 's crew .  
  You know how Star Trek fans flocked to all the Star Trek movies , even the really bad ones ? Why ? To see their heroes in action one more time . That 's the way I feel about Doc Savage . I am a major fanatic for the character , and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming . And the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation . Then they decided to crib elements from a number of Doc adventures and throw them into this one movie , resulting in a somewhat disjointed film . There 's a lot of promise in here , diluted by a number of unfortunate choices ( the music , the " camp " elements , etc . ) But the spirit of Doc is there , and that 's what those of us familiar with Doc and his crew respond to . So , in my long-winded way , what I 'm trying to say is that this is not a bad movie : it 's just not as good as it should have been . And anyone who is a fan of Superman , James Bond , Indiana Jones , Buckaroo Banzai , and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all .  
  Having read many of the other reviews for this film on the IMDb there is ostensibly a consensus amongst purists that this film is nothing like the books upon which it is based . Upon this point I cannot comment , having never actually read any of the protagonists adventures previously . However , what I can say with certainty , is that it strikes me that many of the said reviewers must have surely undergone a sense of humour bypass ; Let 's be honest here - this film is just so much fun ! OK .. so I must concede the point that the film apparently is not representative of the character / s but let 's put this into a clear perspective .. do the same individuals who are carping on about this film also bemoan the fact that the classic 1960 's Batman series does not remain faithful to the original DC comic book character ? Or perhaps is there STILL unrest in same persons that the 1980 film version of Flash Gordon was too much of a departure from the original series ? The point is , yes this film is incredibly camp but that 's precisely its charm ! Former Tarzan , Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero in this ( and bears more than a passing resemblance to Gary Busey to boot ! ) and is backed up by a great supporting cast who all look to be having a ball with their respective roles . Also look out for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by horror movie favourite Michael Berryman . Best scene ? Far too many to choose from but check out the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men commit the ultimate faux pas of ordering coke , lemonade and milk at a formal occasion ! Also the often noted scene near the end of the film wherein Savage tackles his nemesis Captain Seas utilising various martial arts disciplines which are labelled on screen !  Priceless ! Simply put , the film doesn't take itself at all seriously and is all the more fun for it . Great fun from start to finish ! ( and you 'll be singing the John Phillip Sousa adapted theme song for days afterwards guaranteed ! )  
  * Possible spoilers * I recently watched this movie with my 11 year old son and was pleased to see that he laughed in the right places and was thrilled by the action sequences . Ron Ely is just right as Doc . Cool , calm , almost always in control ( and with an occasional twinkle in his eye ) . What more can one ask for ? I have never read a Doc Savage book , so I don't know if it is faithful to the source but I enjoyed the light tone and derring-do . Many people have compared this movie to Raiders of the Lost Ark , which I don't think is fair . The difference in budget is astounding ( Raiders must have at least 10 times the budget ) . Doc Savage does not have the extensive location work that Raiders has . Special effects are also at a minimum but come on people , the story is a lot of fun and the humor is just right . The Sousa music is catchy ( love that theme song - Every time I watch the film , I end up humming the theme for days ) . The best way to approach this film is to just RELAX and enjoy . Highlights include the exciting opening sequence where the fabulous five and Doc chase the Indian sniper throughout the rooftops of New York and the VERY funny fight sequence between Doc and Captain Seas . Not as good is the villain who sleeps in a giant crib ( really ! ) . Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day . I give it 7 out of 10 . Doc Savage , Doc Savage .. thank the lord he 's here !  
  When the Chamberlain family is camping near Ayers Rock , Australia , Lindy Chamberlain ( Meryl Streep ) sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience . For it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press , and the whole thing turns into a circus . Lindy doesn't help matters either because she won't play to the jury or courtroom , she 's only herself , and she 's a tough nut to crack , so of course everyone thinks she 's guilty because there 's a piece of evidence that hasn't come to light . Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain , a Seventh-Day adventist pastor , who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife . It 's good ( or bad ) to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the States too , because the Australian public doesn't believe the story and the media only fans the flames . Eventually , Lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor , but years later , a missing piece of evidence shows up and she 's freed , but not until after the family 's life is basically ruined . A heart-breaking story , very well done , a bit long but well worth seeing . 8 out of 10 .  
  Religious bigotry is rampant everywhere . Australia is not immune to it . A dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having " killed " her own baby . I don't mean to spoil the story for you , but you need to know the basics before getting knee-deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison . Buy or rent the movie and discover how deep-seated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globe . This is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors . Both Meryl Streep ( with her famous Aussie accent ) and Sam Neill , whose accent is his native-born pronunciation , are outstanding . Those with supporting roles are also quite good . You will remember this movie for many years . See it !  
  As with all the other reviewers , this movie has been a constant in my mind after 30 years . I recall going to the library researching all that I could on this story . I even wrote to the PBS station for more information . Despite all this , all I was able to find out was that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early part of the 1900s . Fastward to 2002 , after years of searching ebay for on a weekly basis and there it was , a VHS copy of the movie . There was one other bidder but I was determined to win this movie . The losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which I gave her . Despite owning a copy , I still searched and searched finally finding a site that sold a DVD copy of the movie . You can find it at : http : / ww . johntopping . com / Harvey % 20Perr / War % 20Widow / war_widow . html  
  A fantastic Arabian adventure . A former king , Ahmad , and his best friend , the thief Abu ( played by Sabu of Black Narcissus ) search for Ahmad 's love interest , who has been stolen by the new king , Jaffar ( Conrad Veidt ) . There 's hardly a down moment here . It 's always inventing new adventures for the heroes . Personally , I found Ahmad and his princess a little boring ( there 's no need to ask why John Justin , who plays Ahmad , is listed fourth in the credits ) . Conrad Veidt , always a fun actor , makes a great villain , and Sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves , who at one point finds a genie in a bottle . I also really loved Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra , the father of the princess . He collects amazing toys from around the world . Jaffar bribes him for his daughter 's hand with a mechanical flying horse . This probably would count as one of the great children 's films of all time , but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays . Kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when Abu and the genie are on screen together . And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful . Although most of the younger generation probably thinks that King Kong looks bad at this point in time , Willis O'Brien 's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn't even look remotely like a spider . 8/10 .  
  This movie is intelligent . That is , more than most other movies , it transcends the least common denominator - stupid people will probably not appreciate it . The story also relies heavily on dialogue . It has some parallels to Lost in Translation , although Before Sunrise is much brighter , somehow less abstract , and simply a lot better . The script , the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic . The actors play absolutely brilliantly . Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together . The dialogue moves into very personal issues , with the risk of becoming a little over the top . It does , however , stay on the right side almost all the time , although I found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing . Balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors . Sometimes , it yields great results , and overall this movie is simply stupendous ! Only very , very rarely is " love " in films depicted in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic . Every time that is achieved , the result is fantastic . I think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect . She still looks stunning in this film , 12 years after . This is simply a gem of a movie that you can't miss . One of the best movies I have seen from the 1990s !  
  It was by accident that I was scanning the TV channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other . Ethan Hawke ( Jesse ) " Tape " ' 01 and Julie Delpy ( Celine ) " ER " 94 TV Series ( Nicole ) . This gal and guy , will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years . Jesse and Celine have great conversation , and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them . I am looking forward to the SEQUEL to this film in 2004 and if you have viewed this film , you will feel the same way .  
  This was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption . I loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family . Well-acted and well-directed . If there were any flaws , I 'd have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again . What about all people of all cultural backgrounds ? I would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown - like in real life . Nevertheless , the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker . Loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes  
  It may ( or may not ) be considered interesting that the only reason I really checked out this movie in the first place was because I wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out Humphrey Bogart in his CASABLANCA ( 10/10 role for the Best Actor Oscar . ( I still would have given the Oscar to Bogie , but Paul Lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination , at least . ) Well , I 'm glad I did check this movie out , because I enjoyed it immensely . I think the movie did preach a little , but not only did I not mind , I enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them . The acting was outstanding in this movie . I especially enjoyed Paul Lukas , Lucile Watson ( rightfully nominated for an Oscar ) , Bette Davis ( wrongfully not nominated ) , George Coulouris and , oddly , Eric Roberts , who plays the middle child . I really enjoyed his character : an odd-looking boy who talks like some sort of philosopher . He just cracks me up . Even the characters name ( Bodo ) is funny . The ending , in which Lukas 's character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons , worked for me as well . I agreed with why he felt he had to what he did , and I understood why he couldn't quite explain it . The message this movie makes is a good and noble one , the scenery ( meaning the house ) is beautiful , and the acting is the excellent . Watch this movie if you ever get a chance . 9/10  
  Yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award-material . But then it doesn't try to be anything it is not . A fun-filled romp with real funny one-liners , a stellar and very funny performance by Peter O'Toole , a grounding and down to earth performance from Joan Plowright . The band 's performance was on the spot , each one playing their role in a deft , comical manner . The music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely . From some of the negative comments I deduced that the subtlety of some of the humour went over their heads . A good example is the comment about the " strange baseball-like game " , well my dear American , that was cricket - from which baseball is derived - and the explaining of it to the ignorant US band was very funny for those that do know cricket . Also no , you were not supposed to wince when Carl broke a window ; it was funny how Lord Foxley said " oh yes ! " to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time " oh no " also referring to the money . Jeez , it seems that every joke must be explained to some people .. All-in-all I enjoyed it and had some great laughs ! Well worth seeing .  
  Great actors , an oscar nominee actress , stunning scenery , good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag ( and thats quite big ) . This film was brilliant . It was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were . . well , side splitting . I have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much , and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the ' stoned ladies in the tea shop ' scene . Well done to the British film industry and to Craig Ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my favourite films of the year , if not of all time .  
  I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the UK . Well actually , it doesn't , because this film is everything a Hollywood film isn't - original , creative , quirky and humorous . It seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of movie as , in the simplest terms , it doesn't conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film . I haven't written a review for the IMDb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention , even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes ! Essentially , it is about nothing , as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world . The brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white , empty space . This is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors , both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles . I 'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit . However I encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try . A very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well-executed fashion , with the combination of good performances , a strong script , nice sound design and ( fairly ) impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie . It 's just a shame so few people know about Nothing ..  
  An opium den , a dirty little boy ( actually a midget ) , prostitutes galore , a violent fracas in a dive , a motel for sexual shenanigans , scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot , a boozer falling down the stairs , a racially mixed clientèle in a bar with Asians , Africans , and Anglos treated equally , does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall ? Wrong . These are all scenes from a 1933 musical . The first half of " Footlight Parade " is preparation for a musical extravaganza which occupies the last half of the film . Chester Kent ( Cagney ) is about to lose his job and does lose his playgirl wife as a result of talking pictures squeezing out live stage musicals . His producers take him to see a popular talky of the day , John Wayne in " The Big Trail . " Before each showing of the flick , a dance number is presented as a prologue . Shorts , news reels , serials , and cartoons would later serve the purpose . Kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the dwindling live musical business . Kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer Busby Berkeley . Could it be that Cagney 's character is patterned after Berkeley ? Could be . In preparation for the prologues , Kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival . He uncovers the traitor , fires him , then unbeknown to him a new leak is planted in the form a dazzling temptress . His assistant , Nan Prescott ( Joan Blondell - soon to be Mrs . Dick Powell ) has the hots for Kent and is determined to expose the wiles of the temptress . A new singer from Arkansas College shows up in the form of Scotty Blain ( Dick Powell ) who turns out to be a real find and is paired with Bea Thorn ( Ruby Keeler ) . The resulting three prologue musicals , which couldn't possibly have been presented on any cinema stage of the day , are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were over seventy years ago , " Honeymoon Hotel , " " By a Waterfall , " and " Shanghai Lil . " Of special note is the song and dance of tough-guy James Cagney . Like Fred Astaire and Bill " Bojangles " Robinson , Cagney 's dancing appeared natural and unrehearsed , although hours went into practice to get each step just right . Not as good a singer as Astaire , Cagney 's singing , like Astaire 's , sounded natural , unlike the crooning so popular at the time . It 's amazing that one person could be so talented and so versatile as James Cagney . Most critics prefer the " Shanghai Lil " segment over the other two . Yet the kaleidoscopic choreography of " By a Waterfall " is astonishing . How Berkeley was able to film the underwater ballets and to create the human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated . The close up shots mixed brilliantly with distant angles is a must-see . The crisp black and white photography is much more artistic than it would have been if shot in color . Though not nearly as socially conscious as " Gold Diggers of 1933 , " " Footlight Parade " stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever put on the big screen .  
  I saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary . What I love most about it is that it is understated and low-key , but deeply heartfelt . Henry Thomas ' ( he played the child in E.T. ) performance is masterfully inarticulate ( he is supposed to be a man of few words ) . David Straithern is a wonderful crazy villain . And miraculously ( given that we 're talking about a Hollywood product here ) a baby serves as a main character , but one who doesn't act or have lines , but rather just IS ( & is luminous at that ) . Interesting to note that Thomas ' mysterious relationship w . E.T. was the core of that film ; while his bond w . the baby serves as the core of " A Good Baby . " Then there is the music-ah , what music ! Gillian Welch 's tunes are wonderful & the entire score is gorgeous hill country music . This film is wonderfully atmospheric . I recommend it highly .  
  Harem Suare is the best film I saw in the year 2000 . Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek . Sensually shot and stunningly portrayed , Harem Suare is a bold film that tackles interracial romance , which is such a taboo in Hollywood . Women of all shapes , sizes , and color , populate the film . Cut off from the outside world , the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue , rivalry and jealousies within their ranks .  
  I just viewed Detention last night and i liked what i saw . It was a cool fun movie . Dolph looked superbly cool on the Bike . He also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies . He is now in a pretty good shape . The story was ok and the other actors were also passable . I wouldn't call this movie his best but its still a good movie . But it also had its share of Problems . The first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target . They should 've had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way . Another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing . I dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom . The third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers . There should 've been more bad guys . Last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy , but that was due to the small budget . Overall the movie was a good Movie . I enjoyed it . I would recommend others to watch it . P.S. Now u r a DEAD beat cop . ( Some One-liners were also cool )  
  Nicole Kidman is a wonderful actress and here she 's great . I really liked Ben Chaplin in The Thin Red Line and he is very good here too . This is not Great Cinema but I was most entertained . Given most films these days this is High Praise indeed .  
  The perfect space fantasy film . a group of kids go up accidentally in space and have to get back down , but do they , sure they do . This would not be a family film if they all died . Then it will all be sad . You don't want that Kate Capsaw , the leading lady gives a Golden Globe performance , but sadly , she nor Lea Thompson won one . That sucks so bad . I can't say it enough , this film is so great , Lea Thompson - o lord , a perfect girl for this film . This film is the best for sure . Sorry , but better than Star Wars . Star Wars is so over - rated and space camp was so under - rated . It should of been the other way around excellent 10/10 - 0r maybe 11/10 . Iam not good at math  
  dark angel rocks ! the best show i have seen in ages damn those people who took it off ! me and my friends have gatherings to watch every DA episode ! takes like 4 days but it is worth it ! it finished before it finished what it wanted to say and that annoys the hell out of me !  
  It 's a good movie maybe I like it because it was filmed here in PR . The actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome ! The guy is cute too so it 's a good match if you want to the guy or the girls .  
  Yowsa ! If you REALLY want some ACTION , check out the babes and bombs on this non-stop thriller ! Veteran star MARTIN SHEEN leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism .. but director Dean Hamilton doesn't let this heavy plotline get in the way of massive doses of TEENSY-SWIMSUIT scenes , jiggly beach jogs , hubba-hubba hot tubs and the like ! Want action ? You 'll get more of it here than in PEARL HARBOR . Want babes ? You 'll get an eyeful every two minutes . Want more ? Go out and BUY THIS VIDEO ! Yowsa , Yowsa , Yowsa ! That 's some mighty spicy meatballs !  
  A classic cartoon , always enjoyable and funny . It has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters . Road Rovers is a show worth seeing , it is a short 13 episodes , and if you can ever manage a chance to see it , you should . Unfortunately , it is very hard to find . I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD that contains all 13 episodes . I would definitely buy it if they did , and if they do , you should buy it too . if you have kids who like dogs , they will love road rovers ! Road Rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired , it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was .  
  A true hero of modern times , Chuck Norris has left TV " Walker , Rexas Ranger " , and is looking new steps for his artistic career . The President´s man is the second movie of a future TV series , with Norris in the title role , and with young actors like Jennifer Tung or Judson Mills ( one of the young rangers of " Walker " ) . The old master teachs to young aspirant . It´s one of the most powerful themes of " The president´s man " . In this tima , " A line in the sand " has reached world surprise for his tratment of terrorism in USA , months before the tragic September 11 . Eric Norris , son of Chuck is the director . The movie is amusing , a good action work , plenty of fights and heroism . Chuck Norris have many plans for the future . Bells of innocence , his next picture , will be the following .  
  I also saw this upon its release in ' 56 , and have been struck since then with its final scene . If this is an answer to ' High Noon , ' then it 's an apt and apposite response . The notion that , as this string is headed , " The town comes together " is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of ' High Noon . ' In this theme , ' Concho ' is a phenomenal precursor of one my other all-time favorites , ' The Magnificent Seven . ' Both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing performances , especially Sinatra 's transformation from bullying kid brother to liberating town savior . I can only hope that at some point all the friends and family on whom over the years I 've inflicted my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves .  
  Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a solid hit rate as far as their TV work is concerned . However , their film work has been much more chequered ( 2008 's The Bank Job was fine , the previous year 's Across The Universe decidedly weak , for instance ) . Still Crazy , fortunately , is a solid success . It has a great story , excellent performances , a lot of humour , fabulous music and , above everything else , real heart . I savour " moments " , and this film has one of them - just when everything is going pear-shaped at the festival reunion performance .. Hugely enjoyable .  
  Election is a Chinese mob movie , or triads in this case . Every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader , and at first it seems a toss up between Big D ( Tony Leung Ka Fai , or as I know him , " The Other Tony Leung " ) and Lok ( Simon Yam , who was Judge in Full Contact ! ) . Though once Lok wins , Big D refuses to accept the choice and goes to whatever lengths he can to secure recognition as the new leader . Unlike any other Asian film I watch featuring gangsters , this one is not an action movie . It has its bloody moments , when necessary , as in Goodfellas , but it 's basically just a really effective drama . There are a lot of characters , which is really hard to keep track of , but I think that plays into the craziness of it all a bit . A 100-year-old baton , which is the symbol of power I mentioned before , changes hands several times before things settle down . And though it may appear that the film ends at the 65 or 70-minute mark , there are still a couple big surprises waiting . Simon Yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picture . Election was quite the award winner at last year 's Hong Kong Film Awards , winning for best actor ( Tony Leung ) , best picture , best director ( Johnny To , who did Heroic Trio ! ) , and best screenplay . It also had nominations for cinematography , editing , film score ( which I loved ) , and three more acting performances ( including Yam ) .  
  Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions , so I turned to my twin sister and said , " Hey this looks like fun , " - truly I love documentaries - so we started watching it . At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man , but then it was explained that due to his condition , he never went through puberty , thus the high voice and smaller body . He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause . He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality .. I cried , watched some more , laughed , got up to get another Kleenex , then cried some more . Once Jonni Kennedy 's " time was up " he flew to heaven to be with the angels . He was more than ready ; he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free . I highly recommend this . If you do not fall in love with this guy , you have no heart .  
  I recall seeing this movie as a kid . I don't recall where I saw it . I must have been around 14 years old . I thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again . It came on the Kung Fu channel once , but I missed it . I was really bummed . It is the best special-effects Kung Fu movie that I 've seen to date ! I highly recommend it , and now that I 've discovered where to get it , I can enjoy it once more and for years to come . I also have to check out this Return of the Venom movie of which some have spoken so highly .  
  This show probably won't appeal to everyone . Sarah does what she wants ; she doesn't ask for permission and she doesn't apologize . This is a sitcom with zombies , robot dinosaurs , flying cars , and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders . The star of the show is not a hero , she is a spoiled , bigoted pervert . If you can't appreciate the offbeat humor it offers , the show probably isn't for you . Everyone should at least give this show a chance . It brings together the comedic styling of Sarah Silverman , Brian Posehn ( The Comedians of Comedy ) , Jay Johnston ( Mr . Show ) , Steve Agee ( Bobcat Goldthwait 's ' Stay ' ) and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon ( Heat Vision & Jack , Monster House ) . It also showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community , channel101 . com . ( If you 're into this show , keep an eye out for " The Department of Acceptable Media " on vh1 this March , it 'll be drawing from the same talent pool . ) Watch Sarah Silverman 's show . This kind of stuff is the future of entertainment .  
  I knew about but had never seen Grey Gardens , before I saw the Broadway musical of the same name . Friends cautioned me that if I had not seen the movie , the musical would not make sense . It did , but it also prompted me to rent the movie . At first , I thought it was a train wreck , full of strange , shrieking characters , and it was exceedingly hard to watch . But being able to stop it , digest it and go back to it made me realize why Grey Gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary . Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self-consciousness is worth witnessing . Both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age . They have a relationship that will chill any woman ( and undoubtedly some men ) and make you re - examine your own dealings with your mother . In an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace , it 's fascinating to see the Mayleses ' work from three decades ago , and realize what an impact the film must have had . I echo what other posters have said : how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family ? But beyond that , how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion ? Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped ? I would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track , which gave me additional insight into the film .  
  Why should you watch this ? There are certainly no reasons why you shouldn't watch it ! Superbly and amusingly directed by Albert and David Maysles , Grey Gardens was originally intended to be a film on the gentrification of East Hampton , but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of the two Edith Bouvier Beales , the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis . Their life was certainly an amusing one ( Edith spent most of her day in bed singing operas , Edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats , one was named Ted Z . Kennedy ) The film is interesting because it is both funny and sad - Edith died shortly after the film was released ( in February 1977 ) aged 82 after experiencing some of the fame that she and Edie received after the film ( she danced and sang in a nightclub Edie Beale Jr was born in 1925 and is still living in Miami Beach . This film is both engaging and spellbounding .  
  The daughter 's words are poetry : " I can't go on another year . I got to get to a hotel room . " " I lost my blue scarf in a sea of leaves . " " The marble faun is moving in .. he just gave us a washing machine . That 's the deal . " " I 'm pulverized by this latest thing . " " .. raccoons and cats become a little bit boring for too long a time . " " .. any little rat 's nest , mouse hole I 'd like better . " And there is wisdom in the mother 's words : " .. yes the pleasure is all mine . " " This little book will keep me straight , straight as a dye . " " Always one must do everything correctly . " " Where the hell did you come from ? " " .. bring me my little radio I 've got to have some professional music . " " I 'm your mother . Remember me ? " The mother / daughter relationship is drawn in this magnificent film . This is a Mother 's day film .  
  Don't read anything about this movie ( especially nothing that could contain any spoilers ) . Just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it - and you 'll have a really great experience . If you like to see an intelligent , twisted story : Go , get the DVD and you 'll truly not be disappointed . " Cypher " is not really a sci-fi movie , more a psycho thriller settled in the environment of globalized business . It 's about corporate secrets , how big companies spy each others research departments and the methods used by them . The actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect mode of coldness . Cypher is much deeper , more complex and - what belongs the story and the ending - also much , much more satisfying than Vincenzo Natali 's other movies " Cube " and " Nothing " . Actually it 's one of the best movies I 've ever seen ( and that 's something I really don't say this about every fifth well-made flick ) . Sorry , can't tell you anything more about this movie without risking to hurt your experience . Just give it a chance . ; - )  
  You 'll notice by the stars I 've given this GREAT film that ' .. before you see it the first time , ' is implied . I had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week ( and last ) was a very slow rental experience ( not much great coming in ) . I 'm not sure how this movie slipped past me -I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too . Still , it did . This movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don't have a large budget . It had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark ; just enough . The entire film is you ( the viewer ) trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns . I would have given this film 10/10 , however some of the shots were pretty fake looking . I don't hold that against this film too much , but I don't think it deserves a perfect score . Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious ( as always ) . I think she 's pretty underrated as a serious talent . Nevermind her beauty ( which is difficult ) , she really takes her roles seriously and doesn't rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion . And she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed , as well . Jeremy Northam does really well , at first , as quite a geeky corporate rat , willing to run through any maze to prove himself . However , as he changes throughout the film , it 's like night and day . I know some fans of Clive Owen , Jude Law , or other hopefuls to become the next James Bond will hate me for this , but Northam would / could / should fit that bill . He 's suave and cultured . He 's got a great Bond posture and voice . I think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it , and rather down-to-Earth , as well . Great film and definitely this movie-buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films .  
  If you 're one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as ' Book of the Dead ' , ' Book of Eibon ' or ' Necronomicon ' , then you should feel right at home with Malefique , a film which also features an occult tome , one with the power to change the destinies of all involved . Discovered by four French prisoners sharing a cell , the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by Danvers , a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s ; a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished . Finders of the book are Carrère ( Gérald Laroche ) a company embezzler shopped by his wife , Lassalle ( Philippe Laudenbach ) who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body-builds to execute an escape plan , the halfwit Pâquerette ( Dimitri Rataud ) who once ate his baby sister , and the ' librarian ' Marcus ( Clovis Cornillac ) , supposedly driven mad by reading , who murdered his wife . Reminding the viewer of Meat Loaf 's equally bizarre , bosomy male in Fight Club ( 1999 ) , Lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet , one who is especially protective of the infantile Pâquerette . With the coming of the book however , and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents , Marcus assumes greater and greater significance . At first assured of an early bail , meanwhile Carrère takes little more than academic interest in events . Suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and , as the prisoners experiment , Danvers ' book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers .. Staged for the most part within a prison cell , and between four or five characters , Malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter ( as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers ) . Only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell , a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed , closed-in nature of proceedings elsewhere . More than anything , this is a film about being trapped , either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding . " I 'm going to escape , " says Carrère at the start of the film , wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son . Whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price , and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an ' escape ' may not be one a man might imagine . With all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first-time feature director Eric Vallette 's credit that his film succeeds as well as it does . As critics have noticed , it is a film with strong Freudian overtones - Lassalle 's distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance ; the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye ; the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus ; Danvers ' original placenta fetish ; the dark cell as a primitive womb from which ' delivery ' is awaited , etc . With so many interesting aspects to the script Vallette hardly puts a foot wrong , and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what , when one comes down to it , is just a matter of four guys , four bunks , one folding table and a book . There 's a genuine , growing , Lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages , while one or two moments - the aforementioned blinking vagina , or what ultimately happens to Pâquerette - are unsettlingly memorable . The pacing of many of the dark events in Malefique is deliberate , rejecting the rapid cutting of many Hollywood productions : a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick-fix action and gore . Perhaps this is a particularly European manner , as one recalls a similar , measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as Verhoeven 's The Fourth Man ( 1983 ) - a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye . Lensed well in 1.85:1 , Malefique benefits from excellent performances and , if for this viewer at least , the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been , the journey to the final shot was worth taking . Coming so soon after the release of the similarly well-received Haute Tension ( aka : Switchblade Romance , 2003 ) , this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the French industry , this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from Asia  
  i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic-comedy i have ever seen . it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation . the thought that maybe they won't get together .. it is an indie film after all . this movie was well written , directed and acted . the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent .  
  At the end of the movie i still don't know whether i liked it or not . So was the case with most of the reviewers . But none the less i still feel that the movie is worth a 7 for the amount of efforts put in . long ago i read a quote : THERE ARE 2 KIND OF WRITERS , 1 . THOSE WHO THINK AND WRITE . AND 2 . THOSE WRITE AND MAKE THE READERS THINK . while here i feel that GUY Ritchie took this way too literally and left all the thinking for the audience . i felt that the movie was a mixed bag filled with some of THE DEVILS ADVOCATE and FIGHT CLUB .. it is definitely a classic : something which no one understands but appreciates .. what i don't understand : why stathom ( Jake Green ) had a blackout ( thats how it all began ) , all the riddles and mysteries in the movie have been taken care of except this one . well if you are reading this review to find the solution as what this movie was all about : i 'll post the very midnight it strikes me and if you are still deciding to watch this movie or not : then answer this first .. when you come across a puzzle labeled as ' no one has ever solved ' would you like to try ? i would  
  I 'm giving ten out of ten it 's one of the best movies ever . Absolutely smashed , stunned and dazed by the whole picture , marvellous playing of Jason Statham , Ray Liotta and all the crew , amazing plot .. Just look into yourself and pluck up your courage to admit-it touched your soul , because it 's strange , but there are all the answers you 've been ever looking for .. The very best , mr . Ritchie ! THE VERY BEST EVER . Those who were looking for a simple figtings and skirmish keep yelling they are disappointed . But there are lots of shallow movies in Hollywood nowadays , you can't remember what it was about the next day you had seen it . On the contrary , Revolver is unique , I could have hardly expected it 's possible to portray such a clear and genius picture of myself , of everyone who was to watch it . Absolutely unsurpassed , astounding , dazzling .. One can get insight watching this , I have no doubt about that . Actually , no words can express my admiration .. I 'm still wondering how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of giddy Hollywood rubbish we had been watching . Thank you from all heart , it 's simply the best .  
  Wow . I LOVED the whole series , and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly . Perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons 4 & 5 , while remaining better than anything else on television . But 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons . 6B started with such a sombre mood and Janice 's always keen insight into the family angst - that doom-filled line about knowing Tony 's penchant for sitting and staring . Anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know Tony . Melfi 's discomfort over the psychiatric study and its references to the sociopath 's self-deluding sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series , say , with Tony 's panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool and resonates with Phil 's " wave bye-bye " line to his grandchildren before the coup de grace of the final episode ( not to get into Chase 's dark humour ) . I could go on and on , but I 'll just add that I thought the final show - starting with the opening strains of Vanilla Fudge to supply the ironic foreshadow ( " You Keep Me Hangin ' On " ) to the terminal moments where Tony fades back into complacency with his family in tow or blasts apart like AJ 's SUV or Phil 's head were , utterly , utterly PERFECT . The best TV ever . Pretty good in a dying medium pathologically supplying the " jack-off fantasies " AJ derides ( and then into which he promptly subsides ) . A tip of the pork pie to Mr . Chase .  
  Saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released . Had me snifflin ' like a baby as I left the theatre , trying not to let anyone see . So , when I saw it again now in ' 07 , I knew what to expect & the sobs were ready & primed as their required moment approached . Thankfully this time I was at home . What I hadn't remembered from my youthful viewing - or perhaps hadn't noticed because of it , was the technical brilliance of this movie . The use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue . The camera work which seemed to place the viewer , together with the characters in the scene . Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to the diner , the camera pans behind the woman & child sitting on a bench in the foreground , framing the street scene . The story itself , & the characters - seedy , sad & brutally real . It is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn . Then again , Joe & Ratso could be any of us . Must have been ' 70 when I saw it . I recall that upon leaving the theatre I was impelled to find the company of friends . All these years later , I 'm glad I 'm not alone tonight . This is one hell of a great movie .  
  Joe Buck ( Jon Voight ) decides he 's going to leave his small life in Texas and make it big in the Big City . The women are there for the asking and the men are mainly " tutti-fruttis . " Wide-eyed , he comes to New York City , not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences , one worse than the other . In the middle of that chaos , he meets and befriends Rico " Ratso " Rizzo ( Dustin Hoffmann ) , a homeless-looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building . There isn't much of a story as MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only Joe Buck 's plights in the City , but also inter-cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi-psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past : his failed relationship with his girlfriend Annie ( Jennifer Salt ) who was gang-raped , his abandonment by his mother , and his apparent abuse by his grandmother , who also had a habit of hustling men for money . An air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as Nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery " Everybody 's Talking ' " ; we feel that even while we want Joe to eventually make his mark in the City , the odds are high he won't and will end up working for pennies in a dead-end job - shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself . We know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this . A dark story of dashed hopes , John Schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s , and at the center , the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life . There is the implied notion that they may have been lovers - Ratso 's reaching out to hug Joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this - but this is essentially a buddy film , one that manages to survive , literally , to the death , and bring some form of hope to Joe who at the end in Florida seems much changed , older , wiser .  
  This is a very funny movie ! I have no idea whether it translates well into other languages or not . However , I do think men all over the world can identify with " Frank " and his thoughts to some extent ! These thoughts are hugely entertaining and women will also enjoy this movie I 'm sure ! All cast members perform well , and this film could have been a tremendous hit all over the world if it was made in England or the US . But for those of you who are fortunate enough to understand Swedish , you are in for a treat ! Highly recommended .  
  I love this freekin movie ! Walsh is a true master of the cinematic form , his film have been sometimes in my opinion , overlooked . But this film is a favourite of mine because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set in . \ All the wonderful characters that existed , the lifestyle , the mode of dress , the way they spoke , OK they might be exaggerated , but it is good to know that there were occasion when two men tried to outdo each other with insane stunts . I just felt it was apiece of history thats should be wathced by many people and appreciated because of that fact . Can I get it somewhere on DVD ? I have only seen it on TV . But for anyone wanting a slice of life movie about that period of time this is the perfect one .  
  As this happens to be one of most favorite novels , I was very excited to see the move . I was not disappointed ! Yes of course there are a few things that I could pick on , but I think that the movie stuck true to the book , and was a really good movie . It seems that Stephen King films mostly get a bad review , but this is one of the good ones . It is such a dark story , which I guess is why I like it .. and what is better than the dead coming to life .. and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too . If you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book ! It is a well written screen play , the actors could have done a better job ( I only say this for Rachel , and Ellie .. she was so whinny ) I liked everyone else a lot .. and most important to me .. it stuck true with the novel .  
  Buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when " humanizing " animals , and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them . Based on a true story , Buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other , and that they will do anything for each other . While not a perfect movie , the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children . This film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets , but does show the difficulties . A recommended film which was the first for Jim Henson Productions .  
  The story is extremely unique . It 's about these 2 pilots saving Earth from alien beings but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age rapidly . The whole series is about the pilots dealing with the loss of time , friends , and mentors . The ending COULD have been fantastic . It started to end on a total down note and leave a real mark but instead ended on a super happy Disney note and annoyed me VERY bad . The animation is decent for 89 but can't compare to nowadays . I have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudity . I actually found it to be somewhat decent . The nudity for the most part was warranted except in episode 2 where there was an excess . Overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic .  
  I kind of consider myself as the # 1 fan of Hidden Frontier , seeing as I am among a somewhat small group of fans who have actually met most of these guys - well , not counting conventions , of course . I have been watching Hidden Frontier since 2001 , and I must say I continue to be impressed by what these guys have come up with . Hidden Frontier is the brainchild of Rob Caves and his self-made studio , Areakt Pictures , which operates out of the back room of his house . While not as " fancy " as , say , the TOS-based series New Voyages ( which sometimes gets some of the actors / writers from the original series , like Walter Koenig , aka Mr . Chekov ) , Rob and the cast and crew of HF manage to create a series worthy of replacing that ghastly experiment we called " Enterprise " . The most controversial and successful story arc has been the introduction of Star Trek 's first openly gay character , Corey Aster ( who was introduced in the second season ) , and his search to find a soul mate . Somewhere later in the series , he meets Jorian Zen , the Excelsior 's Trill helm officer . In the recent story lines with these two characters ( WARNING : MAJOR SPOILER ! Do not read if you have not watched the series up to this point ! ) , Zen is joined to an exiled symbiont , causing a great deal of change and some conflict in his relationship with Aster . Though the future is uncertain - seeing as the most recent episode , " Beachhead " , was just shown to HF fans in the chat room last night - I think that this relationship will endure , but only time will tell . Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek with the intention that the story be more about his characters rather than flashy space battles . Rob Caves created Hidden Frontier for that same reason - and this is what has made this series as popular as it is . As the previous comment stated , I wish I could give it a rating higher than 10 , but it will have to suffice . Although next season will be the last - keeping in the tradition of seven season shows started by Star Trek : The Next Generation - I am willing to bet that we will hear much about Hidden Frontier after that final episode .  
  Make no mistake , Maureen O'Sullivan is easily the most gorgeous Jane ever , and there will never be one more gorgeous . She is visually stunning . That aside , it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film . This is a great film . It not only has the classic Tarzan aura , but also the feel of the continuing saga . We become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory , one of them in love with Jane , the other , a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history . And these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic . There is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted . However , the Africans are depicted as individuals , and at the end , two even become more heroic than the white hunters , and stand out as such . In fact , the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters . The finale , also , is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie . The great lion attack has never been duplicated , and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction . If I left anything out , it is because I do not want to soil the picture for those who haven't seen it . But it is everything you could want in a movie .  
  One of the best Tarzan films is also one of its most action packed ( and graphic ) . Picking up a year or so after Tarzan the Ape Man , Niel Hamilton 's Holt has asked a rich friend to finance a safari back to the elephants graveyard to collect ivory . His Friend arrives also carrying dresses and perfumes that Holt hopes to use to win Jane back from Tarzan . Before they can leave Holt finds his map stolen and it becomes a mad dash to try and capture a competing expedition . When they finally over take the thieves they find the whole party dead and themselves surrounded . They have no choice but to fight their way out and soon find they are out of the frying pan and into the fire . Eventually Tarzan and Jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures . Infamous film was heavily censored to reduce the graphic violence ( Its graphic even by todays standards . It probably would get a PG 13 ) and to remove all hint of nudity , ( there is a several minute long nude swim scene involving Jane that is full frontal in its nudity , it was only recently restored ) . Its clear watching the restored version why this film was reduced by 20 minutes in its run time for TV . As it stands in its restored version this is a very adult film that is romantic , touching , action filled and everything else that a movie should be . Its an amazing film by almost any standard . Best of all its the sort of film that plays well both as a stand alone adventure , one need not to have seen the first film to enjoy it , but its also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were set up in that original film . Its an amazing thing . I really like this film a great deal . If there are any flaws to the film , its perhaps that the film hasn't aged well . The rear screen is often very obvious , there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing . However on almost every other level this film is top notch . You really owe it to yourself to see this . Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and curl up on the couch and just let yourself drift back to a simpler time . This is one of the great adventures .  
  I recommend watching this film with your significant other if you 're planning a romantic evening with him / her . The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen . After the original film , we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other . Jane 's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan 's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically , but also quite sexually in love . One 's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally , romantically and sexually . And Jane 's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality . The skin show in this film is off the charts . In addition to Jane 's two-piece sexy midriff , leg , and hip baring costume , she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan . ( although it is not O'Sullivan , but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene ) Weissmuller , also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth . The ladies will delight when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips . It 's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry . Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come , they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie .  
  This is a delightful movie that is so over-the-top that my wife , daughter , and I found it irresistible . The plot is just crazy but " rings true " to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities . I particularly enjoyed Kevin Kline 's and Sally Field 's performances . I don't anyone better than Kline at playing THICKheaded . Field 's character 's truly desperate need for attention and affirmation - and her almost bipolar swings in mood - played nicely against the background of Field 's famous ( infamous ? ) " You like me ! " Oscar exclamation . People who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world . I think this is the only movie where I didn't find myself impatient with Whoopi Goldberg characterization ; I thought she was " spot on " in every note she struck . Robert Downey Jr . , Teri Hatcher , Cathy Moriarty , and Elizabeth Shue were also first-rate as well . Just a great movie if you 're in the mood to go along for the ride and LAUGH !  
  This is a great movie to see with your girlfriend . My friend and I both love dance and ran into this movie at the video store . We had to get it . With no violence and such a warming story its a great movie to relax to and just enjoy your night . I would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie .  
  Claire Denis 's Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film . The film presents a very interesting look at the household of a European colonial family living in Cameroon , giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction . However , the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient . For example , a central theme in the story is young France 's inability to form strong relationships with others . Although this portrayal is executed flawlessly , notably in the way that Denis frames the story with scenes from France 's return to her childhood home , the girl 's lack of intimacy with the film 's other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development ( or lack thereof ) as a protagonist . The general stagnation of the film 's character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot . The film raises a great deal of tension between characters , particularly between Aimee and the men in her life , but never fully addresses this social friction , leaving the viewer unsatisfied . The final few scenes are powerful but depressing . Denis 's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint , but if you are looking for a film with adventure or drama , Chocolat is definitely not the best choice .  
  As a person who sought out an existence as a ' professional ' person with income backed by a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Management , my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more artistic . My post-post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography , stained-glass , ceramics , metal forging / welding , and art drawing that also included silk screening . I also keep healthy with jogging , walking and lately , hiking to remote destinations in California and nearby states like Utah , Arizona , and Nevada . Jogging , walking and hiking gets one close to the earth with time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds . Within that background , I was obsessed with RIVERS AND TIDES . I was equally impressed with the documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy as well as the skills and smoothness of Director / Cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer . I actually could not separate the art of Goldsworthy with camera path of Riedelsheimer . Wonderful . Wonderful . Wonderful .  
  Saw this movie at the Rotterdam IFF . You may question some decisions of the maker - like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject - but this movie sure hits you in the gut . Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch . Hope it gets the distribution it deserves .  
  The Unborn is a very , very different film . James Karen & Brooke Adams are in the film and they performed quite well . this film is builds up solidly and it keeps you going . Though I think you must be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot . There is one brief sex scene with no nudity that could have been left out and to some people this scene may disappoint someone like Me that 's into the film and thinks that stuff ruins a good film but that 's it when it comes to that . There is a scene where Adams ' character goes nuts and kills a cat but you can tell its not real . The music is very different but very good . The Unborn in My opinion is a really creepy film that 's superbly unpredictable and that 's quite strange ! I recommend all horror fans to this movie !  
  The Unborn is a Roger Corman production and as such is nasty and tasteless . If you hate pregnant women , check out this movie because it 's chock full of preggo killings and failed abortions . Brooke Adams stars as Virginia . Her and her square of a husband go to some fancy fertilization clinic because they can't have kids on their own . There they meet Dr . Meyerling ( James Karen of ROTLD 1 & 2 ) . Dr . Meyerling has had a very high success rate at getting couples pregnant . ( Insert joke here . ) Is it because he 's creating some genetic killer supermutant babies ? That 's what Virginia starts to think when she starts having some odd side effects and extreme moodiness from the treatment . That 's when she starts taking matters into her own hands . On this one , you 'll have to get the rest of the details somewhere else because if I told ya all the goodies this one had you might hurt yourself putting it on your Netflix rental queue too quickly . It 's a bit slow-moving for a while but once it picks up in the final third , all systems are go ! Very highly recommended by me on the strengths of its un-PC fetal violence . 33 1/2 out of seventeen stars .  
  You can do a lot with a little cash . Blair Witch proved that . This film supports it . It is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity . However , because it has John Cleese as Sherlock Holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldn't afford a shoestring . The highlight of this film is Arthur Lowe as the sincere , bumbling Watson , his dimness and slowness foils Cleese 's quick-tempered wit . If you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two .  
  Based on Neil Simons play of the same The Odd Couple tells the story of best friends Felix Unger ( Jack Lemmon ) and Oscar Madison ( Walter Matthau ) who end up sharing Oscars massive bachelor pad after Felix tries to kill himself . He had a big row with his wife over his obsessive compulsive cleaning sprees and weird phobias and sends her a suicide telegram . She calls Oscar and lets him know what happened . Felix turns up at Oscar 's during his weekly poker game with their friends Vinnie ( John Fielder ) Murray the policeman ( Herbert Edelman ) Roy ( David Sheiner ) and Speed ( Larry Haines ) . After some side splitting hysterics it 's agreed Felix will stay with Oscar . The rest of the film centres on how these two are such completely different characters . As well as looking at if Oscar can stand Felix 's truly weird and unique habits and cleanliness and if Felix can stand Oscar being such a slob and his laid back attitude to everything . Really a film about two complete opposites living together and the joys , highs , lows and necessity of the gift that is friendship . With great acting an intelligent and very funny script and the great Monica Evans and Carole Shelley as the British Pigeon sisters who Oscar invites over for a double date . This one is guaranteed to make you laugh every line is priceless and Jack and Walter are fantastic with a great chemistry . Also made into a successful and equally funny TV series with Jack Klugman as Oscar and Tony Randall as Felix .  
  This cordial comedy confronts a few bizarre characters . Especially , of course , the two leading characters . Jack Lemmon plays Felix , a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because she couldn't stand his cleaning and cooking attacks any longer . So he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails . Walter Matthau plays Oscar , his friend , an untidy , unreliable sports-reporter who lives in divorce from his ex-wife in a bachelor apartment . He offers his distressed friend Felix a new home in his apartment . And soon the trouble begins because two such contrary characters can't live together for a long time . Felix turns Oscar 's disorderly flat into a clean exhibition flat . He cleans and cooks the whole time . After a short while , Oscar feels persecution mania .. Filmed in a theatrical way and excellent acted . Above all , Jack Lemmon 's play is wonderful . He is the perfect clown . He makes us laugh but in a tragi-comic way . Look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two female neighbours for supper , because Oscar has to touch something more softer than a bowling-ball . While he is preparing the drinks , Felix sits with the two young ladies in the living-room . To get out of this embarrassing situation , he starts to talk about the weather . A minute later , he changes the subject and talks about his ex-wife and children . Suddenly he begins to weep and when Oscar comes back with the drinks , there are three weeping people in the living-room . The film is full of such amusing and at the same time touching scenes . An intelligent , entertaining comedy with much heart . 10 out of 10 !  
  This movie catches a lot of flak , but this is usually based on the horrible looking and covered / clothed version of the film that played US television and has also been issued to death on VHS and DVD buy companies like Alpha , Unicorn , etc . This movie never had a theatrical release in the states , although it was picked up by Avco Embassy in 1973 . In Spain at the time , when there was nudity involved , the filmmakers shot two versions , one with clothes and one with out . The fully uncut English dubbed export print was titled WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS and seems to have been released to home video only in Sweden back in the 80 's . It can be found on Ebay and the likes and comes highly recommended . My guess is Avco cut the film down for a R rated release that never happened . In 1974 it was released by Avco to television titled FURY OF THE WOLFMAN and the clothed version was used for this TV print . Cut to 12 years later and FURY OF THE WOLFMAN pops up on home video on the Charter label . This version appears to be what Avco was going to release back in ' 73 . It 's the uncovered version , with some nudity that would never pass on TV or in a PG movie . There are several scenes on the Charter tape that play out with nudity that are clothed in the TV print ( the source for all those dollar Dud 's and VHS editions ) . But a comparison to the fully uncut WOLFMAN NEVER SLEEPS reveals that 2 scenes are cut on this version ! ( spoilers in next paragraph ) The scene where Ilona has Waldermar chained to the wall and whips him after he transforms into the werewolf is incomplete . After whipping him into submission , she starts to remove her clothes and begins making love to the werewolf ! The werewolf responds positively to these sexual shenanigans too . This scene certainly ranks as one of the most unusual in the history of horror films and is a delirious treat . It 's not graphic but the implied bestiality was too much for US audiences , or more likely the MPAA . Ilona is desperately in love with Waldemar and could not possess him , hence her whole scheme to mind control Waldermar 's wife and involve her in an affair . She wanted to wreck his marriage , and she accomplishes this while Waldemar is in Tibet . Unfortunately he returns a werewolf , but this does not slow her down a bit . If she can't physically have him as a man , she loves him enough to have sex with him as a werewolf . This also helps explain the later scene where the werewolf beds down with a woman he spots getting naked before bedtime while peeping through her window . This scene is presented sans nudity in the covered version and really makes no sense . In the uncut version , it would seem Ilona 's affections have made the werewolf horny and in need of release , so he rapes the first woman he can after escaping . The other cut is a complete scene of Waldemar in bed with Karen and she is seen naked . A very similar bedroom scene was cut out of the US version of WEREWOLF SHADOW ( WEREWOLF VS THE VAMPIRE WOMAN ) as well . The film does have it 's problems though , for certain . The director was drunk , the bad stand in for the werewolf at points , the atrocious English dubbing , the inclusion of sequences from the first Waldemar film MARK OF THE WOLFMAN aka FRANKENSTEIN 'S BLOODY TERROR and the grotesque overuse of that film 's music score throughout etc , but seen in it 's original widescreen format and uncut ( ie : WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS ) it is one of the wildest and most outrageous of the Daninsky werewolf series , with a plot line unmatched in it 's everything but the kitchen sink approach . The cut / clothed pan and scan full screen copies of this film do it no favors , and unfortunately that 's the version almost everyone commenting on the film have seen . The film carries a 1970 copyright , and I 'd bet the 1972 release date on the IMDb is incorrect . The film precedes WEREWOLF SHADOW ( aka WEREWOLF VS THE VAMPIRE WOMAN ) in the series and was certainly released before WEREWOLF SHADOW . The ending of WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS / FURY OF THE WOLFMAN dovetails directly into the opening of WEREWOLF SHADOW , offering concrete evidence of this . Sadly a complete version of this may never get a decent release . A perfect release would be the uncut English version but in Spanish with English subtitles . The English dubbing severely hurts the movie . But any Spanish language version would reflect the covered version as shown in Spain during the Franco era , where nudity was verboten .  
  Someday somebody is going to write an essay comparing Paul Naschy 's " Fury of the Wolfman " to the great Spanish surrealist films , " L'age D'or " and " Un Chien Andelou " . The Naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end . Dali and Bunuel probably loved it , and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull off . The film lacks cohesive structure even though it does have a plot that moves from A to B to C . Some mishmash about a " Professor Walterman " - his first name , mind you - who was bitten by a Yeti monster during an expedition to Tibet and hasn't been the same since , which is understandable . One of his jealous colleagues , the insane daughter of the noted Doctor Wolfstein , knows about his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him . But its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beast . " Walterman " flips out , turns into a werewolf , kills a few people , is electrocuted , dies , is buried , unburied , taken to a castle filled with circus freaks , wired to various machines , zapped with assorted electronic effects , injected with potent elixirs , is chained up , turns into a werewolf , a woman in an evening gown with thigh-high Nazi fetish boots whips him , he escapes , helps the pretty female doctor find her way out of the castle , fends off the circus freaks with a battle axe , eventually turns back into a werewolf , and has to fight to the death against the female werewolf incarnation of his cheating wife . The lady with the Nazi boots shoots him with silver bullets from her Luger pistol , they die together , and the pretty doctor walks off into the morning with the studly reporter , who did nothing . " Look ! What a beautiful day it is ! " " La furia del Hombre Lobo " was written by Paul Naschy in a hurry . Original director Enrique Eguilez was fired and replaced by José María Zabalza , a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production . He was often unable to work ( though he did find time to instruct his 14 year old nephew to make some alterations to the script ) and Naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited . Zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of Naschy 's previous movies , " Mark of the Wolfman " . The scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different , and helped pad out the runtime after Zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie . Post production was a nightmare . Nobody knew who was doing the editing , the money ran out , the master print disappeared for a while , and then at a pre-release screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find Zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater . He was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curb . Yet somehow the film works , if you let it . It keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles , vaulted catacombs , chains , whips , gloomy moors . Fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesn't make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution . In one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning ; in the next shot its bone dry and he 's howling at the full moon . Then its raining again . And yet you don't look at it as a gaffe . Its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible , opposites are the same , and effects proceed causes ; First the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams , and then the cable starts sparking with electricity . People say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness - I say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend . It is a marvel of making something out of nothing , and succeeds not because of what it could of had , but because of what it does . It 's easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it . The trick is being able to see through the mayhem , or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effect . Paul Naschy died last week at the age of 75 . He had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more , was working on film projects right up until his last days , but passed away in Madrid , Spain , with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment . His rich , varied , and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disinterest . And yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like " Fury of the Wolfman " in rapt awe . Even people who don't like Euro Horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at , if only for just a minute in a couple spots . You can find it for free at Archive . Org or even buy it on a DVD for a nickel . It 's worth far , far more . Amusingly , Naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted , sick , demented little movie as a classic , if not an outright masterpiece of Cinema Dementia . The problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for Naschy to forgive . I would never presume to dare to forgive it for him , but I will say this : I 'd rather watch " Fury of the Wolfman " in its dingiest , most cut and degraded fullscreen public domain print than ever sit though the overbearing , obnoxious crap churning out up at the Swine Flu cineplexes this or any other weekend . The world lost a great artist this month . Watch his films , and remember . 9/10  
  It 's funny . It 's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot , but man this is funny . Kline and Fields are great . ( Her toss-off line " God , you are so disGUSting " as she climbs in his window - great ! Kline 's running into the door after scoping out Teri Hatcher - great too ! ) Robert Downey Jr . and Kathy Moriarty work together flawlessly - until he finds out who she really is .. a soap opera turn if there every was one ! The scene near the end in the chinese dining area had my kids and I rolling on the floor - that scene alone is worth the rental price . Doesn't solve any world problems or show the seemy underbelly of daytime T.V. ( I hope ) . Just a lot of fun .  
  Red Eye is a thrilling film by the creator of Freddy Kreuger , Wes Craven . Wes Craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker Lisa . After attending the funeral of her grandmother , she decides to take the red eye flight . During waiting , she meets this man named Jack Rippner , ( how ffrreeaakkyy is that ? ) and they sort of become friends . Ironically , both sit right next to each other on this plane . Then this is when the horror starts . This movie is thrilling and to the weak hearted people who don't like thrilling / horror films , well lets say that its possible that they might pee in their pants . This is an excellent example of a bone shaking production . Wes Craven did well with this film . He chose the right actors , like Rachel McAdams , an intelligent , sexy girl who knows what she 's doing and is cautious of everything when she 's acting in a film . Cillian Murphy , the scary and horrifying actor who can chill your bones at his amazing acting being the bad character in this film , and his face can really widen your eyes . Wes Craven did an excellent job and I hope that he makes more films like this one .  
  OK Clara Bow silent film from 1927 , it 's a spin-off of Rain , with Bow playing the half-Hawaiian wild daughter of the local pineapple king who falls in love with the staid English engineer-Clive Brook . Bow competes with the local widow ( Arlette Marchal ) for his attentions , but both women get a big surprise when his wife shows up ( Patricia Dupont ) . The predatory wife is ready for a divorce until she discovers he might be on the verge of a fortune . Bow settles her hash fast . Bow has personality to spare and has a few great scenes : her opening nude bath , her hula in a grass skirt , and the dog rescue scene with Bow and Brook doing their own stunts . Note : the IMDb credit list is wrong . The film credits ( from the DVD I have ) list Patricia Dupont as playing Mrs . Haldane-not Margaret Truax as listed on IMDb .  
  Hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of " 8 " s , this movie 's true score . As mentioned before Chris Rock is The King ! Previous to going to see this movie I wasn't that over the top about him but now I 'm banging on the doors of Chris Rock 's website begging him to take me on as his protege . This film is truly funny , if you don't find this movie funny you REALLY need therapy and it 's humour which targets all areas of society including race ( predictably ) , class division , love , wealth , employment , dreams , stand up comedy .. the list goes on . There was one slight disappointment for me however . This was that in going into this film I didn't realise that it was actually a remake of " Heaven Can Wait " another quite good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty . As such I was quite surprised when I watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie I had watched on TV a few weeks ago .. Regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that Chris Rock is funnier than Warren Beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any .. you get the picture . Well to the actual plot of the film . Don't spoil the experience for yourself ! Don't read the plot ! Just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on IMDb so far that have raved mad about it , go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time , go and see it because it 's a cinema experience that doesn't leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets . Go see it because it is a good movie !  
  I would say for it 's time , this movie was awesome .. and yes if you have no desire to become a Christian , then why bother watching it . I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be very moving . I see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the Left Behind series .. they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people . I think in order to actually judge this movie , you should see it , there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken .. don't use our comments to judge , see the movie for yourself ! God will bless you if that is why you are watching them .  
  Match 1 : Tag Team Table Match Bubba Ray and Spike Dudley vs Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit Bubba Ray and Spike Dudley started things off with a Tag Team Table Match against Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit . According to the rules of the match , both opponents have to go through tables in order to get the win . Benoit and Guerrero heated up early on by taking turns hammering first Spike and then Bubba Ray . A German suplex by Benoit to Bubba took the wind out of the Dudley brother . Spike tried to help his brother , but the referee restrained him while Benoit and Guerrero ganged up on him in the corner . With Benoit stomping away on Bubba , Guerrero set up a table outside . Spike dashed into the ring and somersaulted over the top rope onto Guerrero on the outside ! After recovering and taking care of Spike , Guerrero slipped a table into the ring and helped the Wolverine set it up . The tandem then set up for a double superplex from the middle rope which would have put Bubba through the table , but Spike knocked the table over right before his brother came crashing down ! Guerrero and Benoit propped another table in the corner and tried to Irish Whip Spike through it , but Bubba dashed in and blocked his brother . Bubba caught fire and lifted both opponents into back body drops ! Bubba slammed Guerrero and Spike stomped on the Wolverine from off the top rope . Bubba held Benoit at bay for Spike to soar into the Wassup ! headbutt ! Shortly after , Benoit latched Spike in the Crossface , but the match continued even after Spike tapped out . Bubba came to his brother 's rescue and managed to sprawl Benoit on a table . Bubba leapt from the middle rope , but Benoit moved and sent Bubba crashing through the wood ! But because his opponents didn't force him through the table , Bubba was allowed to stay in the match . The first man was eliminated shortly after , though , as Spike put Eddie through a table with a Dudley Dawg from the ring apron to the outside ! Benoit put Spike through a table moments later to even the score . Within seconds , Bubba nailed a Bubba Bomb that put Benoit through a table and gave the Dudleys the win ! Winner : Bubba Ray and Spike Dudley Match 2 : Cruiserweight Championship Jamie Noble vs Billy Kidman Billy Kidman challenged Jamie Noble , who brought Nidia with him to the ring , for the Cruiserweight Championship . Noble and Kidman locked up and tumbled over the ring , but raced back inside and grappled some more . When Kidman thwarted all Noble 's moves , Noble fled outside the ring where Nidia gave him some encouragement . The fight spread outside the ring and Noble threw his girlfriend into the challenger . Kidman tossed Nidia aside but was taken down with a modified arm bar . Noble continued to attack Kidman 's injured arm back in the ring . Kidman 's injured harm hampered his offense , but he continued to battle hard . Noble tried to put Kidman away with a powerbomb but the challenger countered into a facebuster . Kidman went to finish things with a Shooting Star Press , but Noble broke up the attempt . Kidman went for the Shooting Star Press again , but this time Noble just rolled out of harm 's way . Noble flipped Kidman into a power bomb soon after and got the pin to retain his WWE Cruiserweight Championship ! Winner : Jamie Noble Match 3 : European Championship William Regal vs Jeff Hardy William Regal took on Jeff Hardy next in an attempt to win back the European Championship . Jeff catapulted Regal over the top rope then took him down with a hurracanrana off the ring apron . Back in the ring , Jeff hit the Whisper in the wind to knock Regal for a loop . Jeff went for the Swanton Bomb , but Regal got his knees up to hit Jeff with a devastating shot . Jeff managed to surprise Regal with a quick rollup though and got the pin to keep the European Championship ! Regal started bawling at seeing Hardy celebrate on his way back up the ramp . Winner : Jeff Hardy Match 4 : Chris Jericho vs John Cena Chris Jericho had promised to end John Cena 's career in their match at Vengeance , which came up next . Jericho tried to teach Cena a lesson as their match began by suplexing him to the mat . Jericho continued to knock Cena around the ring until his cockiness got the better of him . While on the top rope , Jericho began to showboat and allowed Cena to grab him for a superplex ! Cena followed with a tilt-a-whirl slam but was taken down with a nasty dropkick to the gut . The rookie recovered and hit a belly to belly suplex but couldn't put Y2J away . Jericho launched into the Lionsault but Cena dodged the move . Jericho nailed a bulldog and then connected on the Lionsault , but did not go for the cover . He goaded Cena to his feet so he could put on the Walls of Jericho . Cena had other ideas , reversing the move into a pin attempt and getting the 1-2-3 ! Jericho went berserk after the match . Winner : John Cena Match 5 : Intercontinental Championship RVD vs Brock Lesnar via disqualification The Next Big Thing and Mr . Pay-Per-View tangled with the Intercontinental Championship on the line . Brock grabbed the title from the ref and draped it over his shoulder momentarily while glaring at RVD . Van Dam ' s quickness gave Brock fits early on . The big man rolled out of the ring and kicked the steel steps out of frustration . Brock pulled himself together and began to take charge . With Paul Heyman beaming at ringside , Brock slammed RVD to the hard floor outside the ring . From there , Brock began to overpower RVD , throwing him with ease over the top rope . RVD landed painfully on his back , then had to suffer from having his spine cracked against the steel ring steps . The fight returned to the ring with Brock squeezing RVD around the ribs . RVD broke away and soon after leveled Brock with a kick to the temple . RVD followed with the Rolling Thunder but Brock managed to kick out after a two-count . The fight looked like it might be over soon as RVD went for a Five-Star Frog Splash . Brock , though , hoisted Van Dam onto his shoulder and went for the F-5 , but RVD whirled Brock into a DDT and followed with the Frog Splash ! He went for the pin , but Heyman pulled the ref from the ring ! The ref immediately called for a disqualification and soon traded blows with Heyman ! After , RVD leapt onto Brock from the top rope and then threatened to hit the Van Terminator ! Heyman grabbed RVD 's leg and Brock picked up the champ and this time connected with the F-5 onto a steel chair ! Winner : RVD Match 6 : Booker T vs the Big Show Booker T faced the Big Show one-on-one next . Show withstood Booker T 's kicks and punches and slapped Booker into the corner . After being thrown from the ring , Booker picked up a chair at ringside , but Big Show punched it back into Booker 's face . Booker tried to get back into the game by choking Show with a camera cable at ringside . Booker smashed a TV monitor from the Spanish announcers ' position into Show 's skull , then delivered a scissors kick that put both men through the table ! Booker crawled back into the ring and Big Show staggered in moments later . Show grabbed Booker 's throat but was met by a low blow and a kick to the face . Booker climbed the top rope and nailed a somersaulting leg drop to get the pin ! Winner : Booker T Announcement : Triple H entered the ring to a thunderous ovation as fans hoped to learn where The Game would end up competing . Before he could speak , Eric Bishoff stopped The Game to apologize for getting involved in his personal business . If Triple H signed with RAW , Bischoff promised his personal life would never come into play again . Bischoff said he 's spent the past two years networking in Hollywood . He said everyone was looking for the next breakout WWE Superstar , and they were all talking about Triple H . Bischoff guaranteed that if Triple H signed with RAW , he 'd be getting top opportunities coming his way . Stephanie McMahon stepped out to issue her own pitch . She said that because of her personal history with Triple H , the two of them know each other very well . She said the two of them were once unstoppable and they can be again . Bischoff cut her off and begged her to stop . Stephanie cited that Triple H once told her how Bischoff said Triple H had no talent and no charisma . Bischoff said he was young at the time and didn't know what he had , but he still has a lot more experience that Stephanie . The two continued to bicker back and forth , until Triple H stepped up with his microphone . The Game said it would be easy to say " screw you " to either one of them . Triple H went to shake Bischoff 's hand , but pulled it away . He said he would rather go with the devil he knows , rather than the one he doesn't know . Before he could go any further , though , Shawn Michaels came out to shake things up . HBK said the last thing he wanted to do was cause any trouble . He didn't want to get involved , but he remembered pledging to bring Triple H to the nWo . HBK said there 's nobody in the world that Triple H is better friends with . HBK told his friend to imagine the two back together again , making Bischoff 's life a living hell . Triple H said that was a tempting offer . He then turned and hugged HBK , making official his switch to RAW ! Triple H and HBK left , and Bischoff gloated over his victory . Bischoff said the difference between the two of them is that he 's got testicles and she doesn't . Stephanie whacked Bischoff on the side of the head and left ! Match 7 : Tag Team Championship Match Christian and Lance Storm vs Hollywood Hogan and Edge The match started with loud " USA " chants and with Hogan shoving Christian through the ropes and out of the ring . The Canadians took over from there . But Edge scored a kick to Christian 's head and planted a facebuster on Storm to get the tag to Hogan . Hogan began to Hulk up and soon caught Christian with a big boot and a leg drop ! Storm broke up the count and Christian tossed Hogan from the ring where Storm superkicked the icon . Edge tagged in soon after and dropped both opponents . He speared both of them into the corner turnbuckles , but missed a spear on Strom and hit the ref hard instead . Edge nailed a DDT , but the ref was down and could not count . Test raced down and took down Hogan then leveled Edge with a boot . Storm tried to get the pin , but Edge kicked out after two . Riksihi sprinted in to fend off Test , allowing Edge to recover and spear Storm . Christian distracted the ref , though , and Y2J dashed in and clocked Edge with the Tag Team Championship ! Storm rolled over and got the pinfall to win the title ! Winners and New Tag Team Champions : Christian and Lance Storm Match 8 : WWE Undisputed Championship Triple Threat Match . The Rock vs Kurt Angle and the Undertaker Three of WWE 's most successful superstars lined up against each other in a Triple Threat Match with the Undisputed Championship hanging in the balance . Taker and The Rock got face to face with Kurt Angle begging for some attention off to the side . He got attention in the form of a beat down form the two other men . Soon after , Taker spilled out of the ring and The Rock brawled with Angle . Angle gave a series of suplexes that took down Rock , but the Great One countered with a DDT that managed a two-count . The fight continued outside the ring with Taker coming to life and clotheslining Angle and repeatedly smacking The Rock . Taker and Rock got into it back into the ring , and Taker dropped The Rock with a sidewalk slam to get a two-count . Rock rebounded , grabbed Taker by the throat and chokeslammed him ! Angle broke up the pin attempt that likely would have given The Rock the title . The Rock retaliated by latching on the ankle lock to Kurt Angle . Angle reversed the move and Rock Bottomed the People 's Champion . Soon after , The Rock disposed of Angle and hit the People 's Elbow on the Undertaker . Angle tried to take advantage by disabling the Great One outside the ring and covering Taker , who kicked out after a two count . Outside the ring , Rock took a big swig from a nearby water bottle and spewed the liquid into Taker 's face to blind the champion . Taker didn't stay disabled for long , and managed to overpower Rock and turn his attention to Angle . Taker landed a guillotine leg drop onto Angle , laying on the ring apron . The Rock picked himself up just in time to break up a pin attempt on Kurt Angle . Taker nailed Rock with a DDT and set him up for a chokeslam . ANgle tried sneaking up with a steel chair , but Taker caught on to that tomfoolery and smacked it out of his hands . The referee got caught in the ensuing fire and didn't see Angle knock Taker silly with a steel chair . Angle went to cover Taker as The Rock lay prone , but the Dead Man somehow got his shoulder up . Angle tried to pin Rock , but he too kicked out . The Rock got up and landed Angle in the sharpshooter ! Angle looked like he was about to tap , but Taker kicked The Rock out of the submission hold . Taker picked Rock up and crashed him with the Last Ride . While the Dead Man covered him for the win , Angle raced in and picked Taker up in the ankle lock ! Taker went delirious with pain , but managed to counter . He picked Angle up for the last ride , but Angle put on a triangle choke ! It looked like Taker was about to pass out , but The Rock broke Angle 's hold only to find himself caught in the ankle lock . Rock got out of the hold and watched Taker chokeslam Angle . Rocky hit the Rock Bottom , but Taker refused to go down and kicked out . Angle whirled Taker up into the Angle Slam but was Rock Bottomed by the Great One and pinned ! Winner and New WWE Champion : The Rock ~ Finally there is a decent PPV ! Lately the PPV weren't very good , but this one was a winner . I give this PPV a A-  
  " Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but Europeans did , and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines " . - It is obvious that the person who wrote this comment hasn't understood the reasoning behind this documentary or the original book . Please don't ruin this great piece by your simple mindedness . The reasons are far more complex than the single thing you mentioned . Please read the book as is it a great source of information . I enjoyed it a lot . This book is even a taught as a text book at some universities .  
  Having read Diamond 's book , I was slightly disappointed in the series , but all in all , it is quite informative . Reading the other comments , it is comforting to know that the ' culture warriors ' are hard at work , seeing ' attacks ' on ' Western Civilization ' under every rug . Is Diamond a little preachy ? Sure . Like a lot of academics , he sees his theory as the most important thing ever . He uses the phrase ' guns , germs , and steel ' at seemingly every opportunity during the series . We get it , after about the first 10 minutes . Is Diamond a little simplistic ( in the series ) ? Sure . The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly amusing , condensing some very long , complicated history down to ' smallpox , swords , and horses ' , wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes . But the point remains valid - these things did in fact contribute ( but not totally define ) the reasons for the Spaniard 's success against the established cultures . Is he preaching * against * Western Civilization in any way ? Nope . Not a word . Not to my ear . All he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly , * not * that luck is the only reason . In the end , if you 're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority , then this series is not for you . But if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail , this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence .  
  I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival . I 've always been a fan of classic horror films and especially the gimmicks of William Castle , so this was definitely a must-see for me . This is about the life and work of William Castle , who in my opinion was an underrated director . True , he made some cheap budget schlocky horror films , but he added something to these films : real live theater gimmicks that you don't see anymore . For example , he had nurses in case someone had a heart attack at his movies and put vibrators at the bottoms of chairs in THE TINGLER . This is truly a well-made documentary and brings this rather shadowed director into the light , and celebrated his contributions to horror cinema . It also paints Castle as a larger than life character , who was very well-liked and had a smile on his face . Unlike most film documentaries that mostly show testaments from film historians , SPINE TINGLER ! shows interviews mostly from his family members and directors who were influenced by his work , such as John Waters , John Landis , and Joe Dante . A must see for classic horror and sci-fi fans .  
  Full House is a great family show . However , after watching some episodes over and over again I 've realized that they 're incredibly boring and they seem to shelter themselves from the outside world a lot . Yes , there is a lot of comedy , but there are times when it 's incredibly cheesy . It 's not like I hate it , but just don't watch them over and over again because they get old quick . Probably the best season is the first . Full House is about widower Danny Tanner ( Bob Saget ) and his three daughters D.J. ( Candace Cameron ) Stephanie ( Jodie Sweetin ) and Michelle ( Mary-Kate and Ashley ) . When Danny 's wife dies the he is in need of some help . So , his best friend Joey ( Dave Coulier ) and the girls ' Uncle Jesse ( John Stamos ) moves in with them . Once they live there together they find they can't live without each other . Full House reminds you just how important family is and that you can always go home again .  
  I watched ' Speak Easily ' one night and thought it was o . k . , but missing something . Maybe Buster Keaton strangely speaking threw me off , or the labored line delivery of a leading lady . The next day I kept thinking about the movie , though . I couldn't get Durante 's song out of my head , I kept trying to better remember Thelma Todd 's first scene , I considered that maybe Keaton did do some funny falls and physical comedy . The next night I watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal . A very funny scene , the actors excellent , their faces , their eyes , their silly expressions . So I watched another scene , their show is opening on Broadway . Buster in his blissful innocence botches every act . Again , I was laughing out loud , appreciating Keaton 's clowning and tumbling . So the next night I watched the whole movie again , and this time I see it for the first time : It 's Stupendous ! It 's Sensational ! It 's Sublime ! Three great comedians ! Todd dances ! Durante sings ! Keaton speaks ! Sure it ain't poifect .. but there 's a lot of laughs in this picture .  
  I saw it at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning . I 'm going to assume that one 's level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one 's level of acceptance of Joseph 's story . However , that aside it was very well made , well acted , and had a nice score . If you get to Salt Lake City , it is a must to see it in the Legacy Theater . I have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality , sound quality and ambiance in my entire life .. I wonder if the Church would let me watch Batman Begins there ! Being that I 'm LDS and regard Joseph as a prophet , I was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times .. which I presume is expected since they handed out tissues BEFORE the movie started ! Anyway , I 'm told that this film is available in several LDS Visitor Centers around the globe , if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe Joseph Smith or not , he tells a fascinating story .  
  Well-done ghost story that will give you the creeps and some pretty fair scares along the way . The story unfolds slowly , building atmosphere all the way until you 're ready to see the woman in black . You won't forget her once you 've seen her . No gore , no knives , no hockey masks-just a well-constructed story that is best viewed at night with the lights out .  
  This was a typical grade B movie in 1940s Hollywood and yet it succeeded way beyond its expectations . Why ? It has a wonderful plot and backed up by Nina Foch , George MacReady and Dame May Witty , as a female villain , of all people . When a young lady answers an advertisement for a secretary , she certainly gets more than she bargained for . The only talents her employers are seeking are those which will lead to her demise . Seems that Witty and MacReady want to pass her off as their daughter-in-law and wife , respectively . MacReady killed his real wife and wants to do Foch in as well so that a body can be claimed . The film deals with how Foch tries to get town people to believe her and how she is thwarted in practically everything she does . Why don't people believe her ?  
  When I first started watching this anime I never thought that something about making bread could actually be interesting , but thankfully I was mistaken . From the moment I started watching it , anime just pulled into the world of bread making , I was hooked . The biggest advantage of this anime is it 's humor , which is very intelligent and very funny , with some recurring gags . But the animation , soundtrack and character development are below average , while these disadvantages aren't seen so much in the first episodes , because of the great job on this anime , it really starts to show in the last 20 episodes , when the reactions and recurring gags just grow old , and aren't as funny as before . As far as I 'm concerned , if this anime had ended with episode 52 I would have given it a 9 , but the last episodes just leave a bitter aftertaste , which sadly can't be washed away by the awesome 50 episodes . 7/10  
  This movie does contradict the first one as far as the origins of the Care Bears and the Care Bear Cousins goes . I won't deny that . However , if you look at " Part II " as a separate film , then it 's a very good movie . I remember watching this in the early 80 's ( and fitting into its targeted demographic audience then ) , and absolutely loving it much more than the first movie ( not that I didn't enjoy that one too , it 's just that this one seemed to have a little something extra to it ) . Sure it 's darker than the first one too , but perhaps maybe that 's why it 's so good . And it 's dark in deeper kind of subtle way too ( that kids may not fully understand , but could still be a bit scared of because of the atmosphere it gives off , and adults watching will surely get quicker as I have now watching this film again now in my mid-twenties ) where you basically have a young girl making a deal with an evil spirit / demon in exchange for something else . Get the picture ? But simply watching that as a child , sure as I said it may have been a little scary , but nothing traumatizing . In fact if anything it gave me another fantasy game I could play when I was that age . I can't tell you the number of times I used to pretend Dark Heart wanted to imprison me , have me help him capture the Care Bears , tried to make me turn over to his dark side , and other things like that etc . So this movie was also good for my imagination . And it 's also got great emotional depth to it too . I used to watch it at least once a week . Also Hadley Kay was the perfect choice for the voice of Dark Heart ( I always thought so and I always will ) . Now it 's just too bad that they never made a soundtrack available . Sometimes I just want to hear Growing Up without watching the movie , as good as it is . " What good is love and caring if it can't save her ? "  
  I saw this movie once on late night t . v . and knew it was the best movie ever . This is one of the few Kung-Fu movies with a decent plot . The progression of the main character is seamless . The whole movie is great !  
  I searched for this movie for years , apparently it ain't available here in the States so bought me a copy off Ebay . Four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the woods searching for a bear that apparently has killed several campers . What they find is an ex-Vietnam vet gone crazy ( he kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal finger nails a la Freddy Krueger ) . As soon as the night falls , one of the girls goes for a walk after a brief argument with her boyfriend , she gets killed . After one of the group finds her body , they all hide in their tents waiting for daylight . Once the sun comes up , all of them try and make it out , but fall victim one by one . Seven bodies , not a lot of gore , but a couple of good murders , especially the girls'deaths . The guys get killed in somewhat bloodless ways ( blown up in car , shot to death , knife through head ) . Overall , INFERNAL TRAP is a nice slasher film from the late 80 's . Nothing new , just well acted , fast paced and some pretty ladies . 10 out of 10 .  
  Could not understand why Jeremy Irons felt it necessary to exhibit a most disconcerting accent , spoken through clenched teeth , and from the back of his throat . In fact it rather spoiled the film for me , and distracted from what was probably a fine performance by him ( very irritating ) . No other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent and whilst I have always rated Jeremy Irons as a fine actor , I would not class this film as being one of his best . The film however has whetted my appetite , as have some of the other comments made re this film , which I have found very interesting , and intend to now read the book .  
  This 1991 NBC-TV movie aired six months before John Goodman 's big-screen version of the life of Babe Ruth came out . For my money , there is no comparison between the two . The TV production isn't perfect but it presents the Babe 's story with more depth and complexity than Goodman 's one-dimensional telling . I especially enjoyed the film 's depiction of the complex love-hate relationship Ruth had with Yankee manager Miller Huggins , who always understood his star player 's brilliance and also kept trying to point out why Ruth 's own character flaws would never let him become a manager or leader of players . The TV-movie rightly notes how Ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the Yankees because of his flaws , while the horrible Goodman version tries to push the falsehood that Ruth was denied what should have been his for the taking . This film makes a great companion piece to " Eight Men Out " since the story starts with Ruth 's arrival in New York in 1920 , one year after the Black Sox Scandal and when his home run exploits literally saved baseball from ruin . Indeed , the continuity between the two films is even accentuated with John Anderson reprising his " Eight Men Out " role as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis .  
  This is an excellent film , and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings , as it is unavailable on video / DVD . The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving , and ends with them leaving ( although quite a lot happens in between , and they don't stay in one place during this time ) , gives you a sense of closure , and a feeling that all is right with the world . If you get a chance to see this film , then do . I can't wait to see it again , and wish that it could be put on general release .  
  This version of Anna Christie is in German . Greta Garbo again plays Anna Christie , but all of the other characters have different actors from the English version . Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany . Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version over the English version . It 's a good tale and a must-see for Garbo fans .  
  Just read the original story which is written by Pu in 18th century . Strikingly , the movie despict the original spirit very well , though the plot was modified tremendously . The film language , the rhythm , the special effect are all from hollywood , but still there is a chinese core . It is amazing how Hark Tsui managed to combine them together . The result is pure beauty .  
  Artistically speaking , this is a beautiful movie-the cinematography , music and costumes are gorgeous . In fact , this movie is prettier than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself . In this case , he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death . So , as far as the writing goes , the dialog was well-written and the story , at times , was interesting . However , the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some ways-after all , it 's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel . It 's interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan , the women STILL long for a better life . This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame , though Streets Of Shame 's characters are a lot less likable and more one-dimensional . So , overall it gets a 7-mostly due to everything BUT the writing . It 's too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story by the great Kurasawa .  
  This was a highly original decent movie , and a brave move for all those involved . I don't care if it 's not the most well put-together movie of all time , the fact that it has Eddie Murphy doing something non-formulaic , and that I don't know what will happen next , makes it a favorite of mine . I wish more movies were as imaginative as this one , rather than the same old formula for entertainment .  
  Normally , I don't watch action movies because of the fact that they are usually all pretty similar . This movie did have many stereotypical action movie scenes , but the characters and the originality of the film 's premise made it much easier to watch . David Duchovny bended his normal acting approach , which was great to see . Angelina Jolie , of course , was beautiful and did great acting . Great cast all together . A must see for people bored with the same old action movie .  
  While the main story is supposed to take place in Morocco , this movie was shot in foggy Romania in 18 days on a very tight budget . However broken their cards may be , the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and commitment , so that in the end I found the result both touching and graceful . Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau provides a formidable performance as the bad guy . The script and direction provide some gems . Whether you will like the movie or not , however , will probably depend on your take on Alexandra Staden in the title role . Other reviewers have pointed out Staden 's inadequacies as Modesty Blaise . They may have a point , but I found her interpretation delightful and very fitting . Modesty manages to overcome terrible odds through discipline , innate talent and courage . Staden appears to be doing the same here .  
  Unfortunately many consumers who write reviews for IMDb equate low budget with not good . Whatever else this movie might need , more budget really isn't part of it . Big sets and lots of special effects would have turned it into another Lara Croft movie . What we have here is a step or two better than that . The nearly unknown Alexandra Staden is captivating as the enigmatic Modesty , and this is crucial for this movie to work . Her wise little smiles and knowing looks are formidable , and you find yourself wishing that the camera won't leaver her face . It makes it workable that the bad guy Nikolai , played by also little known ( in the U.S. at least ) Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau might take an unusually cerebral interest in her , something Modesty can exploit . She is able to divert his raping her with just a shove and spitting out " stop wasting my time ! " then storming off between his heavily armed yet suddenly diffident henchmen . Making a scene like that plausible doesn't happen by accident . Probably the biggest problem I have with the rail-thin Staden playing Modesty is it just isn't very believable for her to go hand to hand with an athletic and muscled looking guy like Coaster-Waldau and beat him . She just ain't a Peta Wilson or a pumped-up Hilary Swank type actress who can throw a convincing punch . Coaster-Waldau letting himself be overpowered by Staden looks like he 's just roughhousing with his little sister . Since this is not really an action film , this isn't a big flaw . I just hope they do better on that if and when they make sequels .  
  this movie has a great message , a impressive cast , ellen burstyn , samantha mathis , jodelle ferland ( was 4 years old when she made this movie ) ellen burstyn and jodelle ferland have both been nominated for best actress in a tv drama at the up-coming emmy awards in new york , peter masterson-director - has been nominated best director tv drama at the emmy awards also . april 1 , 2001 , jodelle ferland ' Won ' , best actress in a tv drama , at the young artist awards , in studio city , ca . i can see why they have 3 nominations . mermaid is a true story , during the cridits they have the real family on the set , something you don't see often . you can find mermaid at all blockbuster video stores . do watch it , you 'll be glad you did .  
  I always feel strange and guilty saying it ( because I 'm a fairly well-educated non-teenager ) , but I actually sort of like the Olsen twins , and I respect the movies they make , even though I 've never really been their target audience . " When in Rome " was a traditional Mary-Kate and Ashley movie , complete with the foreign travel , accents , motorbikes , adult romance as a " B " storyline , fashion orientation , and even the gag reel over the credits . I enjoyed myself . " When in Rome " and the other Olsen twin movies never pretend to be anything they 're not ; most of the time , they only premiere on video , and they never claim to be the next " Citizen Kane " or even " An Affair to Remember . " My point is , people who watch this movie and expect it to be anything other than another Olsen twin movie will be disappointed . That said , those who ARE fans of the Olsen twins will really enjoy themselves . For those of us who 've watched them since the first episodes of " Full House , " it 's really great to see them growing into more mature roles . This movie provides important historical and geographical information , just like many of their other movies ( remember 10 Downing Street from " Winning London " and the visit to the Louvre from " Passport to Paris " ? ) as well as providing good , clean fun that can be enjoyed by the whole family . As long as I still feel like I 'm on my soapbox , and as long as I can make it relevant to the movie , let me take a moment to challenge those who reject the Olsen twins : in order to be a fan of the Olsen twins , you don't have to be some pre-teen " valley girl " from California . In fact , that 's not really the target audience . If it were , the MK & A fashion line of clothes and accessories would be run through Gap or some store like that , not Wal-Mart . " When in Rome , " while it does feature " high fashion " and globe-trotting and two girls from a valley in Cali , isn't really ABOUT that .. it 's more about inspiring young girls who have initiative to let it take them places . If that means setting the movie in some glamorous foreign city with cute guys on motorbikes , so be it . That 's called marketing-you take an idea and sell it by making it appealing . At least they 're sending a good message , even if the means seem a little superficial . Basically , don't knock the film until you 've seen it , and then don't knock it until you 've tried to understand what the Olsen twins do : they encourage young girls to be creative , intuitive , and driven young women . This movie does that , I think , just like their others . Kids - enjoy . Parents - do the same . If you like the Olsen twins , you won't be disappointed .  
  Ed Harris 's work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence , that is , he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it , and that includes the formidable Sean Connery . The movie , which is more than a bit sanctimonious , comes alive only in the scenes when Harris is interrogated by the attorney for another convict . It is breathtaking , a master class in artistic control . The other cast members are all adept and Connery is reliable , as is Fishbourne , but the story itself packs no wallop . The plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be mistreated and coerced by white law enforcement officers . This is the engine which drives the story , right or wrong , and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end . Still , worth watching to see Harris in action .  
  Lars Von Trier is never backward in trying out new techniques . Some of them are very original while others are best forgotten . He depicts postwar Germany as a nightmarish train journey . With so many cities lying in ruins , Leo Kessler a young American of German descent feels obliged to help in their restoration . It is not a simple task as he quickly finds out . His uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the Zentropa Railway Line . His job is to attend to the needs of the passengers . When the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles . A terrible argument ensues when a passenger 's shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished . There are many allusions to the German fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details . The railway journey is like an allegory representing man 's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations . In one sequence Leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with half-starved bodies appearing to have just escaped from Auschwitz . These images , horrible as they are , are fleeting as in a dream , each with its own terrible impact yet unconnected . At a station called Urmitz Leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb . In view of many by-standers he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage . He returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock . Later he jumps from the train ( at high speed ) and lies in the cool grass on a river bank . Looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy . Subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock . If you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task . Quite ridiculous in fact . It could only happen in a dream . It 's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the train . Despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed , I prefer Lars Von Trier 's later films ( Breaking the Waves and The Idiots ) . The bomb scene described above really put me off . Perhaps I 'm a realist .  
  The film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete . The idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture that we are bathed in . Naturally , the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County . He attacks stand up comics ( caw , caw , caw ) , rock bands , models , blockbuster Hollywood films , and touches on many other mediums . Eventually , he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion . The film is five years old and rings more true every day . It 's the best description of post-punk anger I 've ever seen . It 's also one of my top 10 favorite films .  
  First of all the movie , is an ingenious work of art ( movie ) . The plot was filled with surprises , a little kid pretends to be a grown up inherits one million dollars and how he spends it . I mean how whacked out is this . Walt Disney really outdid themselves this time . The comedy is most of the times expected but the other times unexpected . I mean was this movie OK or was this movie OK . It also teaches a lot about wise youths and I this kid is really wise and a bit time smart pants . But also it sucks . How the heck could a guy like that kid get a hot police babe and his dad let him go free . That 's like let a killer get bailed free for ten years . If I were to do that I 'd get beaten with a ' suble jack ' ( a huge stick that stings when used to bench your butts really hard ) . That kid is really lucky . Back to the story . The movie makers really knew what they were doing when they made this movie but still it 's not perfect . The acting was good and bad . The kid and woman had no chemistry neither did the father but the bros were excellent ' . The special effects on the other hand was lame . Plus this movie isn't based on reality . I hated and loved it at the same time .  
  Faithful adaptation of witty and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressed middle-aged software engineer ( or something ) , relying heavily on first-person narration but none the worse for that . Downbeat ( in a petit-bourgeois sort of way ) , philosophical and blackly humorous , the best way I could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual Charles Bukowski ( no disrespect to CB intended ) . Mordantly funny , but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations , the film 's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask : why aren't other films like this ? One of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film .  
  How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad , scary and life-affirming . It ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen , even though you were hoping-maybe even beleiving-it wouldn't . Utlimately , this is the film 's greatest strength : it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations , then drops a bomb on you . I saw this in a film theory class at USC back in the mid-'90s . It is not easy to find , but is definitely worth hunting for .  
  Thank the Lord for Martin Scorsese , and his love of the movies . This is the perfect introduction into the mind of the most talented American artist working in cinema today , and I couldn't recommend it more . I was enthralled through the whole thing and you will be too . Just relax and let him take you on a ride through his world , you 'll love it .  
  The cast is different and now they took a different approach we have the street smart team " Networth " vs . the supposed professional team " Magna " but boy if you think the street smart team would have trouble you 'd be right . While the Magna team has struggled at times , the street team has simply disintegrated week after week . First some things to reiterate as far as the " Apprentice 3 " first of it continues the same absurd mentality ( from Trump ) and the game in this series : if your a good project manager , but you lose , the team will turn on you and you will be fired , despite the fact that your backstabbing teammates are often the ones who do half ass jobs . Simply absurd , that a game show that claims to hire the best candidate actually " weeds " out the best while the dysfunctional candidates stab each other until one is left and that person is the best . lol Anyone this season , weve seen a total of cursing , backstabbing and even gay offensive stereotypes carried out as teams try to do campaigns . The list of victims so far Cast Tara Dowdell , Audrey Evans , Danny Kastner those three are the only that I feel were unfairly fired by Trump , the rest really had it coming as they only incited conflict , anger and suffering . It 's just amazing as one candidate Audrey Evans said as how she who did a good job was fired and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game . Yes its the game , it 's " The Apprentice " where manipulation , backstabbing , and always popular " everyone gang up on the project manager " mentality rules . It has been an entertaining ride , though , the candidates are given a wide array of assignments from photo shoots to the construction of mini golf courses , to building of new apartments . Still though it 's still the " Apprentice " though so all you can do basically is laugh the whole time as the insanity and chaos insues until lucky person is the winner .  
  Wow what an episode ! After last week seeing Mellisa constantly making cameos about the friendship of Annie and Brandi I almost puked . But that was nothing until seeing Mellisa 's tirade after being fired . Seeing her hobble around on her cast spewing out obscenities and screaming for someone to get her purse was absolutely the most hilarious thing ever on reality TV . She continued to scream at people off set to get her clothes " all of them " like someone else would wear one of her hideous outfits . Mellisa you are like 40 years old and you still throw temper tantrums ? Then Joan starts calling Annie and Brandie every name in the book , and gets up and quits the show ! Both Rivers are spoiled brats who were only left on the show this long to keep ratings up . Mellisa crying and refusing to do an exit interview , just proves to America what everyone thought , you are a spoiled baby . WAH WAH I can't get my way ! I love how Annie told the cameras she could manipulate Mellisa to think her way , and then did exactly that . Mellisa is by far the smartest contestant and clearly deserves to win the whole game .  
  This movie is brilliant . The comments made before is from someone who obviously doesn't get it . The movie is campy - yes ! But it is uplifting and fun . This movie is an underground hit and brings comparisons to Absolutely Fabulous . It is a must see !  
  Why on earth should you explore the mesmerizing nature documentary " Earth " ? How much time do you have on earth so I can explain this to you ? OK , I will not elongate my review exploration on " Earth " to infinity , but I must stand my ground on why this is a " must see " . The documentary takes a nature round trip on the migration paths on three animal families : a female polar bear and her cubs with the real life subplot of the father bear daring it out to hunt for food in his isolated path , a mama of a whale with her baby whale taking a whale of a migration tour for prey , and an elephant mama with her small ( maybe not so small , they are elephants ) offspring migrating in Africa . Directors Alastair Forthegill & Mark Linfield did an " out of this earth " job in also capturing the survival skills of many other animal species besides the magnetic shots of our three animal family protagonists . The cinematographically skilled team of Richard Brooks Burton , Mike Holding , Adam Ravetch , and Andrew Shillabeer were animales in camera shooting the wondrous nature sites and animal instinctive behaviors ; not to mention , the slo-mo animal prey shots were u n b e l i e a v a b l e . " Earth " is also a lesson learner on the global warming effect on the animals ; the papa polar bear in the doc is the poster animal boy on that consequence . So fellow earthlings , it is time to take the documentary voyage to visit " Earth " today ! * Good  
  In 2006 , the AMPAS awarded one of the most innovative documentaries depicting wildlife in the coldest place on Earth , that film was March of the Penguins narrated by Academy Award Winning Actor Morgan Freeman . Walt Disney Studios has had a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades now . They 've taken their stabs at live action film making and it 's been hit and miss all across the board . Disney then created a sub-division called Disneynature and release its first feature film titled Earth . This is absolutely one of the most touching and informative documentaries I 've seen in quite sometime . Narrated by the great James Earl Jones , Earth doesn't offer anything new to anyone who has watched the Discovery Channel in the past five years or follows the Global Warming crisis very closely . Earth touches very deeply on the issue and takes a very liberal approach on the subject matter . It enables an emotional connection to nature that I haven't experienced before . It also shows not only the beauty and mystifying parts of our gorgeous planet , but the grunt and disturbing aspects that it often entails . It 's one thing to watch " Mufasa " fall from a cliff in to a stampede or Bambi 's mother be shot by a hunter in the middle of the woods . It 's all good because at the end of the film we know it is , just that , a film . This shows penguins , polar bears , elephants , all types of families , from all walks of life , living and dying in their natural habitats . These real things make a real movie experience . Though a bit heavy-weight on the graphic nature of the film ( which many people will disagree ) , Earth is a touching experience . There is stunning cinematography work here by a great camera team and an amazing score by George Fenton . In comparison to March of the Penguins or Grizzly Man , it doesn't really hold any measure but it stands great on its own . At the end of the day , you grow an appreciation of our planet and a bit of sadness as many of us will probably never get to visit these places we 'll witness in the film . We live here yet it 's like we never get to explore the planet for one reason or another . Earth is beautiful . * / *  
  The film concerns a classic theme . In fact it concerns the theme exploited by Batman , from beginning to end , but in real data and details . The mayor of New York , appreciated and very diligent and dynamic , in order to get some project through slightly faster than normal , yields to some pressure from some private business contractors about a criminal drug dealer who should have been sent and kept in prison and he pressurizes the judge in his turn to set him free on probation in spite of a negative probation report that disappears but is not destroyed , be it only because of the political value it represents . And what was to happen happens and a few people , including a black schoolboy is killed in a shoot out between a police detective and that criminal . The city may explode because of it : racial tension because of the black school boy and social tension because of the insecurity such criminals free to roam around and go on with their criminal activities represent to the public . Unluckily the film does not show that tension very well and follows the investigation of the first deputy mayor who wants to find out the truth and does find it out . But along the way a few witnesses are killed , and those who had played some role in the whole business are forced to retire ( the judge ) , to end their career and life ( the contractor or the contractor 's go between ) , a public officer who was ready to deliver the disappeared probation report , and some shady character after he provides some crucial information . The mayor himself retires and takes a long vacation ; But the main interest of the film is in the exploration of the contortions the mayor is doing to cover up the problem and the contortions he remembers having done in the past that led to the mistake about this probation case . The political philosophy that nothing is pure white or pure black and that everything is grey which is never comfortable to decision makers is invoked as an excuse for wrong but profitable decisions . We are not speaking of necessary compromises to get to some consensus in some domains that are crucial to public interest . We are speaking of considering as less important to take a bad decision about some petty or supposedly petty criminal than some infrastructure or economic project in the city . That is not typical of New York . That is true in any mayoral office . It is just more significant in quantity and in quality in a big metropolitan area like New York and of course in a city or country where police departments are municipal and are controlled by political imperatives . The young deputy mayor is thus pushing the old mayor out of the way , and he derails his ambition to be the governor of New York in order to become the president of the US . The mayor is perfect due to the embodiment Al Pacino offers us since he is able to express ten minutes of dialogue with one facial expression that makes the whole dialogue useless . I find the end slightly mushy with the ex-deputy mayor campaigning in his own name . That seems to mean that he was so attached to justice because he saw his chance to push the mayor out of his own way . Hence he is not better than all the others , just still too young in his ambition .

  This movie is good for what it is , and unpretentious ; I wouldn't watch it twice , however : I am a Peter Cushing completist and that 's why I watched it . The best asset of this movie is : BREVITY and EFFECTIVENESS . Compared to other similar movies , it does NOT drag its feet forever as each of the four ( plus one ) segments lasts under 30 minutes , with the last under 10 . Good uncanny vibes . In the first segment , horror writer suffering from ' writer 's block ' relocates to secluded old house seeking inspiration . He finds even too much of it when he starts to visualize one of his fictional madmen . Plot contrivance similar to PREMATURE BURIAL . Good use of the point-of-view twist : is the writer getting mentally ill .. or ( as the ending shows ) his trophy wife wants her lover to play along with the husband 's phobias to drive him mad & secure his estates .. yet will the scheming bimbo survive to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan ? In the second segment two long time lost friends get together in the same secluded old house but cannot seem to help visiting a bizarre horror museum featuring the wax statue of the long lost love of their youth , which had once separated them . From the Gothic museum keeper they learn the woman portrayed is a deceased ax wielding murderer .. or was she ? The third segment was the less interesting to me . The fourth shows a horror movies actor - who thinks he 's the best of all - sunken to the depths of low budget C movies . Seeking a costume to lend more credibility to his fictional vampire , he gets the real deal . This segment also lacks the solidity of the first two . Acting is fair , with the 2 initial segments contributing the bulk of it . Good movie , taken with a grain of salt . Not the best Cushing , nor Lee .. but worth watching .  
  Featuring a few of Hammer 's all-stars , this highly effective slice of British horror revolves around a house and the fates of it 's previous tenants , whose stories are all told to a Scotland yard detective , in search of a missing actor . Story number one , which is probably the least impressive of the four , deals with a writer and his wife who 've just moved in the house and plan to stay just for a short time so that he may write one of his horror novels . He creates a demented character named Dominic , who 's a very creepy looking strangler , and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this beastly looking man everywhere he goes . After his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help , a sub-plot is introduced which frankly , didn't really work for me . I won't spoil it for you . The next story ( the best in my opinion ) stars the wonderful Peter Cushing as Philip Grayson , a man who 's moved into the home for his retirement years and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museum ( that deals in the macabre ) where he 's very startled to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past . Soon thereafter , an old friend ( who also has a history with this woman ) is in town for business and drops by to see him . The two men are in for a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eye . Story three stars one of my very favorites .. Christopher Lee , who plays John Reid . After moving into the home with his peculiar daughter Jane , the nanny that he hires becomes awfully suspicious as to the way Reid suppresses his daughter . Well come to find out .. if she knew what Lee did , she would have certainly understood . The final story is a rather light-hearted vampire tale that stars John Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt . After buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant , actor Paul Henderson finds himself turning into the very creature that he 's portrayed several times in his career . Overall , the pacing and direction were very good , as was the most of the performances . There were nice Gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the ambiance . This one 's a keeper , and comes highly recommended .  
  Old People Show ? I 'm 15 and have been watching the show since I was 12 , recoding it onto my Sky + box everyday from Hallmark and BBC 1 . I really wish they hadn't cancelled it , they didn't even get a proper farewell . But what an adventure , all those episodes , I think I 've seen them all , and not one comes to mind that I didn't like and enjoy . Its a shame the BBC keep swapping between Diagnoses Murder and ' Murder She Wrote '- Never watched it and don't intend to . Anyways , he characters in Diagnoses Murder are so in-depth , and the chemistry between the actors is amazing . It really was a sad day when they cancelled this show ..  
  I love this show as it action packed with adventure , love and intrigue . Well some times love ! It 's so good see a show where all the characters work well together and they treat each other with respect . It 's also very good to se Dick Van Dyke in a television role as I have only seen him in Mary Poppins . the mixture of the main characters , Mark , Amanda , Jesse and Steve is very capturing to the audience . This is a show you have to watch !  
  Berlin-born in 1942 Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer . She has been described , perhaps even unfairly caricatured , as a director whose commitment to bringing a woman 's sensibility to the screen outweighs her artistic strengths . " Rosenstrasse , " which has garnered mixed and even strange reviews ( the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews I 've ever read in that paper ) is not a perfect film . It is a fine movie and a testament to a rare coalescing of successful opposition to the genocidal Nazi regime by , of all peoples , generically powerless Germans demonstrating in a Berlin street . Co-writer von Trotta uses the actual Rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman 's search for information about her mother 's never disclosed life as a child in the German capital during World War II . The husband of Ruth Weinstein ( Jutta Lampe ) has died and in a surprising reversion to an orthodox Jewish lifestyle apparently hitherto in long abeyance , Ruth not only " sits shivah " ( the Jews ' week-long mourning ritual ) but she insists on following the strict proscriptions of her faith . Her apartment in New York City reflects the affluence secured by her deceased spouse 's labors . Her American-born daughter , Hannah ( Maria Schrader ) and her brother are a bit put-off by mom 's assumption of restrictive orthodox Jewish practices but they pitch in . The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah 's fiance , a non-Jew named Luis ( Fedja van Huet ) . A domestic crisis might well erupt as Ruth warns that she 'll disown Hannah if she doesn't give up doting , handsome Luis . Stay tuned . A cousin arrives to pay her respects and also drops clues to an interested Hannah about a wartime mystery about mom 's childhood in Berlin . Hannah is intrigued - she queries her mom who resolutely refuses to discuss that part of her life . This is very , very realistic . I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I knew many children whose families , in whole but usually in part , escaped the Holocaust . Those days were simply not discussed . So Hannah , having learned that a German gentile woman saved Ruth 's life , traipses off to Berlin hoping to find the savior still breathing . Were she not , this would have been a very short film . But Ruth , pretending to be a historian , locates 90 year-old Lena Fischer ( Doris Schade ) , now a widow . As the happy to be interviewed but shaken up by repressed memories Lena tells her story , the scenes shift fairly seamlessly between present day Berlin and the war-time capital . The young Lena of 1943 ( Katja Riemann ) was a fine pianist married to a Jewish violinist , Fabian Fischer ( Martin Feifel ) . With the advent of the Nazi regime he was required to use " Israel " as a middle name just as Jewish women had to add " Sarah " to their names ( incidentally I wish IMDb had not given Fabian 's name on its characters list with the false " Israel " included-it simply perpetuates a name applied by Nazis as a mark of classification and degradation ) . While Germany deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps , those married to " Aryans " were exempted . For a time . Until 1943 when the regime decided to take them too ( most were men ; a minority were Jewish women married to non-Jews ) . The roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity . The young Lena tries to locate her husband . All she and many other women know is that they 're confined in a building on Rosenstrasse . The crowd of anxious women builds up , some piteously seeking help from German officers who predictably refuse aid and also verbally abuse them ( " Jew-loving whore " being one appellation ) . As a subplot Lena more or less adopts eight-year-old Ruth who hid when her mother was seized ( remember , Ruth is now sitting shiva in Manhattan ) . The child Ruth is fetchingly portrayed by Svea Lohde . Through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail . The men , and a handful of women , are released . As in the real story the Nazis gave in , one of the rare , almost unprecedented times when the madmen acknowledged defeat in their homicidal agenda ( another was the termination of the euthanasia campaign to rid the Reich of mental defectives and chronic invalids but that 's another story ) . Von Trotta builds up the tension and each woman 's story is both personal and universal . Hannah continues to prod the aging Lena who slowly , one gathers , begins to suspect she 's not dealing with an ordinary historian but rather someone with a need to learn about the girl she rescued , the child whose mother was murdered . The contrasts between Rosenstrasse of 1943 , a set , and the street today in a bustling , rebuilt , unified Berlin provide a recurring thematic element . Today 's Berlin bears the heritage but not the scars of a monstrous past . Von Trotta makes that point very well . The main actors are uniformly impressive . Lena 's husband while strong is also shown as totally helpless in the snare of confinement with a likely outlook of deportation ( which is shown to have been clearly understood by all characters - including the local police and military - as a one-way trip to oblivion ) . The older Ruth is catalytically forced to confront demons long suppressed in her happy New York life . Hannah is very believable as a young woman whose father 's death triggers a need to discover her family 's past . These things happen ( although the Times 's critic appears not to know that ) . Von Trotta 's hand is sure but not perfect . A scene with Goebbels at a soiree enjoying Lena 's violin playing is unnecessary and distractive . The suggestion that she may have gone to bed with the propaganda minister , the most fanatical top-level Hitler worshiper , to save her husband detracts from the wondrous accomplishment of the demonstrating spouses and relatives . Most of the German officers come from central casting and are molded by the Erich von Stroheim " copy and paste " school of Teutonic nastiness . But that 's understandable . The Rosenstrasse story has been the subject of books and articles and some claim it 's a paradigm case for arguing that many more Jews could have been saved had more Germans protested . Unfortunately that argument is nonsense . The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deeply and understandably self-interested . Most Germans were located on a line somewhere between passive and virulent anti-Semitism . THAT 'S why the Rosenstrasse protest was virtually singular . Whether one buys or rejects the Goldenhagen thesis that most Germans were willing accomplices of the actual murderers it just can not be denied that pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism erupted into a virulent strain from 1933 on . The elderly Lena remarks that what was accomplished by the women was " a ray of light " in an evil time . Most of the men and women sprung from a near death trip survived the war . So " a ray of light " it was and von Trotta 's movie is a beacon of illumination showing that some were saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life saved an occasion for celebration exists . And always will . 9/10  
  Blonde and Blonder has Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene and if you want more from a movie you 're being utterly unreasonable . It feels like a late era Carry On , when the series was no longer blazing trails , but was still more funny than not , think Behind or England and you won't be too far off the mark . Pamela and Denise are bubbly , charming and clearly aware this isn't a masterpiece they 're making , although you can give me it over lots of things I 'm told to like . The supporting cast are energetic , even if some of them aren't particularly good ; I can't see a couple of duff turns in a movie that 's already practically forgotten making much difference to anything , so just smile . I really do think Blonde and Blonder is ace and I hope you hate me for it .  
  Misfits at a military school ? Hmm , sounds funny , maybe offensive to some . You have the characters there , the Arab thief , the sex crazy teen , the smart mouth , the pot smoker , and not to forget , the guy who burns things . Throw in a strict no nonsense Sergent , a homosexual Sergent and one sexy ammunition teacher and it makes one crazy film adventure . I have seen this film and it is funny , because the comedy is revolved around the fact that if you try to work together , things get done . These band of misfit students at Weinberg Military school have been placed in here because , as Sgt Liceman quotes " because you are outcasts , embarrassments to your families and communities , disgraces . " One of Ralph Macchio 's earlier performances before the Karate Kid and My Cousin Vinny , with appearances from Barbara Bach as well , this film appeals to teens and young adults . Great soundtrack keeps the film moving .  
  First-time director Tom Kiesche turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting , dark comedy . Shot on a shoestring budget , yet had the flavor of the early Coen brother 's film Blood Simple .. and throw in some Monty Python flavorings to boot ! Needs to seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next . Expect more good things to come from this writer-director-actor .  
  I saw Heartland when it was first released in 1980 and I have just seen it again . It improves with age . Heartland is not just for lovers of " indie " films . At a time when most American films are little more than cynical attempts to make money with CGI , pyrotechnics , and / or vulgarity , Heartland holds up as a slice of American history . It is also a reminder of how spoiled most of us modern , urbanized Americans are . Nothing in this film is overstated or stagey . No one declaims any Hollywood movie speeches . The actors really inhabit their roles . This really feels like a " small " film but really it is bigger than most multizillion-dollar Hollywood productions . The film is based on the lives of real people . In 1910 , Elinore Randall ( Conchata Ferrell , who has never done anything better than this ) , a widow with a 7-year-old daughter Jerrine ( Megan Folsom ) , is living in Denver but wants more opportunities . She advertises for a position as housekeeper . The ad is answered by Clyde Stewart ( Rip Torn , one of our most under-appreciated actors ) , a Scots-born rancher , himself a widower , with a homestead outside of Burnt Fork , Wyoming . Elinore accepts the position ( seven dollars a week ! ) and moves up to Wyoming with her daughter . She and her daughter move into Stewart 's tiny house on the property . It is rolling , treeless rangeland , a place of endless vistas where the silence is broken only by the sounds made by these people and their animals . It 's guaranteed to make a person feel small . The three characters go for long periods without seeing another human soul . What is worse , Stewart turns out to be taciturn to the point of being almost silent . " I can't talk to the man , " Elinore complains to Grandma Landauer . " You 'd better learn before winter , " replies Grandma . Grandma ( Lilia Skala ) is one of the only two other characters who are seen more than fleetingly . She came out to Wyoming from Germany with her husband many years before and runs her ranch alone now that she is also widowed . Grandma is their nearest neighbor ( and the local midwife ) and still she lives ten miles away ! The other supporting character is Jack the hired hand ( Barry Primus ) . Elinore 's routine ( and her employer 's ) is one of endless , backbreaking labor , where there are no modern conveniences and where everything must be made , fixed or done by hand . This is the real meat of the film : Watching the ordinary life of these ranchers as they struggle against nature to wrest a living from the land . But despite the constant toil and fatigue , Elinore is always looking for other opportunities . She learns that the tract adjacent to Stewart 's is unclaimed . Impulsively , she files a claim on the property ( twelve dollars , or almost two weeks ' pay ! ) , meaning that if she lives on it ( and she must actually live there ) and works it for ten years , she will get the deed to it . Naturally , Stewart learns what she has done . With merciless logic , he points out that with no money , no livestock , no credit , and no assets , she has no chance of succeeding . He then offers a solution : He proposes marriage . The stunned Elinore realizes that this is the only real alternative , and accepts . We think that Stewart 's proposal is purely Machiavellian-he wants the land and the free labor-but we see that , in fact , he is genuinely fond of Elinore , and they grow together as a couple . She becomes pregnant ; she goes into labor in the middle of a midwinter blizzard ; Clyde travels for hours on horseback through the storm the ten miles to Grandma 's and the ten miles back , only to announce that Grandma wasn't there . This is more like real life than is pleasant , folks . Elinore has the baby all by herself , with no help whatsoever . Their son is still an infant when he gets sick and dies . They lose half their livestock to the vicious winter . They struggle on . The last sequence in the film is supposed to be optimistic : The birth of a calf . Clyde calls Elinore urgently to help him deliver the calf . Instead of being head first , the calf is in a footling breech presentation . He and Elinore must physically pull the calf out of the birth canal . There is no CGI , animatronics , trickery , fakery or special effects : What you see is what happened , folks : A calf is born on a bed of straw in a wooden barn by lamplight . With that , the film does not so much end as simply stop , leaving the viewer unsatisfied , but after a while you appreciate the film as a whole , not just for its ending . This little gem rewards patience and thoughtfulness . It will be watchable long after most of the films of the last generation have long been forgotten .  
  Sergio Martino has impressed me recently with his Giallo classics ' The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh ' and the unforgettably titled , ' Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key ' - but even so , I wasn't expecting too much from this film . The Case of the Scorpion 's Tail doesn't get mentioned as much as the aforementioned titles when it comes to classic Giallo discussion - but I don't know why , because this is at least as good as those two ! Dario Argento may be the ' king ' of Giallo , but with the five films that he made - Sergio Martino surely isn't too far behind . In some ways , he even surpasses the master . All of Martino 's films were released prior to the jewel in Argento 's crown , the magnificent Profondo Rosso , so back in the early seventies - Martino was the king ! The plot here follows the idea of murder for profit , and follows the insurance payout of a wealthy man . His wife inherits $ 1 million , and it isn't long before there 's people out for her blood ! When she turns up dead shortly thereafter , an insurance investigator and a plucky , attractive young journalist follow up the case . The Case of the Scorpion 's Tail may not benefit from the beautiful Edwige Fenech , but it does have two of Martino 's collaborators on board . Most famous is George Hilton , who worked with Marino on The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh and All the Colors of the Dark , along with a number of other Giallos . Hilton has a great screen presence , and every time I see him in an Italian thriller ; it becomes obvious why he is repeatedly cast . The beautiful Anita Strindberg , who will be remembered from Your Vice is a Locked Room , stars alongside Hilton and excellently provides the classic Giallo female lead . Sergio Martino does a good job in the director 's chair once again , with several beautiful scenes - the best of which taking place in a room bathed with green lighting ! The score by Bruno Nicolai ( Wardh ) excellently sets the mood , but it is the script that , once again , is the driving force behind Martino 's success . Ernesto Gastaldi , the writer for Martino 's other four Giallo , has put together a script that is thrilling while staying away from the common Giallo pitfall of not making sense ; thus liberating this film from the rest of the illogical genre . The Case of the Scorpion 's Tail is a quality Giallo film , and yet another success for the great Sergio Martino . If you like Giallo , you 'll love this !  
  First saw this movie in about 1990 , and absolutely died laughing through it . It became a cult favorite with my circle of friends , and we 'd quote from it at the drop of a hat ( " I 'm going home in a bag ! " ) . Needless to say , the humor is still there , 15 years later . It 's become a tradition at Halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film ( good thing you can still buy it off Ebay ! ) I 've found that Halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheek .. and this movie provides it all - pathos , suspense , unrequited love , nobility and the list goes on . Royal Dano provides an amazing heartfelt performance as Old Man Wrenchmuller . I remember seeing him in " The 7 Faces of Dr . Lao " as a bad guy who met a bad end . Here , you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning . If you aren't careful , you 'll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie . The creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments , little subtle costume digs at other sci-fi movies , and even a scene ripped from the pages of Wile E . Coyote ! Don't spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie , people - this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking , and shouldn't be offensive to anyone ( well , maybe stupid people , but they won't know they 're being mocked .. ) . - Now if you 'll excuse me , I 'm gonna go get a ' Zag-nut ' bar .. - Ramsay " RC " Cowlishaw , karaoke DJ / entertainer  
  Bela Lugosi gets to play one of his rare good guy roles in a serial based upon the long running radio hit ( which was also the source of a feature film where Lugosi played the villain . ) Lugosi cuts a fine dashing figure and its sad that he didn't get more roles where he could be the guy in command in a good way . Here Chandu returns from the East in order to help the Princess Nadji who is being hunted by the leaders of the cult of Ubasti who need her to bring back from the dead the high priestess of their cult . This is a good looking globe trotting serial that is a great deal of fun . To be certain the pacing is a bit slack , more akin to one of Principals ( the producing studios ) features then a rip roaring adventure , but it 's still enjoyable . This plays better than the two feature films that were cut from it because it allows for things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or having a sense that " hey I missed something " . One of the trilogy of three good serials Lugosi made , the others being SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps  
  This movie is a riot . I cannot remember the last time I had such a great time at the movies . I 've seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny . But this one is wall to wall great lines . I think Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so hard and so much in . The movie was non-stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up . Other than that it 's a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations . I 'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the Zucker movies where you don't get all the jokes the first time around . You have to see it two or three times to get it all in . As far as the actual film goes , it could have used a better edit , it 's choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that . All the characters are great . It 's not like an Adam Sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke . I think I will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable . No victims in this movie . Also , thank God they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend . Catherine Keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film . You just wish that women like her really existed . She 's not a " 10 " like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts overdone overbite . If you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it . I assure you , the trailer does not do it justice . They do not give away all the good jokes . Just some of the mediocre ones . Oh and one more thing . I hope critics put this on their top ten list . Many of them complain that comedies don't get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don't put it on their list . This means you Ebert !  
  BEWARE SPOILERS . This movie was okay . Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best two in it . Okay , so the goofie foreign guy who ( SPOILER HERE ) trades with the biker for his clothes was funny . This guy 's boss was good , too . But the movie really belonged to Sarandon and Hawn . These two should have had a lot more time on screen together . They 're chemistry was great . The bathroom scene-WOW ! Romantic , sweet , yummy . Hawn is a goofy cocktail waitress who saves a foreign man and ends up at the whitehouse in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians . To talk about Sarandon would be to give a lot away . SPOILERS This is a rather untypical romantic / political comedy , and it satisfies both somewhat-the political side a whole lot more than the romantic . It touches on political issues , and just barely skims on romantic areas .  
  So many wonderful actresses in one film serve as a practical invitation to the local movie house so I duly responded . Here are some remarks .. Vanessa Redgrave is great even while lying in bed . She also looks very old and I don't think this is achieved with much make-up which is a good thing for the film but a sad thing for us cinema-goers . I think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years . Claire Danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth . Mamie Gummer 's resemblance to her mother Merly Streep both in terms of physical appearance and acting style is so striking that I lost my concentration to the film for a couple of minutes after her entrance . She is surprisingly good ; however such a resemblance has the danger of working against her favor . I agree with a previous comment : Natasha Richardson definitely had some plastic job done to her face . She certainly does not look like how I remember her from previous films ( " Nell " for example . ) Both she and Toni Collette sadly do not make much impression partly because they do not look convincing as sisters . Their interplay is weak . Toni Collette additionally is way too old for her character . Glenn Close and Meryl Streep had to have more screen time . Streep 's performance actually is little more than a cameo . Her scenes on the other hand have bigger emotional resonance than the rest of the film . Eileen Atkins provides some welcome dry wit , especially in her second role as an imaginary nighttime companion to Redgrave 's character . As for the men ; Hugh Dancy enlivenes the film considerably even though he gives a broader performance than needed . As a matter of fact as soon as he exits the story it starts to drag . It is also to his credit that he manages to create the exact necessary sense of boyish charm in the viewer . Patrick Wilson on the other hand is a complete void at the center of the film . He also has the misfortune that the script is insufficient in explaining why three people ( one of them a man ) are so much smitten by this man . The backstory to this should have been developed more . The cinematography is excellent as expected . However the main summer house set failed to convince me . It does not look natural on the top of that rocky hill , particularly with its grass patch in the front . A bit too cardboard like . Overall , the film is a classy production , but a seen it all before , cried at it all before feeling took over me during most of its duration and consequently it failed to make the kind of impact on me that I expected from a tearjerker . However , it still managed to make me thoughtful about the passing of time , about one 's expectations from life and the extent to which these are fulfilled or not . Worth trying at least on DVD if not at the movies ..  
  The first " side-story " in the universal century Gundam universe presents a refreshing new look at the war between earth and the space colonies . The focus is no longer on a small group of individuals who would go on to play pivotal roles in the conflict , but on the everyday civilian population and how the war is seen through their eyes . The story does contain some Gundam staples , its premise being the attempts by a ZEON squad to capture an experimental Gundam , but it the execution of the plot that made this show so interesting to watch . This series focuses on the experiences of a young boy named Alfred and the relationship between his neighbor , Christina Mckenzie who is secretly a Federation pilot and a newbie Zeon pilot named Bernie Wiseman . Alfred develops a sort of " brotherly love " for Bernie while our young Zeon pilot also falls for Christina . " War in the Pocket " proves that you do not need a sweeping epic tale about special individuals to make for a good war story . There are no uber ace pilots or large scale fleet battles to be seen here . This short 6 episode OVA focuses a lot more on character emotional drama over other themes like politics or philosophy and i love how realistically portrayed the characters are . Alfred is your typical everyday kid who plays violent computer games and thinks the armed forces is cool . He is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war . The unlikely friendship and bonding between Bernie and Christina , each not knowing the fact that they are soldiers on different sides of the war , is played very real without going overboard with the romance drama stuff . Same goes for the endearing relationship between Alfred and Bernie . That being said , i would not want to spoil much of the story here , but it makes it a whole lot more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that unfold as the show moves along all the way to its emotionally devastating twist ending . Despite its lack of action , this show never falls into the category of " boring " . The characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show . Not to worry as there are a number of mobile suit action scenes scattered here and there . Each are beautifully animated on a level that surpasses that of an OVA and are sure to satisfy the craving for some " mandatory " mobile suit battles in a Gundam series . Normally watching anime in Japanese or English , i would leave up to personal preference . But in this case , i strongly recommend the English voice track over the Japanese one . Not only do the characters , whom all except Alfred are caucasian , sound more believable in English but the performances of the English voice cast are on par and even surpass the Japanese one , instilling each character with such realistic emotions and intonations that they sound just the acting in some live action TV dramas . In short , this show does not try to impress the audience . What it does is conveys numerous heartwarming themes that hit closest to home especially the death of innocence on the battlefield and the horrors of war through the eyes of a child . A truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given .  
  The violent and rebel twenty-five years old sailor Antwone Fisher ( Derek Luke ) is sent to three sessions for evaluation with the navy psychiatrist Dr . Jerome Davenport ( Denzel Washington ) , after another outburst and aggression against a superior ranked navy man . Reluctant in the beginning of the treatment , he gets confidence in Dr . Davenport and discloses his childhood , revealing painful traumas generated in his foster house . Meanwhile , he meets Cheryl Smolley ( Joy Briant ) , and they fall in love for each other . Resolving his personal problems , Antwone becomes a new man . This true familial drama is a touching and positive story of a man who finds a friend and is sent back to a regular life . The direction of Denzel Washington is excellent , making sensitive , attractive and with good taste , a story about child abuse . In the hands of another director , it might be a very heavy story . My vote is eight . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Voltando a Viver ' ( ' Returning to Live ' )  
  Back in the day if Marion Davies had had her druthers and didn't just listen to William Randolph Hearst , she 'd have done more films like Show People and been a lot happier . In fact when you see her get her first big break in two reel comedy , she 'd have loved to have done that in her career instead of such epics like When Knighthood Was In Flower and Janice Meredith . What you 're seeing by all accounts in Show People is the real Davies , a gifted comedienne , a superb mimic and a generous good hearted person . She could really identify with the character of Peggy Pepper aka Patricia Prepoire , she put up with her share of pretense in her Hollywood stardom . If the plot of Show People was set in the legitimate stage you would call it a backstage story . I guess it being one of the first movies about the movies you could call it a behind the camera story . Marion is eager young hopeful who arrives in Hollywood like so many others , looking for that big break . She wants to drama , but her introduction to the movies is as the foil for the burlesque comics . She gets her share of pie and seltzer in the face , but learns her trade . And also wins the heart of young comic actor William Haines . She does get her first big break , but it doesn't come for Haines as well and Marion does get to do legitimate drama with actor Paul Ralli , playing Andre Telfair , a pretend no account Count of Avignon . Somebody here was taking a shot at actor Lou Tellegen , lover and husband of Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others and to hear tell of it , one of the most despised people in cinema . Show People was one of the first films to have the unbilled cameo appearances of stars as themselves . You will get to see folks like Charlie Chaplin , Douglas Fairbanks , William S . Hart , Mae Murray , John Gilbert , Eleanor Boardman etc . , just being themselves in and around the film colony . That in itself makes Show People a film worth saving . Show People also made good use of standard Tin Pan Alley songs like , Ain't We Got Fun , I 'm Sitting On Top Of The World , You 'd Be Surprised , California , Here I Come . As the film came out on the cusp of sound being introduced , a song called Crossroads was introduced in it . It 's not a bad number , but no credit is given to the boy and girl singing it in the soundtrack . I guess since they 're not seen , it was felt no billing was necessary . Still I 'd like to know and I 'm sure you would to if you are fortunate enough to see Show People . It 's easy to see why Marion Davies liked this film so much and considered it a personal favorite . She looks so at home in this film and her real life lack of pretense shines through in her performance which makes it a real treat for the audience .  
  Just the kind of movie I love . Some very good British actors as well as the one and only Sharon Stone . Catherine Tramell ( Stone ) masterfully manipulates a well educated group of people 's lives , playing on their frailties to collect experiences to write a murder mystery book . She plays the female psychopath quite well while using her ample sex appeal to convincingly portray what could be considered one of the ultimate Black Widows . Tramell is use to dark places within society and freely partakes in sadomasochistic flings in the ' never visit after dark ' side of town . From the beginning , there is nothing short of an R rating here from the dialog alone . Stone could also be described as a sort of female Hannibal Lecter , an emotionless femme fatal without the meal plan .  
  What a thrill ride ! Twisted and thought provoking . Once again , Sharon Stone pulls off her drop dead gorgeous , spellbinding character of author Catherine Tramell impeccably . The original Basic Instinct takes place in San Francisco . The sequel takes place in London , where Catherine has now relocated . Both bustling cities known for excitement , haute couture ~ and a perfect place for someone like Catherine Trammel to take residency . David Morrisey , ( " Derailed " ) , plays the smooth role of psychiatrist Dr . Michael Glass . The character David Thewlis plays as Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard , is a refreshing departure from his role as Lupin in the Harry Potter series . Flashy cars , designer clothes , sex , drama , humor , tension , - all of the " basic instincts . " Mind bending throughout . Great screenplay . From the climactic opening scene to the surprise ending , this film is anything but boring ! Everyone in the theater was glued to the screen .  
  I don't understand your objections to this movie . It is a taut , thrilling extension of the character created in " Basic Instinct " . The only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic , is the fact that Sharon Stone 's character is still alive and not in jail at this late date . SPOILER ALERT : As the movie progresses , we are presented with three theories of what is going on : 1 ) Sharon Stone 's character is killing all these people because she 's crazy ( Risk Addicted ) ; 2 ) David Thewlis ' crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame Sharon Stone 's character ; 3 ) David Morrissey 's analyst is killing these people for revenge . What upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the " real " story . ( Although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop ; the only killing that occurs on screen . ) I think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of " 2001 , A Space Odyssey . " WHO CARES what is real ? The blonde really is crazy , the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge . What 's important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story . Like real life , everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie . Get over it !  
  I 've seen hundreds of silent movies . Some will always be classics ( such as Nosferatu , Metropolis , The General and Wings ) but among them , my favorite is this film ( it may not be the best-but a favorite , yes ) . In fact , when I looked it up on IMDb , I noticed I immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so gosh-darn cute and well-made . Marion Davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not JUST William Randolph Hearst 's mistress . The story involves a hick from Georgia coming to Hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star ! Her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a must-see !  
  Almost too well done .. " John Carpenter 's Vampires " was entertaining , a solid piece of popcorn-entertainment with a budget small enough not to be overrun by special effects . And obviously aiming on the " From Dusk Till Dawn " - audience . " Vampires : Los Muertos " tries the same starting with a rock-star Jon Bon Jovi playing one of the main characters , but does that almost too well .. : I haven't seen Jon Bon Jovi in any other movie , so I am not able to compare his acting in " Vampires : Los Muertos " to his other roles , but I was really suprised of his good performance . After the movie started he convinced me not expecting him to grab any guitar and playing " It ' my life " or something , but kill vampires , showing no mercy and doing a job which has to be done . This means a lot , because a part of the audience ( also me ) was probably thinking : " .. just because he 's a rockstar .. " . Of course Bon Jovi is not James Woods but to be honest : It could have been much worse , and in my opinion Bon Jovi did a very good performance . The vampiress played by Arly Jover is not the leather dressed killer-machine of a vampire-leader we met in Part 1 ( or in similar way in " Ghosts of Mars " ) . Jover plays the vampire very seductive and very sexy , moving as lithe as a cat , attacking as fast as a snake and dressed in thin , light almost transparent very erotic cloth . And even the optical effects supporting her kind of movement are very well made . It really takes some beating . But the director is in some parts of the film only just avoiding turning the movie from an action-horrorfilm into a sensitive horrormovie like Murnau 's " Nosferatu " . You can almost see the director 's temptation to create a movie with a VERY personal note and different to the original . This is the real strength of the movie and at the same time its weakest point : The audience celebrating the fun-bloodbath of the first movie is probably expecting a pure fun-bloodbath for the second time and might be a little disappointed . Make no mistake : " Vampires : Los Muertos " IS a fun-bloodbath but it 's just not ALL THE TIME this kind of movie . Just think of the massacre in the bar compared to the scene in which the vampiress tries to seduce Zoey in the ruins : the bar-massacre is what you expect from american popcorn-entertainment , the seducing Zoey in the ruins scene is ALMOST european-like cinema ( the movie is eager to tell us more about the relationship between Zoey and the vampiress , but refuses answers at the same time . Because it would had slow down the action ? Showed the audience a vampiress with a human past , a now suffering creature and not only a beast which is just slaughtering anybody ) . And that 's the point to me which decides whether the movie is accepted by the audience of the original movie or not . And also : Is the " From Dusk Till Dawn " - audience really going to like this ? I 'm not sure about that . Nevertheless Tommy Lee Wallace did really a great job , " Vampires : Los Muertos " is surprisingly good . But I also think to direct a sequel of a popcorn movie Wallace is sometimes almost too creative , too expressive . Like he 's keeping himself from developing his talent in order to satisfy the expectations of audience . In my opinion , Wallace ' talent fills the movie with life and is maybe sometimes sucking it out at the same time . " Vampires : Los Muertos " is almost too well done . ( I give it 7 of 10 )  
  This film exceeded my expectations . I thought and have heard that it was going to be rubbish , so i wasn't expecting much . However , i was pleasantly surprised . At first i didn't take well to the lead girl and didn't really care if she lived or died . After a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character . It 's not just some slasher film where people die for no reason . There is a background story that only takes a few seconds of the film , but explains a lot . I would recommend this film to everyone . If you 're not sure just watch it anyway , it 's only an hour and a half of your life . You 're going to live for 80 years anyway .  
  First of all i 'd just like to say this movie rawked more than any of the recent crap that hollywood has cooked up out of its bowels . McBain is a true action film with more violence than most viewers can handle . It has all of the classic elements of a late 80 's / early 90 's action film .. the random gratuitous acts of violence ( ie . when Walken and crew go in to confront the drug dealers to get money they just show up and kill them rather than letting them live and just taking their money ) , the snapping of necks , the guys on fire , the guys that get blown off buildings , and of course the guys who are on fire that get blown off of buildings . Walken is at his finest in this picture delivering memorable lines such as , " let 's go sit .. out on the deck . " and others that make this film a top buy off of the clearence rack at the local video store . if you have a bloodlust for unnecessary random acts of violence rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst .  
  Whilst it is universally acknowledged that Fearful Symmetry was heavily influenced by the Kolchak episode They Have Been , They Are , They Will Be , whether this makes it a rip-off or a homage is an altogether more controversial point . As a huge fan of both series I subscribe to the latter belief , although the less charitable may not do . James Whitmore was brave to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode , invisible elephants and gorilla suits sounds like a recipe for disaster , but he pulls it off with style , the teaser being an absolute gem . Lance Guest does a great job of making a credible character out of Kyle Lang and Jack Rader seethes with menace as Ed Meecham . Forget Fearful Symmetry 's dubious originality and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X File .  
  In Budapest , Margaret Sullavan ( as Klara Novak ) gets a job as clerk in a gift shop ; there , she bickers with co-worker James Stewart ( as Alfred Kralik ) . The two don't get along on the job because each has fallen in love with a unseen pen pal . Watching Ernst Lubitsch direct these stars through the inevitable is predictably satisfying . Even better is a sub-plot involving shop owner Frank Morgan ( as Hugo Matuschek ) , who suspects his wife is having an affair . Hiring a private detective , Mr . Morgan confirms his wife of 22 years is having sex with one of his younger employees . Morgan , painfully realizing , " She just didn't want to grow old with me , " and the supporting characters are what keeps this film from getting old . * The Shop Around the Corner ( 1/12/40 ) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart , Margaret Sullavan , Frank Morgan , Joseph Schildkraut  
  Has there ever been a movie more charming than this ? One of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other 's lives . The center of it is the " romance " of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan , who work together and can't get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals . But there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies ( including " You 've Got Mail " , the recent update of " Shop " ) they 're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs . Everyone gets to be an intricate part of Ernst Lubitsch 's rich tapestry of charm . One of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near-tragic Frank Morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have Christmas dinner with . A must see ! * out of *  
  Shall We Dance is an excellent film because it shows how something , like dancing , can rejuvenate the life flow in the human spirit . Dance is seen as the expression of existence , and the birth of individuality . The is certainly the case with Aoki . At work he is a humble office denizen , but place him on the dance floor and all his bottled up intensity is released . Surprisingly , this release is frowned upon in Japan , due to the rigid culture of conformity . At the start of the film , all the characters are ashamed or frightened of their desire to dance . They will be scorned , or deemed perverted , for expressing their passion through dance . This film is well worth watching to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions . It will leave a smile on your face for days .  
  E ! TV is a great channel and Talk Soup is so funny , in a flash you can view the episodes change . We want more funny writings by the best writer ever Stan Evans .. The patron Saint of the mindless masses .. He is a truly talented , gifted writer , actor , comic , producer , director , and creative consultant . Anna Nicole loved him , but he was not a $ Billionaire so he left him for a Billionaire . Many super stars wanted to make films with the actor Stan Evans , who has a " Humphrey Bogart " { Clark Gable } acting style . He should make many more movies . Maybe with Stephen Spielberg , or perhaps many other talented producers . We wish him a moment of FAME with a great fortune to gain . Has he produced any mock-U-dramas ? or perhaps any docudrama ? A project about Bernie Madhoff would be a great TV movie written by STAN EVANS . How many screenplays has he written ? Is he under $ billion contract with Disney ? He should earn more than $ 50 Million .. He could also write a TV movie about the late KING OF POP .. Michael Jackson . We want to view a lot more of and by Stan Evans in the movies and on TV . Thank you so very much . Elvis has left the building !  
  I am surprised at IMDb 's low rating of this movie . With all due respect , its low rating is representative of the IQ level of those who rated it so poor . They would rather see a movie with cheap thrills , a bigger budget , and more gore . The first misconception by people is that this is a horror film . It is not , nor does the film mislead you into believing it is one . It is a psychological thriller . It is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie . Reel . com 's review is the perfect example of how I feel about this movie . All the other negative reviews doesn't make much sense . It 's almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change - very rare these days - is something bad and not worth it . I will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and didn't make sense . Martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil Nazi who would kill without warning . The evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing , we sympathize with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film 's direction and writing . I definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the 6 's range on originality alone . I recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the IQ scale - aka smart people - since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch Scream or Freddy 's Nightmare . Kudos to the acting as well . For such a low budget film , you are amazed that this movie didn't hit your local cinema with the great direction , writing , and acting . Please don't be fooled by the rating by IMDb . This movie is worth it . I actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice .  
  As this movie is completely in Swiss dialect , it 's probably hard for most German speakers to really follow this movie . I 'm not from Switzerland , but I worked there for some years , so I had the chance to understand this great spoof of the Lord of the Rings . I 've seen a lot of movies of this kind ( eg . Scary Movie , loads of Scifi spoofs etc . ) but this one is the best one of that kind , I 've seen so far . I give a 9 of 10 . The only reason I can't give a 10 is , because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the DVD , so there 's almost no chance for non-Swiss to understand .  
  Another comedy about a plucky little country struggling through the jungle of the modern ( for the forties ) global world with only native wit and pluck to guide them , this is a fine entry in the Ealing cannon . Terry-Thomas sparkles as usual in the lead , as a feckless ministry man led to the brink of disaster when a nation he is supposedly in charge of starts attracting the interest of the world , Ian Bannen makes a great romantic lead , Peter Sellers puts in one of his quieter performances as a corrupt politico and the uber-suave John Le Mesurier plays against type as a rugged revolutionary leader . Lots of fun is had by all , especially the viewer ; perhaps not in the very top echelon of Ealing classics , but pretty high up .  
  Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and going to see this I was expecting a huge disappointment . Instead I got a film that perfectly portrays the irony , humor , elequence , and above all else the crushing sadness of Vonnegut 's novel . This is certainly Nolte 's best preformance to date . He captures the defeat and selfloathing of Howard Cambell Jr . consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the held back tears behind his eyes . Alan Arkin is absolutly hilarious as George Kraft . Sherryl Lee is haunting in her detachment from reality as Cambell 's young lover . John Goodman is understated and more than effective as Cambell 's " Blue Fairy Godmother . " This Pinnocioesque story of Cambell trying to be his own ideal hero and unwittingly becoming his ideal tragic villian is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people . And aside from that , it is one of the most deeply romantic films I have ever come across . Cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love . And at the films sastifyingly painful conclusion , he finally learns what it means to be a real boy as his Blue Fairy Godmother grants him his wish . And he realizes that .. well , watch the movie and you 'll see . Mother Night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made . It is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep within our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author .  
  Before this , the flawed " Slaughterhouse Five " was the best . But this screen adaptation of " Mother Night " is very true to the book and keeps the comedy , mystery , and tragedy intent . Thankfully it wasn't Hollywood-ized or idiotized a la the movie of " Breakfast of Champions . " Another good thing about this movie is that you don't have to be familiar with the book to follow it ( as I think you do for Slaughterhouse Five ) . That 's probably true of Breakfast of Champions also but they did such a bad job of that you 're better off just reading the book and not seeing the movie ! Nick Nolte did an excellent job in this film .  
  This movie pleasantly surprised me . It has a touching , slightly off-center approach that never loses your attention . This is a movie I never heard about , but if you want a " sleeper " , this is it . Great writing , production , and acting . I highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful . Nick Nolte , Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are marvelous . Why wasn't more made of this movie ?  
  Really .. and incredible film that though isn't very popular .. extremely touching and almost life altering .. was for me at least . Definitely worth seeing and buying .. Added to my favorite movie list .. it 's number one now .. This is a very touching movie that all people should see .. The Man in the Moon .. we 'll it 's just incredible . It 's now my favorite movie and I only saw it today and I 'd recommend it to anyone above 15 as long as you 're somewhat mature .. If you don't really try to feel the characters emotions then you 'll never get the true meaning and value of this movie .. But it really is incredible .. just watch it because it 'll alter the way some people look at life .. worth seeing 5/5  
  When I first saw this film on cable , it instantly became one of my favorite movies . I 'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall . The movie paints an accurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes . Most of the attitudes came from Soll , an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor . Soll is what makes the move , his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way The South was back then . I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer 's Disease . None the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex . While he has racist views , he 's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black . The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson ( Mel Winkler ) and Ben ( James Earl Jones ) . The conversations between Ben and Soll are the best in the movie , they have real chemistry . James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both but in great performances as well as Hass . This movie should have gotten more notoriety . However it 's on DVD and worth the money . Rayvyn  
  I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with Reese Witherspoon 's portrayal of Dani Trant , a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana circa 1957 . She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister , Maureen ( a now rarely seen Emily Warfield ) , and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative Baptist upbringing . Then seventeen year old Court Foster ( Jason London ) , the son of her mother 's close friend ( Gail Strickland ) moves in next door , Dani experiences her first crush , while Court enjoys her company , and willful spirit . Dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him , but as soon as he sees Maureen , he falls head over heels for her , leaving Dani behind . The sisters ' close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts , which only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident . The girls then are made to realize how much they need each other . Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as the loving parents , trying to balance their daughters ' individuality , at the same time trying to keep the family together . The beautiful cinematography , and the wonderful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley , The Platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film 's atmosphere of a simpler time . A touching coming-of-age film with a timeless message .  
  That magical moment in life , that point between the beautiful innocence of childhood , and the confusing whirlwind that marks adulthood . . . this is what this movie is all about . Danni ( wonderfully played by Reese Witherspoon ) is right at that moment in life when the movie starts . She swoons over Elvis , playing his records and wishfully thinking about love . Maureen her sister will soon be off to college , has no trouble with attracting boys , is beautiful , and seems to have it all figured out although she doesn't . She dates a local loser whos father is also after her , and just wishes she could find a decent boy and be swept off her feet . Danni like most young teenagers wishes she could be anyone else but herself because most teenagers think that who they are just isn't good enough . She wants to be Maureen but doesn't see that she is beautiful herself . The moment adulthood begins to intrude itself upon her life is when she meets Court Foster for the first time . Court whos father has recently died has moved to their old farm to work it with his mother and two younger brothers . He has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun . On one particular hot day he goes to the pond and jumps in only to find Danni skinny dipping . They yell and argue and Danni leaves . But they see each other a day later when Courts mother is invited to Danni 's to visit old friends ( Danni 's Parents ) . Danni becomes attracted to Court , and Court to Danni . She is a tomboy and is spunky , has attitude and says whats on her mind . Court is 17 and Danni 14 and he knows it but they continue to grow closer with their days at the pond between Court working the farm . By the time Court kisses her one day , Danni is smitten . Danni 's father tells her to invite Court to the house and he does . but things are uncomfortable for Court on his " sort of date " . The silence though is broken by his meeting with Maureen who has yet to see Court . One look between the two and its all over . The looks of pain and defeat on Danni 's face are both beautiful in their trueness to life and painful at the same time . The rest of the movie I will not tell but the movie has more to it than a relationship between a boy and two sisters . The greatness of the movie is in its depiction of lifes moments both beautiful and painful and the relationship between two sisters whose love is tested by both a boy that they love , and the pain they must endure both together and individually . Danni eventually marks her entrance into the world when she sees that the world is unfair , painful , and maybe even a little less hopeful than when the movie started . Few movies can truly capture the wonder of childhood and the pain of adulthood so perfectly . This movie has since the first time I watched it stuck in my mind . Its in the my Top 100 movie list and deservedly so . I only wish more movies like this were made , because if so . . . my faith in Hollywood would be a lot better .  
  What a delightful movie . The characters were not only lively but alive , mirroring real every day life and strife within a family . Each character brought a unique personality to the story that the audience could easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of close friends . The story has a true-to-life flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama , the laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops . The script does a good job of capturing the common emotions , actions and reactions of the characters to conflict , opinion , and resolve . Not an epic , but it is a very nice movie to watch with loved ones . Plenty of knowing head nods and ' ahh ' moments to share and enjoy .  
  This movie ( with the alternate title " Martial Law 3 " for some reason ) introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time . And it was a great introduction . Although I had never heard of him before , he seemed to be an excellent fighter . The action scenes in this movie are GREAT ! There are lots of them too , by the way . The recruit fight at the Peacekeepers HQ is especially good . There 's just something about one single guy beating the crap out of a bunch of people that 's really fun . And for the rest of the cast : Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the villain . Roles like this fits her ( but others don't ) . Matthias Hues also did a good job , as always . He 's a great fighter and macho-like character , and was a good rival for Wincott in this movie .  
  I watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and I can say that I didn't have the best time mainly because I didn't know about Ned Kelly or his story . But since this is a biopic , it 's important to at least know what to expect from the character . I don't know if the manner the events are told are true , or if it everything is fictional . But the way Ned Kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true . I don't think he 's portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief , but that 's just my opinion . This is a solid Western-type movie for everybody 's tastes . Heath Ledger is great as always and the sexy Naomi Watts charms the screen . Give this movie a chance if it airs on cable . Otherwise , I don't think I could recommend it .  
  This a Casper the Friendly Ghost short from my childhood , and I re-watch it on YouTube ( Thank GOD ! for You Tube ) ; after that I love this short , and it is one of my favorite Casper shorts . I love how the short starts off spooky with Frank Gallop 's haunting narration ; until we get to see Casper sitting by his tombstone in the cemetery , reading . While every ghost rose from the graves to " boo " people , Casper decides to leave in search for a friend . But in trying to make a friend , anyone who sees Casper runs away . Poor Casper sat on a log and weep ; until a little fox cub comes up an nuzzles him . Casper and the little fox quickly bond and he quickly names the cub Ferdie and considers him to be his very best friend . Casper and Ferdie 's relationship is put in tremendous jeopardy however when Casper is not keeping a close eye on Ferdie while they are playing a game of Hide and Seek . While Ferdie is hiding a hunter and two of his hunting dogs come and try to kill little Ferdie and Ferdie is running as fast as possible until he is out of breath and starts panting . While the hunter is firing gunshots towards Ferdie Casper notices they are trying to kill him and flies in the hunter 's direction and pleads that the hunter leaves Ferdie alone . And the hunter and dogs are terrified of Casper . Casper yells to Ferdie that the hunter and the dogs are gone and that everything is fine . But Casper sees Ferdie 's body is not moving and asks if he is OK . When Casper sees Ferdie has died he starts mourning in pain because he lost " the only friend he ever had in his whole life . " Casper returns back to the cemetery where he has buried Ferdie and has made a gravestone for him next to Casper 's gravestone . Casper continues mourning in pain until he sees that Ferdie has resurrected as a ghost himself . Ferdie starts licking Casper on his cheek . Casper screams for joy because he has been reunited with Ferdie . Overall , it is a really good short ; though surprisingly disturbing , showing death in a family-oriented cartoon .  
  I never thought an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes ! When I first purchased Casper & Friends : Spooking About Africa , I so much wanted to see the very first Casper cartoon entitled The Friendly Ghost ( 1945 ) , But when I saw the next cartoon , There 's Good Boos To-Night ( 1948 ) , It made me break down ! I couldn't believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing Casper 's fox get killed ! I never saw anything like that in the other Casper cartoons ! This is the saddest one of all ! It was so depressing , I just couldn't watch it again . It 's just like seeing Lassie die at the end of a movie . I know it 's a classic , But it 's too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me ! If I wanted to watch something old and classic , I rather watch something happy and funny ! But when I think about this Casper cartoon , I think about my cats !  
  This movie is about a side of Ireland that Americans don't normally see , the narrow-minded religiously prejudiced side of the ' friendliest race in the world ' . The movie , by the admission of the inhabitants of Fethard who are old enough to remember the events , is fairly accurate ( though they insist that the film-makers invented some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the action ) . The movie was very unpopular in Ireland as it portrayed the Catholic church in a bad light , but the simple fact is that representatives of the Catholic church * did * organise vetoes of minorities ( before Protestants it was the Jews ) . The film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in Ireland  
  Cinematography-Compared to ' The Wrestler , ' a degree of verite and cinematic skill that disarms the viewer , and then hypnotizes as well . Acting-The dialogue is minimal , but the pauses and silence poignant . Story-The conflict in a ' balkanized ' Denmark is volatile , as we saw recently jihad murders in the Netherlands and riots in France . While I harbor no love for Islam , the departure from the West from Christian values holds no cause for celebration . The director of this film managed to mirror the two societies in a way that belabored neither , emphasizing the development of Aicha as an individual who became a champion , not so much in the ring , but to all those around her . Even her worst . . . I will stop here to avoid the spoiler .  
  When I went to watch this movie my expectations were really low , but I was pleasantly surprised . I thought I was going to watch a boring teen-flick , BUT in fact the plot is interesting and well executed , the acting was somewhat convincing - especially from Melville who really shows his talent in this movie , and the fight scenes were - for a low budget movie - very well done . I think this movie deserves a broader audience than it has received . It is a movie , which can be seen by the whole family - maybe not the smallest of kids , since it contains some rather rough scenes . A movie about love , and the problems that can occur , when you go against your family traditions . Yes , the movie is very much like " Bend it like Beckham " , but I actually think this movie pulls it off better .  
  This film was amazing . It had an original concept ( that of a vampire movie meets Yakuza mob film ) . It is a humorous and yet highly dramatic and tragic movie about friendship , love , immortality , death , and happiness , and comments subtelly on society . On the part of Gackt Camui , the role of Sho was excellently delivered , and HYDE was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured yet humorous vampire , Kei . I also laughed and cried at the happy-go-lucky character , Toshi , who grew up with Sho . I loved each and every second of this this film , especially moments such as the funny Cigarette scene , the fighting scenes , and most of all , the heartrenching ending .  
  This movie surprised me ! Not ever having heard of Hyde of Gackt I was not expecting much ! The reason I wanted to watch this movie was because somebody mentioned that the movie contained some serious action scenes in John Woo style ! Normally I am very careful when this is claimed ! There is only one John Woo and til this day there hasn't been one director that comes close to his brilliance when it comes to action ! The fact that " Moon Child " would feature a vampire convinced me even more ! How can you go wrong with gun blazing vampires ! Sounds promising and interesting ! The first thing I noticed about this movie that the pace was considerably slow ! It takes it 's time to set the mood ! This movie contains some nice Hong Kong style action scenes ! But " Moon Child " isn't an action movie ! It is a drama about friendship and loyalty ! The focus is on the characters and their relation to each other ! The pop singers Hyde and Gackt do a good job in acting and are very believable as friends ! The only problem I had was with the plot ! A couple of times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to skip ! Example : When one member of the gang dies ( very dramatic moment ) Alexander Wang sees Kei ( Hyde ) drinking blood of one of the attackers ! Without warning and explanation the movie skips 9 nine years and most of the friends aren't together anymore ! Also without a proper reason given Son ( Alexander Wang ) and Sho ( Gackt ) have to kill each other ! I know that this is done to add some serious drama ! Because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it does feel forced ! Apart from the flaws in plot this movie has an ambiance and slickness that makes it hard not to like this movie ! It is hard to explain why this movie is wonderful ! But it just is ! The overall experience you get is heartwarming and sincere !  
  Being a huge fan of the Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde , I was terribly excited when I found out that they had made a film together and made it my mission in life to see it . I was not disappointed . In fact , this film greatly exceeded my expectations . Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors , I was prepared for brave yet not really that fulfilling performances , but am delighted to say that both of them managed to keep me captivated and believing the story as it went on . Moon Child has just the right amount of humour , action , romance and serious , heart-wrenching moments . I can't say that I 've ever cried more at a film and these more tender moments are admirably acted by the pair , in my opinion , definitely proving their skills as actors . The fight scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to begin with , you are quick to get into the movie and begin to bond with the characters . I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone , especially those who are fans of Gackt and Hyde .  
  Prof . Janos Rukh ( Boris Karloff ) discovers Radium X-a powerful force to be used for atomic power . Unfortunately Rukh has been contaminated by the Radium and starts to glow in the dark-and his touch causes instant death . Dr . Felix Benet ( Bela Lugosi ) develops an antidote-but Rukh starts to go mad due to the Radium AND the antidote and sets out to kill all he believed wronged him . The plot is silly and the " effects " that make Karloff glow in the dark are laughable , but this is still a fun little chiller . It moves quickly , has some great atmosphere ( notice Rukh 's " house " and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night ) and Karloff and Lugosi ( as always ) give great performances . There is also good acting by Franic Drake ( as Rukh 's wife ) and Violet Kemble Cooper ( as his mother ) . So it 's OK but just a notch below all the other Karloff / Lugosi movies . The plot is just too far-fetched for me to swallow . Still I did like this . I give it a 7 .  
  There is no doubt that during the decade of the 30s , the names of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films . After being Universal 's " first monster " in the seminal classic , " Dracula " , Bela Lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent ( sadly , this last factor would also led him to be type-casted during the 40s ) . In the same way , Boris Karloff 's performance in James Whale 's " Frankenstein " transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster . Of course , it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen , and the movie that united them was 1934 's " The Black Cat " . This formula would be repeated in several films through the decade , and director Lambert Hillyer 's mix of horror and science fiction , " The Invisible Ray " , is another of those minor classics they did in those years . In " The Invisible Ray " , Dr . Janos Rukh ( Boris Karloff ) is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planet 's past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of Andromeda . While showing his invention to his colleagues , Dr . Felix Benet ( Bela Lugosi ) and Sir Francis Stevens ( Walter Kingsford ) , they discover that thousands of years ago , a meteor hit in what is now Nigeria . After this marvelous discovery , Dr . Rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to Africa , looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor . This expedition won't be any beneficial for Rukh , as during the expedition his wife Diane ( Frances Drake ) will fall in love with Ronald Drake ( Frank Lawton ) , an expert hunter brought by the Stevens to aid them in their expedition . However , Rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip , as he 'll be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor . Written by John Colton ( who previously did the script for " Werewolf of London " ) , " The Invisible Ray " had its roots on an original sci-fi story by Howard Higgin and Douglas Hodges . Given that this was a movie with Karloff and Lugosi , Colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story , playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up . One element that makes " The Invisible Ray " to stand out among other horror films of that era , is the way that Colton plays with morality through the story . That is , there aren't exactly heroes and villains in the classic style , but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices . In many ways , " The Invisible Ray " is a modern tragedy about obsessions , guilt and revenge . A seasoned director of low-budget B-movies , filmmaker Lambert Hillyer got the chance to make 3 films for Universal Pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles . Thanks to his experience working with limited resources , Hillyer 's films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains , and " The Invisible Ray " was not an exception . While nowhere near the stylish Gothic atmosphere of previous Universal horror films , Hillyer 's movie effectively captures the essence of Colton 's script , as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward sci-fi . Finally , a word must be said about Hillyer 's use of special effects : for an extremely low-budget film , they look a lot better than the ones in several A-movies of the era . As usual in a movie with Lugosi and Karloff , the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality . As the film 's protagonist , Boris Karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes . As his colleague , Dr . Benet , Bela Luogis is simply a joy to watch , stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was . As Rukh 's wife , Frances Drake is extremely effective , truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress . Still , two of the movie highlights are the performances of Kemble Cooper as Mother Rukh , and Beulah Bondi as Lady Arabella , as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time , making unforgettable their supporting roles . Frank Lawton is also good in his role , but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast . If one judges this movie under today 's standards , it 's very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience . However , that would be a mistake , as despite its low-budget , it is remarkably well done for its time . On the top of that , considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept , it 's ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are frighteningly accurate . One final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters , specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive Dr . Rukh and the cold Dr . Benet , as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actors . While nowhere near the Gothic expressionism of the " Frankenstein " movies , nor the elegant suspense of " The Black Cat " , Lambert Hillyer 's " The Invisible Ray " is definitely a minor classic amongst Universal Pictures ' catalog of horror films . With one of the most interesting screenplays of 30s horror , this mixture of suspense , horror and science fiction is one severely underrated gem that even now delivers a good dose of entertainment courtesy of two of the most amazing actors the horror genre ever had : Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi . 8/10  
  Offbeat and rather entertaining sleeper concerning two very different brothers who are both not only so-called " fire starters " ( think Stephen King 's snore-fest of a book with the same name ) , but also forever at odds with each other over a woman who has a rather nasty habit of being a pyromaniac ! Good special effects ( especially towards the end ) , quirky performances from a pretty talented trio of actors and topped by a really interesting and oddly appropriate soundtrack ultimately make " Wilder Napalm " a unique treat of a film to watch .. if you can find it that is ! On a personal note , I was fortunate enough to snatch it up ( so to speak ) from the two-dollar bin at my local video-rental store . ( * out of * )  
  As if the film were not of value in itself , this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it . In the summer of 1968 I saw the film in NYC ; that fall in graduate school , I read the book for the first time . Some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film . And for better or worse-and I 've now read and taught the novel for over three decades-Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom .  
  This is a film that was very well done . I had heard mixed reviews while it was in production and have been waiting for its release ! Cheers to the director and all the actors . The supporting cast gave Eva Mendez what she needed to take this to the top . As everyone else here states , the latter portion of the film is riveting . Katie Cassidy did an amazing job with her character , being she had not done a lot of work when this film was made . She has quite the career ahead of her . I was amazed at her performance . I completely enjoyed the film , questioned my values in life and priorities , and am a better person for it ! A great message lies within the film . Release it so all can enjoy !  
  Being a fan of the first Lion King , I was definitely looking forward to this movie , but I knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original . I know that many Disney fans are wary of the direct-to-video movies , as I have mixed feelings of them as well . While watching The Lion King 1½ , I tried to figure out what my own viewpoint was regarding this movie . Am I going to be so devout about The Lion King that I will nitpick at certain scenes , or am I just going to accept this movie as just another look at The Lion King story ? Most of the time , I found myself embracing the latter . The Lion King 1½ definitely has its cute and funny moments . Timon and Pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie that centered around them . People just love these characters ! My favorite parts of the movie include the montage of Timon & Pumbaa taking care of young Simba and the surprise ending featuring some great cameos . I could have done without many of the bathroom jokes though , like the real reason everyone bowed to baby Simba at the beginning of Lion King 1 . I guess those types of jokes are for the younger set ( which after all is the target audience . I don't think many kids are really concerned about Disney 's profit margin on direct-to-video movies . ) However , I will say that I was somewhat annoyed when they directly tied in scenes from the original movie to this movie . I 'm just too familiar with the original that those scenes just stuck out like sore thumbs to me . Something would be different with the music or the voices that it would just distract me . As for the music , it wasn't too bad , but don't expect any classics to come from this movie . At least LK2 had the nice ballad , " Love Will Find a Way . " As for the voicework , it was well done in this movie . Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella did a great job as always , and even new cast members , the classic comedic actor Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner ( best known as Marge Simpson ) , did a great job also . You can even enjoy these great voice talents even more by checking out the Virtual Safari on Disc 2 of the DVD . That feature is definitely a lot of fun ! So all in all , The Lion King 1½ isn't a perfect movie , but it 's cute and entertaining . I think many Lion King fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is - a fun , lighthearted look at the Lion King masterpiece from our funny friends ' perspectives . My IMDb Rating : 7/10 . My Yahoo ! Grade : B ( Good )  
  At times , this overtakes The Thing as my favourite horror film . While Carpenter 's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick , Kubrick 's is more artistic , more thought-provoking , and probably scarier . It 's one of the few films where I can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it . I try not to compare it to the book  which I 've only read once , a number of years ago , and which scared me to death  because the two don't have a lot in common , besides the story and characters obviously . It 's almost as if Kubrick was banking on people 's love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening . And it that way , it 's certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made , as well as one of the greatest horror films . What makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares , not the blood and gore , not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time . It 's the destruction of Jack Torrence . Some people have complained about the casting of Nicholson in this role , saying that it 's too obvious that he 's going to go crazy in the film , given his past roles and his appearance . I disagree . We know he 's going to go crazy  since most of us have read the book  and Jack 's appearance only furthers this notion . But it 's the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared . He 's calm , quiet , patient . He engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with his own family . And with a wife and son as irritating as his , it 's a small wonder that he manages to do so . But once he gets to the Overlook , he changes . He becomes irritable , angry , on edge . The scene that always shocks me is when Wendy interrupts him typing , and he utterly loses it , telling her to " leave him the f * alone " . This is the first f-bomb dropped in the film , and it 's a shock to the system . From then on , all bets are off . Another thing I love is the multiple interpretations present in the film . We 're never really sure if what we 're seeing is actually happening . Many critics have noted that whenever Jack talks to a ghost , there 's a mirror present , showing that he may as well be talking to himself . But what of the other characters ? Wendy never sees anything until the film 's climax , until she is given a tour of the hotel 's many ghostly inhabitants , but she is well aware that something is wrong , while Danny connects with the place almost immediately . His psychic powers are not in question  how else would Hallorann know to come to the hotel ?  but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness ? It 's easy to claim that Jack merely loses it , being trapped in a hotel with his family , and Wendy later does as well  seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that  but what of Danny ? It appears that his body is taken over by Tony , but how do we know for sure ? None of these characters are reliable witnesses . Hallorann probably would be , and he warns of the dangers in 237 , but he 's killed as soon as he arrives at the Overlook ( a scare Kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel ) . And that final shot . Has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema ? Has Jack really been there before ? Or was his body merely ' absorbed ' into the hotel ? When talking about the acting in this film , any discussion begins and ends with Jack Nicholson . Shelley Duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history  probably on purpose , to give Jack 's character more of a reason to snap  and Danny Lloyd is no better , but Jack is a powerhouse . Part method , part improvisation , he 's simultaneously terrifying and appealing . For better or for worse , he 's the character with whom we identify with , not the annoying kid or nagging wife . We all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season , be able to do whatever we want . Who cares if it 's haunted ? Of course , the technical aspects are terrific . Kubrick 's long takes , strange angles , and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror . The use of colour , mirrors , long hallways , and every other motif only heightens this . And don't even get me started on that score . I don't know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting , electronic tune . Its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel , the mood , and the entire film itself . I know King doesn't like this film , but King 's input on cinema is nothing to brag about . As great of a novel writer he may be , his screenplays are terrible , and his attempt at directing is better left unnoticed . This is not a very faithful book adaptation , but it doesn't need to be , and it really shouldn't . Part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doesn't have the book to fall back on ; there 's no reassuring source material . Kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more . If only for that , this is one of the most innovative films in any genre . And it 's got everything else on top of that .  
  Hey now , I can't claim to have seen all of the films of Jesse ( Jesus ) Franco , and there sure seem to be a lot of them , but this is one of the better ( and weirder ) of the lot that I have seen . I 'd say most likely he was in his prime back in the late sixties / early seventies and anything lately has been a bit TOO strange for me , and it takes a lot for me to declare that . Anyway , this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points . This woman is an actress or something , performs in some theater in Berlin where acts of " fake " torture are performed for an appreciative audience ( ? ! ) and she seems to have this problem with dreaming . The catch to what 's real and what 's not in this movie is apparently the real stuff is in sharp focus and the dream stuff isn't . She seems to exist in a state of deja vu . I won't say this makes a whole lot of sense but it is pretty wild and weird and entertaining . Shots of Berlin make it seem like a lonely and creepy place , so that adds to the atmosphere . The ending is extremely abrupt though , the film just ends and the tape went black , I guess no need to let you know it was over at that point . My copy was from the Anchor Bay Euro-Trash collection , and I say , give me more Euro-Trash , I can't get enough of that crap . But it 's GOOD crap .  
  This is actually one of my favorite films , I would recommend that EVERYONE watches it . There is some great acting in it and it shows that not all " good " films are American ..  
  I 'm a fan of TV movies in general and this was one of the good ones . The cast performances throughout were pretty solid and there were twists I didn't see coming before each commercial . To me it was kind of like Medium meets CSI . Did anyone else think that in certain lights , the daughter looked like a young Nicole Kidman ? Are they related in any way ? I 'd definitely watch it agin or rent it if it ever comes to video . Dedee was great . Haven't seen in her in a lot of things and she did her job very convincingly . If you 're into to TV mystery movies , check this one out if you have a chance .  
  I saw this in the theater during it 's initial release and it was disturbing then as I 'm sure it would still be . It was the first part of ' 68 and this was still making the rounds in towns across America and there had recently been a mass-murder in my hometown where I saw this where a man went on a shooting rampage . The freshness of that close-to-home event combined with this dramatized true story made for a very disturbing theatrical experience . It really brought to life the excellent acting of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson . I was familiar with the novel based on the true event by Truman Capote and the screenplay and direction by Richard Brooks wove the event and Truman 's interpretation into compelling gritty cinematic adaptation . Music from Quincy Jones effectively scores it 's story . I 've only seen this a couple times since . It was too real . Almost like being a witness to the crime itself and riding along with the killers . I would give this a 9.0 of a possible 10 . Society is so desensitized to violence and crime today that this probably seems slow and tame and could be viewed with less effect but to anyone over 50 this will be a hallmark into the examination of the criminal psyche .  
  This film is close to be my favorite piece of celluloid . There is really not much I 'd need or want to say here . Except maybe " See this film " and " Enjoy the excellent work by Daniel and Pascal " , who carries you through this neat , funny and heartbreaking story about ' spending your eighth day ' - your own day ! Seeing this film made me think seriously about how I spend my eighth day = my life ! It appears , that some of us are wasting precious time doing things we think we need to do . Either if it 's pleasing a career or just consuming TV-shows and ballgames . What we tend to miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person - make a difference . About taking room and time to be spontaneous and live - NOW ! ( on the eighth day ) .. At least that was what I got from ' The Eighth Day ' .  
  This is a so called ' feel-good ' movies , however it made me sad in a way . Why ? Because I had the talent , but my parents didn't let me study at the sports academy , as well the fact that at the age of 12 I decided to quit soccer . And soccer is the red line in this movie . Together with the struggle youngsters have with the expectations parents have . An English-Indian girl and her parents , with their traditions and strong family ties , and on the other hand the English family with a daugther who dresses like a boy , and plays soccer .. a combination which worries her mother ! This movie also lines out the lives of ordinary people , as well as the Indian community in England . It is about believe in your dreams , and live your one life ( where did we hear that before ) . Paraminder Nagra ( a beautiful women ! ) plays Yasminda , a girl who is not interested in boys , new clothes , make-up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff . In contradiction with her sister Pinky , complete the opposite of Yasminda . A real must it is , to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of their parents , and finds her luck eventually . With great music from Blondie , Curtis Mayfield , Texas , Melanie C , as well as Indian hit songs . Pleasant to watch , but if you , as myself , ever played soccer , and never made it to the top , then this movie will make you melachonic .  
  This movie explores the difficulties that strain hopes , dreams , love and friendship , and incorporates humour beautifully . Along with a stunning cast and brilliant filming , the sound track enhances and amplifies the atmosphere and mood of this work of art . All actors and actresses give an extremely good performance , surpassing expectation in every way . Parminder Nagra is brought on to the big screen for the first time in this film , and she is exceptional , capturing the vividness and vitality that this movie is all about . Keira Knightly also works well with her co-stars , and this is her best work so far . All in all , this is brilliant film , and one that everyone should make the effort to see at least once .  
  Without a doubt , Private Lessons II is the greatest movie I have ever seen . A Japanese import ( poorly ) translated into English , its a joy to watch . Not much of it makes sense , but that doesn't matter . It 's the greatest comedy around without ever being intentionally funny . The film is rare and unavailable on video , but I have caught it a couple of time late , late at night on pay cable . My taped copy has been watched dozens and dozens of times as I slowly , person-by-person , introduce this film gem to the world . Joanna Pacula plays the tutor / lover to Ken , our hero . ( She apparently was just working for her check . ) Ken is played by Goro Inagaki , of the Japanese pop band SMAP , who gives it his all and has great hair through out the movie . Stacy Edwards , of " In the Company of Men " fame , shows up in the movie too and is probably happy that she found other film work afterwards . It takes at least three viewings to sorta figure out what the plot is . On repeating viewing you can enjoy elements like the abnormal amount of vases Ken has in his house ( at least 50 ) or that Ken is wearing a shirt with embroidered husks of corn in the movie 's finale . The movie is predictable , but highly quotable . My friends and I reenact entire scenes . Yes , it sounds like we 're lame losers and we are .. but we 're lame losers who have seen " Private Lessons II . " Be one of ten people in the world who have seen this movie . You 'll thank me for it .  
  The extraordinary Rosemary Forsyth is the main reason to see this flick . Why she never became a bigger store may never be known . But she is exceptional and steals every scene she 's in . Garson Kanin directed this piece of fluff and the cast is first rate , with Robert Drivas and Brenda Vaccaro especially memorable . A " 9 " out of " 10 . "  
  Recap : Zandalee is a young woman that feels more and more trapped in her marriage with Thierry . Thierry himself is struggling with the death of his father the previous year and has lost his way . He has submerged himself in work , laid of his writing , and Zandalee desperately misses the attraction between them . Into this enters Johnny , and old friend of Thierry 's who once were artists in exile together . But Johnny has kept on painting , and just have a day job for the rent . He takes the day as it comes and leaves tomorrow to its destiny . There is an instant raw attraction between Zandalee and Johnny , and they enter into an affair . But Zandalee struggles with her lust to be desired and her conscience and love for her husband . But none of them , not Zandalee , not Johnny and not Thierry can stop the relationships between them to spin totally out of control . Comments : It is set as a thriller . But maybe more a thriller of heart than a normal thriller where it 's about life and death , and threat of violence . Not that a thriller of heart can't take on fatal proportions , but the threat comes from a different angle . And it is not really until the second half in Zandalee until the thriller emerges , and even though the foundation for it is laid in the first half , I can't really describe the genre as a thriller then . Much more of a romantic drama than anything else , but with the underlying currents of other genres . The developing thriller is there , but it also has more than a little tint of a sensual erotic kind . Because that is what it is all about , what drives the characters and therefore the entire story . Desire . The need to have , and the need to be . In my opinion it is quite good , definitely a lot better than its current ( 4.1 ) rating anyway . It takes its time but it grows a good feeling of suspense , and it handles the erotic part very well , with taste . It is always an integral part of the story , needed to be there to give the story it 's needed weight , and I never felt it was an excuse to show a naked breast or anything like that . But unfortunately the climax of the story comes well before the end , and the end itself feels kind of flat , even if in its own way kind of dramatic . The cast is impressive , spearheaded by known actors like Nicholas Cage and Judge Reinhold . But the show is almost completely stolen by Erika Anderson . Beautiful and very adept at acting out the sometimes subtle feelings of desire , she excels were both Cage and Reinhold sometimes goes a bot overboard and become a little rough . Her career afterward is too thin for the talent she shows in Zandalee , I can only hope it is because of her own choices . Also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give some extra edge to the movie , it is Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano . When you 're in the right mood this is a very good movie , it could have used another end to get the credit it really deserves . 7/10  
  Japanese indie film with humor and philosophy where the three main characters run literally almost through the entire film , chasing each other due to strange circumstances and comical coincidence . As they are running , we see what is going on in their minds and how they got where they are at the moment . The act of running is a metaphor for these down-on-their luck people 's lives . In some way , what they 're really chasing for is not what they were originally chasing , but for meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams . Running makes them all feel truly alive . The big life-altering running adventure comes to an end when they accidentally get in the middle of something big , violent , and so absurd that it 's funny in a clever way . One of my favorite films of all time by genius director Sabu .  
  And here 's yet another piece of evidence to claim that we should all worship the Italian giallo and acknowledge it to be the absolute most unique sub genre in horror . Emilio Miraglia 's " The Red Queen Kills Seven Times " is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting , stylish production values , enchanting music , great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences . It 's a fabulous giallo ( released in the golden year 1972 ) that belongs in the top-five of every fan of Italian cinema . The storyline doesn't just introduce your average black-gloved & sexually frustrated killer , but blends good old-fashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth of the murderous " Red Queen " . At young age , their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings Kitty and Evelyn about an uncanny lady who , once every 100 years on April 6th , kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim . Fourteen years later , Kitty has become the successful choreographer of a prominent modeling agency ( even sharing her bed with the general manager ) when suddenly the killing spree begins . Sister Evelyn would be the obvious culprit , but she moved to the States recently .. Or has she ? Complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown at you every couple of minutes and the Red Queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallo-history . Her face can never be seen , but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim . She 's not exactly gentle either , as her victims are barbarically stabbed with a dagger , dragged behind cars and even impaled on fences ! That latter one is truly one of the greatest ( = most gruesome ) acts of violence I 've ever seen ! What more could you possibly request ? Some classy and tasteful nudity , perhaps ? The gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered , among them Barbara Bouchet and a young Sybil Danning . Emilio Miraglia isn't the most famous giallo-director , as he only made this one and the equally recommended " The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave " , but his influence and importance should NOT be forgotten .  
  Of all the movies I have seen , and that 's most of them , this is by far the best one made that is primarily about the U.S. Naval Airships ( Blimps ) during the WW-II era . Yes there are other good LTA related movies , but most use special effects more than any real-time shots . This Man 's Navy has considerably more real-time footage of blimps etc . True , lots of corny dialog but that 's what makes more interesting Hollywood movies , even today . P.S. I spent 10 years ( out of 20 ) and have over 5,000 hours in Navy Airships of all types , from 1949 through 1959 . Proud member of the Naval Airship Association etc . [ ATC ( LA / AC ) USN Retired ]  
  Since the day I saw this film when it came out in 1981 , it has been one of my top 3 favorites . The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below , and I 'm just thrilled that it 's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06 - the film 's 25th anniversary . The last credit in this film explains its appeal - " Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed . " A charming and witty romantic comedy , it is a love story written to New Yorkers ( Peter Bogdanovich is a native ) who can identify every location ( West 12th Street , the Ansonia , the old FAO Schwartz , the Plaza , the Roxy , Chez Brigitte , and City Limits which was a country & western club ) . One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well off-screen as they do on , and this intimacy is clearly communicated . I laughed , I cried , it was better than CATS . Not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten , it was also Audrey Hepburn 's last feature appearance ( she had a cameo subsequent to this film ) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen . Buy it , make a big tub of popcorn , and curl up with someone you love .  
  This movie displays the kind of ensemble work one wishes for in every film . Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland ( who play husband and wife ) are positive chilling , discussing the " family business " as if it were a grocery store or a dry cleaners . Macy , Campbell , Ullman , and Ritter are also terrific . They play off each other like members of a top-notch theatrical troupe , who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support the others unselfishly . And finally , there 's Sammy ( David Dorfman ) . What an amazing performance from a child .. and what an uncanny resemblance he has to Ullman , whose son he plays ! We 're treated to a unique story in " Panic , " and that 's a rarity in these days of tired formulaic crap . The dialogue is sharp and smart , and this relatively short film nevertheless has the power to elicit a full range of emotions from the viewer . There are places to laugh , to be shocked , to be horrified , to be saddened , to be aroused , to be angry , and to love . It 's not a movie that leaves you jumping for joy , but when it 's over you 're more than satisfied knowing you 've spent the last ninety minutes experiencing a darn good piece of work . More of us would go to theatres if we were treated to quality fare like this . When are the powers that be in Hollywood going to wake up ? It 's a real shame when something this good fails to get exposure beyond festivals and households fortunate enough to have cable .  
  " They All Laughed " is one of those little movies I am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary . It is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past , but seems more contemporary . Even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesn't date it too much . Bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet , that reality never brings it crashing down to earth . But , that said , this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going , and " TAL " is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale . It is a movie that wouldn't linger so long in the memory if it weren't for the little moments provided by the excellent cast : Colleen Camp 's simultaneously shouting orders at John Ritter and her dog ; Blaine Novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat ; and especially the moment Dorothy Stratten falls for John Ritter and says , " How .. weird . " It 's such a piece of fluff one doesn't want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it , but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on one 's face .  
  Here Italy ( I write from Venice ) . Why cancelated ? The ABC should have given it a chance to build an audience . The cast ( w / Hope Davis , Campbell Scott , Erika Christensen , Zoe Saldana , Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan ) is one of the best I 've seen in recent . We need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless drones . I hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up .

  This is one of those films that explore the culture clash of Eastern born people in Westernized cultures . Loving on Tokyo Time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences . Ken , rock n'roll fanatic , marries Kyoto , a Japanese girl , so that she can stay in the United States when her visa expires . The marriage is only expected to be temporary , that is , until Kyoto gains legal status again . But , Ken , who seems to be lost in every relationship , takes a liking to Kyoto and tries very hard to make things work out . This , despite his friend 's urging that dumping Kyoto and getting rid of all commitments to girls is bad for rock n ' roll except to inspire some song writing about broken hearts and all of that . But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese upbringing , and doesn't expect to be married to Ken all that long . Not only that , she is homesick and wants to return to Japan . It 's sad in that this is finally someone Ken thinks he can love and be with and all that , except the one time he thinks he 's found someone to feel that way about , the girl isn't expecting to stay that long . It 's not that she doesn't like Ken , it 's just that she 's used to a whole ' nother way of life . She says , " I can't tell him the way I feel in English , and Ken can't tell me the way he feels in Japanese . " It 's a rather sad love story with a killer 80s techno-nintendo soundtrack . I picked up Loving on Tokyo Time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80s films , Tokyo Pop . And , for those of you who enjoyed Loving on Tokyo Time , check out Tokyo Pop ( a New York singer goes to Japan and joins a Japanese American cover band ) , except it 's a movie with a happy ending .  
  I was having just about the worst day of my life . Then I stumbled on this cute film , watched it , and now I 'm ready to go out & kiss a streetlamp . I have to admit , I only watched it for 2 reasons : VERA-ELLEN 'S LEGS . But it 's really so much more . The plot is actually quite clever and creatively woven . It 's almost like a Shakespearean comedy with all of its delightful misunderstandings . And of course there 's also .. VERA-ELLEN 'S LEGS . The only unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version I purchased ( the " 100 Family Classics " collection by Mill Creek Entertainment ) doesn't have the best video quality , and I 've heard the same about the Alpha release . The brightness and contrast are a bit too high , so a lot of the scenes seem bleached out especially when Vera is dancing in a white dress . But I suppose you can fiddle with the controls of your TV set to compensate . I can only imagine how it looked on the big screen back in ' 51 . The stage sets , costumes & colours are otherwise dazzling & delightfully creepy-sort of in a " Cabinet of Dr . Caligari " vein . As far as the romance goes , this is just perfect . Not sappy , not contrived , not melodramatic . Just 100 % ahh . Too bad , you poor schmucks , your miserable lives will never be as charming as this . Har har har . Wait , what am I laughing at ? My life sucks just as bad as yours . Oh hell . Time to watch this movie again .  
  Wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the spectator question : what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary .  
  When I rented this movie to watch it , I knew that it was not going to be a mindbender movie . Instead I thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating . And you know what it worked . Kurt Russel did what I though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was . I recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film .  
  " Jag är nyfiken  Yellow " is a lot of fun . Like at least one other reviewer , I was , on numerous occasions , laughing out loud . Yellow is energetic , playful , self-aware , explorative . Don't expect Bergman here . This movie is about a youth in the early - to mid-60s in Sweden and about the issues , read * contradictions * , that the nation and the world were facing . At times Yellow appears to be an earnest social-political documentary , with Lena , the main character , and others interviewing both common people and politicians ( e . g . Olaf Palme at home ) . At other times , Yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary . All the while , Yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring Lena 's life - her home life , her loves , her political views , her view of herself . She is a complete person  complex , flawed , contradictory , happy , sad , curious . And placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director , Sjöman , and his crew documenting themselves documenting Lena . It is this that , for me , really gives Yellow wings . Not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways , reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice , but their presence is itself another layer of the film ; they are filming themselves filming themselves . I am reminded of a Bjork music video with this same quality  a music video about the making of a music video , ad infinitum , with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish . I think Sjöman may have had something similar in mind . While " Jag är nyfiken  Yellow " may not be everyone 's cup of tea , it is certainly intelligent , witty , refreshing , ebullient , and authentic .  
  The ultimate homage to a great film actress . The film is a masterpiece of poetry on the screen . Like great poetry it is timeless . Direction , cast , screenplay , music , lyrics , in fact all the norms for movie-making are perfectly chosen to suit the message of the film . The Muslim society in India has never been presented with such respect , nobility and reality . The script is memorable in the hands of Meena , Ashok , Raaj Kumar , Nadira etc to name a few . Personally i was most impressed by the regal looking Kamal Kapoor . The master movie maker Kamal Amrohi 's lasting legacy to the sub-continent . A very beautiful film on a controversial theme that makes humanity look up and face the reality of the outcasts in the world . ' In ka naam ? Pakeeza ! haan Pakeza ' . Such acting is unheard of in this age of sex , dance and pornography .  
  Without question , this film has to be one of the greatest .. in cinematic history . I have it watched too many times to remember , and each time it is like I am seeing the film for the first time . Where does one begin ? Meena Kumari 's central performance is undoubtedly one of the finest of her career , followed closely by Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam and Phool aur Pathar . Each movement and nuance of her performance , makes any other Bollywood heroine pale into significance . Her masterly interpretation of Kathak coupled with her grace , tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of Urdhu , is like nothing ever seen on the bollywood screen . Pakeezah is perhaps the most stylised interpretation of the human condition ; the photography , sumptuous cinematography and mise en scene , are so charged with symbolism and meaning , that the viewer is left breathless . Naushads music , is unsurpassed , his knowledge of the music of the courtesan gharanas is incredible , and the way in which he punctuates the narrative with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is indeed remarkable . My only advice to anyone who seriously enjoys the spectacle of total cinema , should watch this epic mediation on life and art .  
  I have to admit that I went into Fever Pitch with low expectations . It 's no huge revelation for me to say that Jimmy Fallon 's last movie ( Taxi ) was Catwomanly bad , and the trailers for Fever Pitch were all right but didn't mesmerize me . I was already preparing some cheesy baseball puns for my review .. " I like Jimmy Fallon , but Taxi was strike one in his movie career . Well , now we 've got stee-riike twoo ! One more strike , and it 's back to SNL ! " or " Buy yourself some peanuts and cracker jacks , but don't buy tickets to Fever Pitch . You 'll walk out of the theater and never go back ! " Then the movie had to go and be way more entertaining than I was expecting . But hey , I couldn't let my puns go to waste , right ? Another reason I thought I wouldn't care for the movie is that I hate the Boston Red Sox . My whole family hates ' em . The mere mention of Pedro Martinez ' name sends me running to the bathroom . Oh man , hold on .. .. All right , I 'm back . Anyway , my mom , who is a St . Louis Cardinals fan , still believes the World Series was rigged last year . She refuses to believe the Sox won it legitimately . But I 'm man enough to admit that Fever Pitch caused me to sympathize , albeit only slightly , with the plight of Red Sox fans . Anybody who has a passion for sports will be able to relate to this movie on some level . Unless you have a favorite sports team you can't fully understand the extreme highs and lows that a fan such as Fallon 's Ben can go through . There 's nothing quite so fresh as the smell of a new season and nothing quite so smooth as a clean slate . Well , figuratively speaking . It 's the joy of being a sports fan . " Wait ' til next year , " becomes your mantra , your motto , your prayer - and Fever Pitch effectively captures that essence . I love the fact that the movie takes a fictional story and throws it against the real-life backdrop of the Red Sox ' improbable World Series run last year . I don't love it so much that I want to marry it , but you know what I mean . I expected this to be handled in a fairly cheesy manner , and while some of the humor is a little silly , it 's actually pretty realistic . You see , Ben 's uncle took him to his first Red Sox game when he was 7 years old , and when he died he left Ben his two season tickets . Ben hasn't missed a game in 23 years . At the beginning of each season he has a draft day where he and his friends get together to figure out who gets to go to which games with him . He makes everybody dance for the Yankees games and whenever somebody complains he threatens them with tickets for the games with the Royals ( sorry Mr . Shade ) and the Devil Rays . It 's a very good scene , and it works so well because I actually know of people who do the " ticket draft day . " I also must admit that I can relate to when Ben goes to dinner with Lindsey and her parents . The Red Sox are playing a road game , but instead of watching it live on TV Ben decides to tape it . One of the most dangerous things in life is taping a game and then being in public and trying to avoid hearing the result . Been there . It 's a very tense and scary situation . Weell , Ben enters the danger zone when a guy shows up at the restaurant and mentions watching the game . Ben immediately covers his ears and starts shrieking like a banshee so as not to hear the outcome . Lindsey is embarrassed , and her parents don't know what to think . Yeah , sports fans can be weird , I don't deny it . But it 's real . Now if you 're expecting the crude , edgy stuff that the Farrelly brothers are known for then you could be disappointed . They do have their moments though , like when Ben says he likes how Lindsey sometimes talks out of the side of her mouth " like an adorable stroke victim , " but overall this is definitely a softer , more romantic side that the bros are putting on display . That 's not to say that the movie ever gets way too sappy . Thankfully , when the sap starts to ooze a bit , the Farrellys know when to pull away . A romantic moment with Lindsey jumping on the field and running over to Ben to declare her undying love for him turns into Ben sincerely replying , " You 've gotta tell me about the outfield . Is it spongy ? " Jimmy Fallon proves that with the right material he can handle himself well on the big screen , and Drew Barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy charm . Fever Pitch is just good , solid entertainment that takes a somewhat fresh look at the romantic comedy genre . It 's a movie that guys and gals can both relate to . Particularly the guys who practice sports fanaticism at some point during the year and the ladies who must deal with ' em . Now if the Red Sox fans could please shut up about the " Curse of the Bambino " I would appreciate it . My Memphis Tigers have NEVER won the NCAA basketball championship , so I officially declare my plight greater than yours . THE GIST Fans of Jimmy Fallon , Drew Barrymore , romantic comedy , the Red Sox , baseball , or sports fanaticism in general should consider giving Fever Pitch a look . I wouldn't go out of my way to rush and see it at the first available time , but it 'll make a great matinée . Rating : 3.25 ( out of 5 )  
  I went to see Fever Pitch with my Mom , and I can say that we both loved it . It wasn't the typical romantic comedy where someone is pining for the other , and blah blah blah .. You weren't waiting for the climatic first kiss or for them to finally get together . It was more real , because you saw them through the relationship , rather than the whole movie be about them getting together . People could actually relate to the film , because it didn't seem like extraordinary circumstances , or impossible situations . It was really funny , and I think it was Jimmy Fallon 's best performance . All in all .. I would definitely recommend it !  
  A May day 1938 when happen a huge rally celebrating Hitler 's visit to Rome serves as the backdrop for a love story between Antoniette ( Sophia Loren ) married to fascist ( John Vernon ) and Gabriel ( Marcello Mastroianni ) . She 's a boring housewife with several sons and he 's a unhappy , solitary homosexual fired from radio and pursued by the fascists . She 's left alone in her home when her spouse must to attend the historical celebration . Then both develop a very enjoyable relationship in spite of their differences . The film is set on the historic meeting Fuher Hitler and Duce Mussolini along with others authorities as Count Ciano and King Victor Manuel II , describing the events by a radio-voice in off which sometimes is irritating . It 's a romantic drama carried out with sense and sensibility . An unrelentingly passionate romance between two conflicting characters . Magnificent performances from two pros make a splendid movie well worth seeing . Of course Ruggero Macarri and Ettore Scola 's sensible screenplay results in ever interesting , elaborate and sentimental . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Pascualino De Santis . Emotive musical score by Armando Trovajoly with sensitive leitmotif . The film won deservedly Golden Globes 1978 to best Foreign Film . Director Scola 's imagination stretches to light up the limited scenarios where are developing the drama . Usually his films take place on a few stages and are semi-theatrical . For example : ¨Le Bal¨ ( 1982 ) uses a French dance-hall to illustrate the changes in society 2 ) ¨Nuit of Varennes ( 1983 ) a stagecoach is the scenario where meet an unlikely group as Thomas Paine , Luis XVI and Marie Antoinette who fled from revolutionary Paris 3 ) ¨The family¨ ( 1987 ) all take place in the family 's grand old Roman flat ; and of course 4 ) ¨Una Giornata Particulare¨ or ¨A special day¨ where Loren and Mastroianni strikes up a marvelous relationship into their respective apartments and at the flat roof .  
  Despite what the title may imply , " Pigs Is Pigs " does not star Porky Pig . Rather , it features a young swine with an appetite more insatiable than John Belushi 's character in " Animal House " . His mother repeatedly scolds him , but it does no good . So much so that he goes to another house where a deranged scientist force-feeds him more than any mere mortal can handle ( but there 's a surprise at the end ) . I would mostly say that this cartoon seemed like a place holder in between the really great cartoons ( Daffy Duck debuted three months after this came out ) . But make no mistake about it , they do some neat things here . The whole force-feeding sequence looks more relevant today , given the obesity epidemic overtaking our country . Anyway , not the greatest cartoon , but worth seeing .  
  Soylent Green IS .. a really good movie , actually . I never would 've thought it . I don't really like Heston in his sci-fi efforts . He 's one of those actors who , like Superman , manages to come across all sneery and invincible most of the time . I prefer more vulnerable heroes . And indeed , he sneers his way through much of Soylent Green , too , but as he 's supposed to be playing an overconfident bully I don't really mind . I can understand why some people would turn their noses up at this movie . Soylent Green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals ( what do you know - it looks just like 1973 ) , and it 's lacking in action . But I admired the film 's vision of a complex , corrupt , and highly stratified society , and I was so pleased to see that Edward G . Robinson had such a moving , funny final role . Nice little character moments - like when he shares some precious food with Heston - really make the movie . The message of Soylent Green is pretty relevant these days , when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to . Funny , isn't it , to see Heston in a prototype Michael Moore movie ..  
  I saw Soylent Green back in 1973 when it was first released and maybe another eight times over the years on T.V. or video . It was always one of my favorite sci-fi and / or Charlton Heston films . Recently , the Egyptian theater in L.A. had a twelve film Charlton Heston retrospective . I flew in from out of state to see six of the films over a two day period . Soylent Green looked great on the large Egyptian screen with a perfect new print . From its opening montage to the going home scene to the great ending the film was fantastic . Charlton Heston as a cop who lives in a dog eat dog world with few natural resources left and no understanding as to how the world used to be and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great . Their chemistry together is wonderful . The film also looks so much better in a great 35mm print . Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen , and the cinematoraphy , writing , music used , and everything about it works . The film is also very powerful in its bleak and very possible view of the future . Just think how the world population grew , the rain forest that disappeared , resources used up , green house effect getting worse since 1973 . I just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years . Its reputation should be better . Speaking of reputations , often people speak as if Charlton Heston is not a great actor . Seeing him in El-Cid , Soylent Green , The Warlord , The Omega Man , Will Penny , and Major Dundee back to back I am convinced he is one of our best actors . Of course he made about a dozen other great films and for those that care you know what they are .  
  I give this movie an A + for the sheer camp of it ! As Dietrich 's daughter Maria Riva wrote in the book on her mother , " If one sees The Garden of Allah in the context of high camp , it can be very amusing . " And how ! I laughed with delight at the overwrought score and the astoundingly , ridiculously , fantastically melodramatic dialogue . Viewers who 've read the accounts of Boyer 's toupee ( it kept coming unstuck in the heat ) will snicker every time it makes an appearance . Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines - instead they gaze dreamily off into the distance , presumably so their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantageous light ( if you 're starring in a turkey might as well look good ! ) . Dietrich 's costumes are out of this world . As Riva notes in her book , Dietrich managed to steal Paramount 's Travis Banton and have him design some of the most divine gowns , such as the chiffon beige dress & cape . I heartily agree with the other reviewers who rave about the Technicolor . It really is hard to believe the film was done in 1936 - the color is fantastic . In short , if you watch The Garden of Allah with a lenient attitude and embrace its silliness , you can't help but enjoy it .  
  I gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes .. this is definitely really about a 5.5 .. Umm .. it was kind of bloody , had likeable , shallow characters , and it had some really hot babes in it . I like the eclectic killer , because he didn't kill people the same way everytime .. that sometimes gets old .  
  This is one of those landmark films which needs to be situated in the context of time . Darkness in Tallinn was made in 1993 . It was a period of chaos , confusion and gross disorder not only for ordinary denizens of Estonia but also for countless citizens of other former nations which were a part of mighty Soviet empire . It was in such a tense climate that a young country named Estonia was born . As newly established governments are known to encounter teething problems , Estonia too faced numerous troubles as some corrupt officials manipulated state machinery for filling their dirty pockets by making use of their selfish means . This is one of this film 's core themes . Darkness in Tallinn appears as an Estonian film but it was made by a Finnish director Ilka Järvilaturi . He has tried his best to infuse as many possible doses of Estonian humor . This is why one can call it a comedy film of political undertones . As ordinary people are involved in this film , we can say that this film signifies good versus evil . This is not a new concept as it is readily available in most of the religious books of different faiths . Darkness in Talinn shows us as to how ordinary governments can also be toppled by corrupt people . A nice film to watch on a sunny day .  
  This noir may not be the best remembered film from the era , but it features a great mystery plot , the common noir atmosphere and some good performances from its lesser known cast members . Robert Siodmak , the talented director behind the mystery / horror classic ' The Spiral Staircase ' directed this film two years earlier than the aforementioned film , and shows a real flair for creating a dark and brooding atmosphere as well as creating a plot that both intrigues and fascinates the viewer . Phantom Lady focuses on Scott Henderson ; a man married to a woman he doesn't like . He picks up a lady in a big hat in a bar one night , and the two agree to a ' no strings attached ' night of fun . However , he then returns home to find his apartment infested by police officers and soon finds out that the reason they are there is because his wife has been strangled with one of his neck ties ! He 's dismayed to find that no one he saw while with the mysterious woman can remember her , and naturally the jury sends him down for the murder of his wife . However , luckily for him his beautiful female employee gets on the case .. The plot moves along nicely throughout , and unlike many of the better known noirs , this one features a few murders which make the proceedings more interesting . In fact , if it wasn't for the fact that it was made in the forties and shot in black and white , I would swear Phantom Lady was an Italian Giallo ! The central characters are all interesting enough , with Alan Curtis providing a good portrayal of the unfortunate victim , and Ella Raines being effective as the female impromptu detective . The real standout of the film , however , is Franchot Tone , who provides a memorable performance as the insane villain of the piece . The film also features a role for supporting actor extraordinaire Elisha Cook Jr , who features playing the drums in the film 's most memorable segment . If I was to criticise this film , I would say that the identity of the murderer is revealed a little too early - although Phantom Lady does deserve some credit on that front for the original way it goes about it . The conclusion is satisfying and everything makes sense ( which is amazing considering the unlikely plot line ) and overall , Phantom Lady is surely one of the greatest and most under-seen noirs ever made !  
  For the attention of Chuck Davis and Emefy : I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago , when I was not yet a jazz buff . There is an exhibition going until end of June in Paris 's brand new MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY , named LE SIECLE DU JAZZ , not to be missed , with as a special entertainment NINE excerpts from jazz movies , including PHANTOM LADY 's famous drums sequence . I 've seen Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr - in almost all their film appearances , and I can confirm the following : 1 . Elisha Cook Jr was DUBBED in the movie . That was some progress , since in most of his other appearances he was KILLED ( mainly in Howard Hawks 's THE BIG SLEEP ) . 2 . Krupa probably dubbed Cook in PL . I could recognize his style , since he had already graduated from the tom-tom used ( and abused ) at the beginning of his career - namely in 1937 's Hollywood HOTEL 's SING , SING , SING sequence - and eventually got everything that was possible from what we call in French " la caisse claire " . 3 . The sequence from PL , at least as shown in the Museum , is not censored . harry carasso , Paris , France  
  This is a Frank Loesser masterpiece of amusing lyrics , competent themes and solid construction by those who adapted Damon Runyon material to the musical 's " book " . What is surprising about the film is how seamlessly the musical numbers flow from the storyline . Abe Burrows did the book with contributions from Loesser ; Michael Kidd was the choreographer , and the outstanding art direction was contributed by Joseph Wright . The storyline can be told in two sentences . Nathan Detroit , played by Frank Sinatra , needs cash to finance his permanent floating crap game to amuse Big Julie , a Chicago Mob Boss . He bets odds-player Sky Masterson , well-presented by Marlon Brando , that he cannot get a Salvation Army girl to go to Havana with him ; Masterson wins the bet , saves the Mission , falls in love with the girl , gets the gamblers and riffraff at the crap game to attend a service , and tells everybody the lady was impervious to his charms-a complete lie . Of course he ends up with the lady ; and Detroit marries hi long-suffering fiancée , Vivian Blaine . Others in the cast include Stubby Kaye , Johnny Silver , Robert Keith , B.S. Pulley as Big Julie the Mobster , Sheldon Leonard , Regis Toomey , Mary Alan Kokanson , Kathryn Givney as the Salvation Army leader , Veda Ann Borg and Jean Simmons as the tepid Salvation Army girl , Sarah Brown . The famous musical numbers in this award-winning Broadway smash include " Fugue For Tinhorns " , " Guys and Dolls " , " Luck Be a Lady " , " I 'll Know " , " A Person Could Develop a Cold " , and " The Oldest Established Permnanet Floating Crap Game in New York ! " . Joseph L . Mankiewicz of " Cleopatra " and " Letter to Three Wives " Fame directed the proceedings ; and the flow of the work is very interestingly and successfully kept moving . He is equally adept at getting fine dialogue acting and directing such huge numbers as " Luck Be Lady " , the varied and challenging brawl section , the Havana " A Woman in Love " section created for the film that precedes it , the presenting of the title song " Guys and Dolls " and " Pet Me , Poppa " set in the club where Blaine works . The acting is very uneven . Simmons seems wrong for the part at times , Brando gets by with the singing and is very good much of the time on instinct , charm and underplaying , even in the comedy . scenes . Sinatra tries hard but is wrong for the role for several reasons as Nathan Detroit ; Blaine is a bit too-theatrical in selling her numbers , which she of course sings professionally . Leonard , Toomey , Kaye , Keith and Pulley do what is asked and more at all points . The stylized opening and closing are made to work well ; all in all , this film is a triumph for Loesser 's amiable and subtle lyrics , for director Mankiewicz as ringmaster , and for the genre of musicals itself , so ably justified in this instance . Delightful and very different .  
  this film was almost a great imaginative film . A mixture of shakespeare , pop , jazz , and faerie tales . This movie was an imaginative twist on the Cinderella theme . Featuring a strong cast , headed by the perfectly cast Kathleen Turner , this movie had everything going for it . Everything but production values . I almost never think that a movie needs special effects or big budgets , but with an over the top production like this , it came off with the same seedy quality as every other made for tv movie . Besides better cinematography , this film was almost perfect .  
  When " Girlfight " came out , the reviews praised it , but I didn't get around to seeing it . I finally saw it when it got released on video , and understand the glowing reviews . The movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto . We quickly get introduced to student Diana Guzman ( Michelle Rodriguez ) . She has a bad-ass expression on her face , and any idea about Diana that we might derive from this expression soon gets corroborated when she gets in a fight . As Diana gets in trouble for this , we then meet her father , an aggressive type in his own right ; clearly we can't totally blame Diana for her attitude . But then the movie really picks up , as a new thought germinates in Diana 's mind : boxing as a way to escape this grim existence . Her older brother has already gotten into boxing , but her father most likely won't approve . Only Diana herself can decide what to do . Just the first few minutes alone identified that I was in for a very gritty , non-Hollywood movie , but the brief appearance of John Sayles in a supporting role truly affirmed that . Even before they get to any boxing scenes , you feel like you 're getting pounded in the face at seeing the ugly life that Diana lives . And when they finally arrive at the film 's main story , there 's no turning back . All in all , I definitely recommend this movie . I will admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to make something of himself / herself has been sort of a cliché in cinema for many years ( " Rocky " , " Million Dollar Baby " ) , but I still think that they did a great job with it here . In fact , this may have brought the genre to its apex . Really good . Too bad that Michelle Rodriguez wasted herself in Hollywood movies after this one .  
  The movie actually has a fairly good story , but gets bogged down in several key places . It 's almost as if the director threw the movie together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film . Dennis Quaid does a fairly decent job in his role .. but something is clearly missing from several key scenes . This 2.5 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie . And probably would have been a much better film had it not had the feel as if it was thrown together .  
  As essential a part of British pop culture as the Monty Python and James Bond , Doctor Who was a massive hit for 26 years ( 1963-1989 ) , making it one of the longest running TV shows in the world ( most serials are lucky to have ten seasons ) . Plans to reboot the series were always on the BBC 's agenda , and after a miscalculated ( not to mention Americanized ) TV movie produced by Fox failed to capture the magic of the original version , another nine years ( Comic Relief spoof and animated mini-series notwithstanding ) were required before the ultimate Time Lord could return properly , courtesy of acclaimed writer Russell T . Davies . Davies ' brilliance in reintroducing the character lies in his decision to do so through the eyes of an outsider : Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) , a London-based girl who leads a very normal life until one night she is attacked by creatures made out of living plastic . She is rescued by an elusive stranger who introduces himself simply as the Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) and then disappears after quipping : " Nice to meet you , Rose . Run for your life ! " . As she gets more and more curious about this " man " , she soon finds herself in a whole new world : aliens , invasions , travel through time and space , and of course , the omnipresent Police Box-shaped TARDIS . The first 45 minutes of the new Doctor Who are almost perfect ( the special effects could have used a bit more polishing ) because Davies nails two things : the show 's unique humor and the two protagonists . The original series ' most endearing trait was its blend of spectacular sci-fi and pure British comedy , a hybrid that 's hard , if not impossible , to export . Here the laughs are all linked to the conversations between Rose and the Doctor , who come off as fully rounded characters after just one episode . Okay , so technically Eccleston 's Doctor is the Ninth to use that name , but he distances himself from the previous eight incarnations by speaking with a Northern accent ( the one he uses on a daily basis ) and justifying it with a terrific line : " Lots of planets have a North ! " . The real triumph of this episode , though , is Piper 's performance : in theory , Rose is in her late teens , therefore nearly the same age as thousands of young viewers who had never heard of the Doctor before . Her portrayal of an ordinary girl lost in a new , exciting universe , represents the new generation 's reaction to the return of a TV icon , and the chemistry that instantly forms between her and Eccleston is a sign indicating the new Doctor Who is just as good as the old one . First , fifth , ninth , it makes no difference : there may have been others before Eccleston ( and Piper , for that matter ) but together he , William Hartnell , Peter Davison and the rest of the bunch are one single character , one so cool he doesn't even need a name : he 's THE Doctor .  
  Paris , JE T'AIME is a wondrous cinematic homage to the city of light and the city of love , a film so complex that it almost defies summarization and reviewing . Ask a large group of people their impressions of life in Paris and the result would be something akin to this film . Tied together by each of the sectors or Arrondissement of the city , the film examines love in all forms , native folk in their Parisian modes , and tourists interacting with the great city . Approximately twenty writers and directors , each with about five minutes of screen time , include Olivier Assayas , the Coen Brothers , Sylvain Chomet , Isabel Coixet , Wes Craven , ALfonso Cuarón , Gérard Depardieu , Christopher Doyle , Vincenzo Natali , Alexander Payne , Walter Salles , Nobuhiro Suwa , and Gus Van Sant among others less well known . The stories vary from hilarious , to humorous , to touching , to tragic , to banal , to tender . In one story a young Frenchman ( Gaspard Ulliel ) is attracted to a young lithographer ( Elias McConnell ) , pouring out his heart in French to a lad who speaks only English . In another a separated husband and wife ( Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara ) meet in the Latin Quarter to finalize divorce proceedings while another couple in Père-Lachaise ( Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell ) approach marriage without connection until the spirit of departed Oscar Wilde intervenes . Steve Buscemi in Tuileries confronts superstition in a subway with his bag of tourist collections , in Bastille Sergio Castellitto ( in love with mistress Leonor Watling ) is ready to divorce his wife Miranda Richardson until she confides she has terminal leukemia , Juliette Binouche confronts agony about her son 's fantasies and loss in Place des Victoires with the help of a mythical cowboy Willem Defoe , Sara Martins and Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier display a keen tale of mistaken ideas in Parc Monceau , Fanny Ardant and Bob Hoskins ' play out ' a strange relationship in Pigalle , Melchior Beslon plays a young blind man to actress Natalie Portman in learning how to see in Faubourg Saint-Denis , vampire love between Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko in Quartier de la Madeleine , Maggie Gyllenhaal is an ex-patriot actress stung out on drugs in Quartier des Enfants Rouges , and Margo Martindale is a visiting tourist letter carrier trying desperately to speak the French she has studied for her life 's trip in a tenderly hilarious 14ème Arrondissement . The final few minutes of the film tries to tie together as many of the stories as feasible , but this only works on superficial levels . The film is long and there are no bridges between the many stories , a factor that can tire the audience due to lack of time to assimilate all of the action . But it is in the end a richly detailed homage to a great city and supplies the viewer with many vignettes to re-visit like a scrapbook of a time in Paris . It is a film worth seeing multiple times !

  Generally , it 's difficult to rate these cut - & - paste films . Some of the segments can be quite good while others bring down the rating of the overall product . In this one , for instance , the all-girl scene in the Doctor 's office was quite exciting .. one of the best in this viewer 's ( limited ) viewing history . Then there 's Asia 's segment .. the lady is always entertaining . And the story that binds the whole together was an interesting concept . The swap scene that closes out the offering ain't bad either . Technically , the production values are fairly high . Recommended .  
  This was one of the best war movies I 've seen because it focuses on the characters more then the actual war . All of the cast do an excellent job and because most of them are relative unknowns it makes everything seem more believable . The camera footage is great is so was the pacing and editing . This movie will actually get to you and causes the audience to care for the charcters .  
  War drama that takes place in Louisiana in 1971 . It follows a bunch of recruits through basic training and then Tigerland-an accurate portrayal of Vietnam on American soil , before they 're shipped over . It focuses on two men-Booz ( Colin Farrell ) and Paxton ( Matthew Davis ) .. how they meet , become friends and deal with a corwardly squadron leader ( Clifton Collins Jr . ) and a borderline psycho ( Shea Wingham ) . A surprisingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher . He uses a hand-held camera throughout most of the movie and uses digital video for the combat scenes . It works very well-the film looks gritty ( as it should ) and uncomfortably realistic . Farrell successfully covers up his Irish brogue and adopts a pretty convincing Southern accent . His performance is just superb-he 's an extremely talented young man . Davis , unfortunately , is not that good . He 's tall , muscular , very handsome-and very bland . The rest of the cast however is just great . This film was thrown away by its studio . It had no stars in it , a familar story and was considered " just another war film " . It only played a week in Boston ! It 's well worth catching on video or DVD . Also , Farrell and Davis have a lengthy nude scene .  
  I 've never seen many online movies in most of my life , but if I 'd pick any of them , I 'd pick Spatula Madness , A clever reference to most movies like star trooper ( etc . ) , using a camera , and wits of steel , Jason Steele mastered the art of turning a normal image into a painting , and then putting it all together with frame-by-frame animation to get a world inhabited by spatulas . the story begins at the middle , hows that for directors delight ? then the middle is at the beginning , and so on , when I first watched it , I expected a soggy pixely look , but Jason , Like me , Loves looks , so took every detail to the max . although I don't recommend it for children , or would anybody besides me like it , but please search it up on the net ( its a short film , look up film cow ) , its style reminds me of south park , but less violent . 10 for the look , 6 for the laughs , and 6 for the story , it all comes to a 10/10 , good work Jason Steele , I 'm anxious to see the movie .  
  This short film that inspired the soon-to-be full length feature - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers . The short film stars Edward the Spatula who after being fired from his job , joins in the fight against the evil spoons . This premise allows for some funny content near the beginning , but is barely present for the remainder of the feature . This film 's 15-minute running time is absorbed by some odd-ball comedy and a small musical number . Unfortunately not much else lies below it . The plot that is set up doesn't really have time to show . But it 's surely follows it plot better than many high-budget Hollywood films . This film is worth watching at least a few times . Take it for what it is , and don't expect a deep story .  
  I remember watching this film on Saturday afternoon TV in the 1950s or 60s . It was well presented but I do remember there was a message of hope broadcast from transmitters secreted in lamposts in one of the last maniacal executions for impending liberation . I 'm not sure that squares with the facts . Still the film is well done . The German High Command reports wryly without emotion " The Russians are advancing down The Fredrich Strasse " as if all went according to plan . it was my impression that this film and a later American made for TV knock-off was based on the British historian Trevor-Roper 's account by a similar title Last Days of Hitler . I was surprised to see no credit to Trevor-Roper . I agree the newest German film on the subject DOWNFALL was as well done as the classic . The American knock-off was a little flat . Few figures have attracted as much attention from the cinema as Adolph . Yet I find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out ever speak of Hitler 's double alluded to in passing in John Toland 's magnificent historical piece . Was gibs ?  
  Oh , come on , learn to have a little fun . When I was a kid , oh , this movie was Oscar-worthy to me . I thought it was absolutely hysterical . One of the best movies I had seen . Now , it 's a little stupid , but come on . If you enjoyed " Excellent Adventure " , you should most likely have fun with " Bogus Journey " . This was the movie before " Dude , where 's my car ? " . Only this one is actually funny . Like I said , it 's just a good time . It shouldn't be taken seriously and if you enjoyed the first one , you should like " Bogus Journey " . It 's just a funny movie with some memorable characters . For your enjoyment only , watch it , let go , and remember that it 's a silly comedy . That 's all . 7/10  
  The world of the Dragon Hunters is a 3D gravity challenged world . Planetoids , bits of buildings and strange flat plants float around in the atmosphere while the ground towards most of the characters are falling is nowhere to be seen . It is a world reminiscent of Neverending Story , when the Nothing came to eat the world away . Funny enough , the villain here is the World Gobbler , as well . This time it is a huge skeleton dragon with fiery eyes . The heroes are a big yet taciturn warrior , an annoying and greedy sidekick managing the entrepreneurial side of the duo and a strange useless animal . They are joined by the most talkative little girl in the world who , to my chagrin , did not die a horrible painful and hopefully early death . The animation is great . The voices and the sounds are top notch . Too bad the story is as simple as one can possibly imagine . They go to stop the World Gobbler , they reach him almost immediately , they defeat him . The end . No real character development or story twists . Not even the ones I would expect from a movie with such a plot . Bottom line : it 's a cute thing to watch , kids would probably enjoy it , but that 's about it . No depth to this world ( pun intended ) .  
  I saw this film in the worst possible circumstance . I 'd already missed 15 minutes when I woke up to it on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul . I didn't know what I was watching , I thought maybe it was a movie of the week , but quickly became riveted by the performance of the lead actress playing a young woman who 's child had been kidnapped . The premise started taking twist and turns I didn't see coming and by the end credits I was scrambling through the the in-flight guide to figure out what I had just watched . Turns out I was belatedly discovering Do-yeon Jeon who 'd won Best Actress at Cannes for the role . I don't know if Secret Sunshine is typical of Korean cinema but I 'm off to the DVD store to discover more .  
  I can't believe others took such a serious view of all this . God , it was a lot of fun rooting for Hop-a-long Cassidy . It was a great tribute to the Western serials of years ago . It wasn't meant to be a great cinema experience , except it was . So what if there wasn't a big special effects bonanza . It was a fun , tongue in cheek , look at old Western 's . Man , relax and enjoy .  
  Jerome Crabbe has the lead role in this movie . I saw this movie 6 times and I still am not tired of it . This movie is similar to Flesh + Blood in some ways . Gerald Soetman is a great writer . He wrote all of Paul Verhoeven 's Dutch films . Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors . I have seen all of his movies all except for Showgirls . My Mom does not like him so much but I disagree . I think all of his films are a ride to watch especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct . Jerry Goldsmith did some of his movies which include Total Recall , Basic Instinct and Hollow Man . I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died . Dutch films are different but still enjoyable .  
  When you read the summary of this film , you might come to think that this is something of an odd film and in some ways it is , for the primary character of this film , Gerard Reve ( Jeroen Krabbé ) is haunted by visions and hallucinations . The visions Gerard see are all ( more or less ) subtle hints to what will happen to him as the story continues and it is great fun for the viewer to try and figure out the symbolism used in the film . Despite the use of symbolism and a couple of hints to the ending of the film , the film maintains a very high level of excitement throughout and does not get boring for one minute . This is mostly due to the great performances of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk ( Christine ) and the great direction of the whole by Paul Verhoeven . His directing style is clearly visible and one can say , looking at it from different angles , that ' De Vierde Man ' is a typical Verhoeven film . It will not only seem typical for people familiar with his American films because of the nudity and the graphic violent scenes , but it will also seem typical for people familiar with his Dutch films , because of the same things and his talent to tell a great story . When people watch Verhoevens American films , short sighted people might say , he has no talent in telling a good story and only focuses on blood and sex . That is what some people think , whereas I think that he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each with each film . Although not a good film , Hollow Man ( his last American film ) is an example that Verhoeven can do more than science fiction splatter movies and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more various films to helm . He needs that . Just watch his Dutch films . Not only do they show that he needs a certain amount of freedom , but they also show that he has remarkable talent . ' De Vierde Man ' brought him one step closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of his best . 8 out of 10  
  This movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence which tricked me into a complete reversal of perspective , so I was hooked by the time the title came on . The theme of this movie is that everyone is acting , trying to re-invent themselves , but not in a tricky way like Identity or the Usual Suspects , but in the way we all try to make whatever banal life we find ourselves in a little more interesting . The scenes in the chicken warehouses are spectacular . At one point Jorgen ( who owns the chicken farm ) attends a seminar in laughing , where he 's the worst student . His discomfort at this lets you see the depth of his yearning to change himself . The movie made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most commonplace people I see every day . There 's not a lot of plot here . Guessing the old man 's secret is pretty easy , but the fascination lies in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they figure it out . This movie appealed to me in the same way that Sideways did , although the characters couldn't be more dissimilar .  
  This is right up at the top of my list of the most hysterically funny shows I 've ever seen . I laughed so hard , I 'm sure I missed half the jokes . This showcases Izzard as the brilliantly gifted comedian he is . What I particularly like is that he seems never to be " dumbing down " the material for his audience . His timing is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a performance piece rather than just a series of gags . Thumbs way up .  
  This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I 've seen and so far the funniest one . In this one , Joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman . When he goes to Warner Bros . Studio ( the company behind this series , incidentally ) , he asks Jack Carson for directions which gets both confused . Then he encounters actor George O'Hanlon ( who 's also McDoakes ) who speaks in his more normal voice that 's not too far from his later Geroge Jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director . I 'll stop there and just say how funny I found the whole thing and was fascinated by the movie star cameos provided near the end . The final scene was especially a hoot so on that note , go to YouTube if you want to watch So You Want to Be in Picutres !  
  I have previously seen Zu : Warriors from the Magic Mountain . In that film , the setting takes place in China 's mountains , the Legend of Zu looks like another dimension ! Thank that to Tsui Hark 's extensive use of CGI effects . He 's able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds , a land where beings fly freely , and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades , split swords , and the ultra cool Moon Orb . While there are many characters in this one , the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma . The romance aspect is there , although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor . Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching . In the beginning , I like how she resembles the Countess ( from Zu Warriors ) and she does well playing Enigma as she deals with facing her past life . Oh , by the way , did I mention that Cecilia 's very appealing to the eye ? In truth , Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 . Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema .  
  This film is amazing and I would recommend to child and adult alike . The animation is beautiful , the characters are rich and interesting , and the story is captivating ; far better than anything the American studios were producing at the time . However , there is a couple of caveats to this statement . It 's a shame that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli back-catalogue and then proceeded to butcher it . My main point being , Disney re-dubbed the film , despite the original English version being very impressive . The new cast with Van Der Beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters e . g . Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers . The Original music score is also far better than the Disney remix . It begs the question why did Disney make such changes ? It seems to me is that by having Van Der Beek et al being cast then Disney can draw in more money , which is fair enough , but in the process they tainted they film . It is still a beautiful film and I would still recommend it to anyone . My main beef is that Disney ruined a film from childhood which I loved and still love . I am lucky enough to have an original Japanese import with the original English dub which I am now going to guard with my life !  
  I know Anime . I 've been into it long before it became a national phenomenon ; i loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z even was . And just so you know I 'm not bragging about my , let me say this : out of all the animes I 've seen , Castle in the Sky is by far one of the best . It 's obvious people say Spirited Away is the best , but I really disagree . Most people only know that movie because it one an Acedmy Award ; this isn't an exaggeration - I 've shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who 'd only ever seen Spirited Away , and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three . Personally , I 'd never thought that anything could compare to Princess Mononoke , until I finally saw Castle in the Sky . I still think that the prior is the better of the two , but Castle in the Sky is easily on par with it ; in many ways , Castle has major elements that Mononoke was missing . In either case , if you 've only seen Spirited Away , and think that that is Miyazaki 's best film , be prepared to have your earth shaken .  
  I first saw this back in the early 90s on UK TV , i did like it then but i missed the chance to tape it , many years passed but the film always stuck with me and i lost hope of seeing it TV again , the main thing that stuck with me was the end , the hole castle part really touched me , its easy to watch , has a great story , great music , the list goes on and on , its OK me saying how good it is but everyone will take there own best bits away with them once they have seen it , yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to watch , it does show its age in a very few parts but that has now become part of it beauty , i am so glad it has came out on DVD as it is one of my top 10 films of all time . Buy it or rent it just see it , best viewing is at night alone with drink and food in reach so you don't have to stop the film . Enjoy  
  Strangely erotic schlock Gothic horror that will be loved by Hammer House of Horror fans the world over . Appears to be an interesting take on " Beauty and the Beast " . It is definitely worth a look and surprisingly well acted when taking into consideration the genre and era . Corsets , castles , rutting horses , rampaging faux fur monsters in the woods , proof that no-one had a Brazilian in the 70 's , and more bodily fluids than you can shake a stick at , what more could you possibly want ? ! It certainly brightened my Sunday afternoon !  
  I like this movie much , it 's special type of humor by Ondricek and Machacek .. I think it 's better then Samotari ( Loners ) .. Maybe it 's difficult to understand when you are not Czech . If you are not watching that movie , just enjoy it , don't mind about anything else .. just relax !  
  For a while I was caught in the trap where I found myself watching independent and foreign films and lying to myself that I liked them . Fatty Drives the Bus is the exception . It is the truth . It is the best " bad " movie ever . The " badness " of this movie seems to come naturally . Halfway through Satan 's opening monologue , the word " Hell " appears at the bottom of the screen . The glamorous Bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and a thrift store dress . It takes the eccentric couple that keeps trying to kill each other FOREVER to walk down the stairs . Jesus walks to a funk soundtrack . Anyways , Fatty gives the impression that someone lost their tenure for advising a senior 's film project . But it 's the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful . You get the impression the makers knew it was going to be bad , but never forced it . Never to be duplicated in wonder , Fatty delivers . Highly highly recommended .  
  What a stunning episode for this fine series . This is television excellence at its best . The story takes place in 1968 and it 's beautifully filmed in black & white , almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images . This is a story about two men who fall in love , but I don't want to spoil this . It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America . Written by the superb Tom Pettit , and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc , we move through their lives , their love for each other , and their tragedy . Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning . Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters . Chills ran up my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan 's gorgeous , " Ah , but I was so much older then , I 'm younger than that now , " as sung by the Byrds . This one goes far past a 10 and all the way to the stars . Beautiful .  
  Before Cujo , there was Lucky the devil dog . In 1978 , on Halloween night the movie " Devil Dog , The Hound of Hell " premiered . A story of a family getting a new puppy ( from a farmer who just happen to be in the neighborhood selling fruits and vegetables ) because their dog Skipper was killed . Coencidence ? Everyone loves the new dog , but there is something strange about him . It isn't long until the father Mike Barry ( Richard Crenna , First Blood ) starts to notice . His wife Betty ( Yvette Mimieux , Where The Boys Are , Jackson County Jail , Snowbeast ) is different and his kids Charlie and Bonnie ( Ike Eisenman , Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards , Witch Mountain , Nanny and the Professor , Hello Larry , Tuff-Turf ) also have changed . Does the dog have something to do with it ? He 's determined to find out and do whatever it takes to save his family . This movie is great because it has Ike and Kim playing a darker side of themselves than what we saw on those witch mountain movies . This is one of the many 70 's made-for-TV horror movies that was actually scary for a made-for-TV horror movie . The music was creepy and even the ending which I won't tell made you think . This movie also stars Ken Kercheval ( Cliff Barnes of Dallas ) and R.G. Armstrong ( who couldn't stay away from devil movies remember " Race with the Devil " ? ) It 's worth watching .  
  This film is a spicy little piece of film-making from Sam Fuller which gives Richard Widmark the chance to show of some of his best , most edgy acting in the role of Skip McCoy , a small-time thief who stumbles onto a military secret while picking beautiful Candy 's ( Jean Peters ) pocket on a crowded bus . It turns out Candy was doing a favor for her ( ex ? ) boyfriend , who 's working for the " commies " . Superficially , there 's a mystery here regarding Candy 's motives and Skip spends much of the film determining her motives . Actually he seems to just initially assume that she 's a " commie " , going so far as to pour beer in her face in a callous gesture . But the real question is  what 's going on with Skip ? What are his motives , and why does Candy like him so much ? Why do we ( the audience ) want to like him so much ? Basically what the film-makers have done here is create a very striking " male fatale " in Widmark 's character and his performance . Just as the male audience tends to ponder through the length of a film like " The Big Sleep " or " The Glass Key " along with the main characters whether the female character is trustworthy or just a pretty face , the film-makers have here created a similar quandary for female viewers . Widmark is handsome , and there 's also a charm in his boyish insouciance  but the first two times he meets our leading lady , he robs her and then punches her in the face . Eventually the question becomes  would Skip sink so low as to sell out his country for a buck ( his comments to the police , like " you 're waving a flag at ME ? " make us suspect he would ) or is he simply out for revenge for the murder of his friend Moe ( Thelma Ritter ) ? I 'm not sure that the film gives us a conclusive answer either way . Thelma Ritter 's character work deserves special mention  she has created a truly indelible character here . Fuller isn't afraid to give her plenty of " business "  in the form of physical objects that she uses to draw the audience into her world , particularly her used ties . Another example of Fuller 's " business " would be the scene with Victor Perry ( an actor I 've seen elsewhere used to less effect ) using the chopsticks to intimidate Candy . The emphasis on Moe 's relationship with Skip provides one of cinema 's most revealing " honor among thieves " themes . In fact Skip has the same kind of ease and the same kind of casual relationship with the police , with the notable exception of Capt . Tiger ( Murvyn Vye ) who has a grudge against him . I loved the scene where he invited the cops in by name and offered them a beer when they came to pick him up at his shack . Those are the kind of details that make this film feel real  whether or not it really is " realistic " or whether that would matter are entirely separate questions . All told , I would say this is an essential crime film which displays a lot of the best and most durable attributes of the " film noir " school of film-making . A predictable plot is off-set by a host of colorful characters ( uniformly well-performed ) , cheap sets are disguised by the film 's unrelenting pace , and the final product feels a lot more substantial than it probably is . This is the best film I 've seen so far by Sam Fuller and helps me to see better why he 's regarded as a master director  here he accomplished some things that I think he tried but ultimately failed to do in other films like " The Crimson Kimono " and " Shock Corridor " as far as very emphatic acting styles and really gripping suspense . This is one of my favorite performances from Widmark that I 've seen so far  and Widmark was a talent that I 'm tempted to say ( based on the few extraordinary films I 've seen with him ) was comparable to that of Alan Ladd or Humphrey Bogart , although arguably he didn't make as many classic films .  
  Pickup On South Street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made . An example of the directing : When Candy ( Jean Peters ) starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing , an alarm goes off in the background in the building she 's in - as if it 's an alarm going off in her head . It 's not cartoon-like - it 's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you 've seen the film a few times and it just " clicks " that there 's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag . Richard Widmark is way on top of his game as a smart-alec - he 's really great - but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for " Moe , " the street peddler / informer , played by Thelma Ritter . Later , in her apartment , you are not seeing a movie - you 're seeing a real person . I 've never seen anyone " act " so real I felt like I was looking into a real room until Ritter 's performance - right down to the way her hair stuck out a bit when she removed her hat . About a million other things just * worked , * from the way Lightning Louie picks up money with his chopsticks to the way Candy 's jewelry clicks when she flicks Moe 's hand away from her brooch , to the way Moe gets the dollars and change from the police captain across the FBI guy 's chest - and even the way the captain opens his filing cabinet , like he 's been doing it in that way in that room for many years . " Pickup On South Street " is detailed moves ( directing ) with consummate performances ( acting ) and superb now-nostalgic visuals of the day , such as the panel truck , the boards leading to the shack out on the water , the dumbwaiter , - and the unforgettable place Skip stashes his pocket pickings . Wonderful stuff . " Pickup On South Street " is also one of the few movies where , even though the characters aren't perfect , you do care about them - perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape : Skip as a " three-time loser " and Candy as a youngish woman who has " knocked around " a lot . When these people behave a little more badly than you 'd expect , it 's in sort of novel ways that make it seem you 're looking in at people you 'd never otherwise imagine - and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human .  
  I loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact . While I like when a episode of Columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one , its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode , along with the uncovering of the murderer . The interplay between Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon is priceless . At one point , Gordon , playing a famous writer , makes some comment about being flattered by the famous Lt . Columbo , making a tongue-in-cheek allusion to the detective 's real life fame as a crime-solver . This is one of the best of many great Columbo installments .  
  I would like to comment on the movie April Love . It 's one of my all time favorites because my father , Nelson Malone plays the horse trainer . I remember distinctly when Hollywood came to Lexington , KY , where we were living at the time to make April Love . My Dad had been in numerous plays and was a talented man . I talked him into going to try out for one of the bit parts offered , and lo and behold he came home w / the script . How exciting is that ! Also , a number of my classmates were in the crowd scenes - especially the ones shown at the amusement park . It 's very nostalgic every April when I see the movie being shown once again , and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still played on the radio . Timeless and reminiscent of a time long gone when you see the movies they make today w / all the sex , foul language and violence . It would be refreshing to see more movies like April Love come back into focus ..  
  this is what i call a great movie . it lives trough the fantastic actor skills and a simple but human story . there are real characters which can be funny and dramatic . but the main theme is very cruel , like live is . the bus driver and his son are collecting people trough the country ( jugoslavia ) on their way to the capital Belgrad . the funny and cruel situations that happens on the way , connect the people and the pigs that travel together . watch it and you gonna remember it for life .. its filled with Slavic humor and lifestyle . and another reason for its magic : it is hard to get !  
  I have to be 100 % honest with you fellow IMDb users . I wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster . Doesn't Charlotte Gainsbourg looks extremely sexy and charming smiling that way ? I 'm in love with that woman ! I got what I expected .. but only half . This film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations . While I don't agree with another fellow IMDb user who states that the movie is overrated ; I must admit that " Préte-moi ta main " has plenty of flaws . My main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters . There isn't a single scene previous to the climax that shows the main characters sharing a moment " of romance " or even a clue to suggest that they 're interested in each other . In fact , the only scene were both share a moment is tremendously awkward ( when both are in the couch ) and does not help the audience understand about a possible love interest . I didn't buy the dinner sequence . Still , the movie delivers very funny moments and has a strong dialogs that support such an ingenuous premise . I mean with ingenuous that it would be very difficult to execute such a farse by a 43 year old man in these days . I understand it 's a movie and that 's why I accept it as a funny situation . Plus , the humor is versatile . There are moments involving S & M , funny lines with Chabat 's best friend , some lesbian references , funny situations involving the family women , and more . Charlotte Gaionsbourg 's performance is top notch and she 's by far the reason to watch the movie . She 's funny , sexy , looks very thin and fine , and demonstrates she 's a versatile and talented actress who can pull out a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance . Alain Chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance . I think the supporting cast do what they can . The score , art direction , and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the film . Those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the ending credits . It 's a good example of feel good cinema .  
  If you have not seen this excellent movie about life in the 90s ( in L.A. ) then you 've missed a special treat . This is one of the most amazingly and most powerful movies ever made about life for Americans in the 90s and it even carries over into today 's world in which we live in . It covers everything from raising a child , prejudice ( more than one way ) , love , adultery , empty nest syndrome , selfishness , etc .. and the list goes on . This story builds up to an ultimate climax and then when nothing else matters it always goes back to love with friends and family and love of life . It helps us dig deep within ourselves and to make us search for what we want out of life . Makes us ask questions of ourselves . Have we done enough for others , are we like this , etc . ? Sit back and enjoy a wonderfully done and emotional movie that I 'm sure others will enjoy for a lifetime . Take note of Mary Mcdonnell , Kevin Kline and Danny Glover 's wonderful performance through this whole film . These actors are amazing and really show the true glow and meaning of what message is being sent to all of us . These are 3 of my favorite actors for life after seeing this film over 10 years ago now . I still enjoy it again and again . Also enjoy the wonderful soundtrack with it and don't forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly by and try to figure out it 's symbolism for the movie ? hmm .. I almost forgot this is probably Steve Martin 's very first serious acting role in any film he has ever done . He , too does an excellent job in this movie . This may come as a surprise to most of you . Sit back , relax and enjoy truly good film making ..  
  Grand Canyon falls under a very scarce category : it is a very clever film , with very clever dialogs and food for thought everywhere from start to end . I have the impression that it never made it to it 's deserved ranking ( and never will ) , because of it 's simplicity . This kind of flick needs sensitive watchers . Pity thought that IMDb makes me write ten lines , because this is in no way necessary in this particular case . Anyway in order to fulfill this request , I will tell you that the weak point of the film if any is in the acting : not that it is bad but it could have been done much better . Exception made for Kevin Kline who was perfect . Go ahead and watch it .  
  Murder in Mesopotamia , I have always considered one of the better Poirot books , as it is very creepy and has an ingenious ending . There is no doubt that the TV adaptation is visually striking , with some lovely photography and a very haunting music score . As always David Suchet is impeccable as Hercule Poirot , the comedic highlight of the episode being Poirot 's battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night , and Hugh Fraser is good as the rather naive Captain Hastings . The remainder of the cast turn in decent performances , but are careful not to overshadow the two leads , a danger in some Christie adaptations . Some of the episode was quite creepy , a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as Five Little Pigs , an episode that I enjoyed a lot more than this one . What made it creepy in particular , putting aside the music was when Louise Leidner sees the ghostly face through the window . About the adaptation , it was fairly faithful to the book , but I will say that there were three things I didn't like . The main problem was the pacing , it is rather slow , and there are some scenes where very little happens . I didn't like the fact also that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer . In the book , I see him as a rather nervous character , but the intervention of the idea of making him a murderer , and under-developing that , made him a less appealing character , though I am glad they didn't miss his drug addiction . ( I also noticed that the writers left out the fact that Mrs Mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the murderer 's next victim . ) The other thing that wasn't so impressive was that I felt that it may have been more effective if the adaptation had been in the viewpoint of Amy Leatheran , like it was in the book , Amy somehow seemed less sensitive in the adaptation . On the whole , despite some misjudgements on the writers ' behalf , I liked Murder in Mesopotamia . 7/10 Bethany Cox .  
  Paul Reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family - what we see and what we don't see , what we expect and what surprises us . THE THING ABOUT MY FOLKS doesn't set any new standards for film , but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents . Sam Kleinman ( Peter Falk ) has been a workaholic , at times pushing his wife Muriel ( Olympia Dukakis ) , his daughters ( Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan ) , and his son Ben ( Paul Reiser ) into the background . One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving ! Her daughters , along with Ben 's wife Rachel ( Elizabeth Perkins ) immediately begin the search for her whereabouts , leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle Sam to sort things out on a road trip with son Ben . The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members . Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living . The trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of Muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story 's warm ending . All is not what it seemed : it 's better and , well , different . Falk and Reiser play off each other like the pros they are , but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when Olympia Dukakis is on screen , reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film . Well worth viewing . Grady Harp  
  I also viewed this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival . It was an excellent film about adult family relationships . Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities to his family . It was funny , warm , poignant , and moving , as well as entertaining . A film like this would do very well with the word of mouth reviews . I would definitely tell my friends and family to see this film . Let 's only hope they 'll have the chance . I would rate this film as one of the best movies I 've seen in a year . It contains no violence , action scenes , murders , sex , so evidently distributors question whether or not to pick it up . Believe me , there are people out there who would love to go see a movie like this that has redeeming value , instead of the many typical big box office blockbusters we are usually given .  
  Two thirds of nearly 2,000 IMDb users who have voted on this film have rated it at 8 , 9 or 10 and one user reports wearing out six videotapes ( Was this a record , or merely a faulty VCR ? ) . Although the film is primarily intended as a period piece it clearly has a quite unusual fascination . But for some reason I imagined it as largely whimsy and until recently never felt the urge to watch it . My mind was changed by Elizbeth Von Arnim 's original book . My wife loves reading but her sight no longer allows her to read much so she borrowed it in talking book form . Such books are usually irritating to a companion who is busy with other things , but I gradually came to appreciate that this one was seductively soothing , although in no way syrupy , and was also very well written . I realised my wife would enjoy watching the film , and so decided to buy her the videotape . I am now very glad that I did , and would certainly recommend its purchase to anyone else who appreciates a quiet reflective work with no fireworks but with well constructed character development and a very successful pre-Mussolini Italian atmosphere . The story is set in the immediate post WW1 period and starts with two married London ladies who decide to pool their savings and enjoy a holiday together , away from their families , in a rented villa in Italy . Force of circumstances lead to this couple being joined by two others with very different characters and backgrounds . Its theme is essentially no more than the interactions that take place as their holiday progresses , not only between these four very disparate mature ladies , but also with the occasional male visitor . If you want action , thrills , dramatic sex scenes , natural or man-made disasters , or Harlequin style romances this would not be the film for you . But IMDb users have collectively and very emphatically demonstrated that none of these are necessary for a film to prove highly rewarding to watch , and if you care to give it a try you may , as I did , come to rank it among your much loved films . It is fairly rare for me to watch a film of a book with which I am already familiar . In many cases I find this takes some of the pleasure away from watching the film , but here there is such a strong visual appeal in the setting that I actually found my pleasure augmented by the anticipation of seeing the next segment of the book , effectively unrolled before my eyes . ( Perhaps Italy itself has some part in this , the last time I had this experience was when I was watching tales from Boccaccio 's Decameron on TV . ) Generally films of books tend to increase the dramatic level of the original work to ensure that the filmed version has an even wider appeal , but here if anything it is reduced in order to keep the viewers attention on the gradual character development rather than on any background events . This works very well , although changes from the book are few and basically the film remains true to the original story . Great credit is due to the Director , Mike Newell , and all members of the cast , particularly those well known British Actresses who play the four principal ladies .  
  This was probably one of the most well-made films of the 40 's - Warner Bros . at the very height of their style . The photography by Sol Polito is arguably his finest achievement - gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing . Max Steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the epitome of his classical leit motif method . The music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable . It 's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make " Now , Voyager " later that year - a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite , ciefly because it starred Bette Davis . IN my opinion , " The Gay Sisters " is a much better film - better made in all departments , and more interesting , complex and enjoyable . A most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is , rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection . Each thing has to be judged in it 's own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms . Most of the complaints I 've read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point . If you 're hungry for a perfect filet mignon , don't go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry . The art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population . Sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the Rolling Stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots , you 'd all be gleefully gratified . I 'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week !  
  This is a very exciting and romantic film . I have seen it several times and never get bored with it . Everything is realistic and it is a good plot . The actors are excellent Liam Neeson , Jessica Lange , Tim Roth and Brian Cox . I actually prefer this film to Braveheart as Braveheart contain so many historical misstakes . There is many exciting scenes - watch out for the Bridge Scen and the last fencing scene . This is really good and surprising scenes . The music are lovely .. it really suits to the movie . The setting is amazing .  
  In the process of trying to establish the audiences ' empathy with Jake Roedel ( Tobey Maguire ) the filmmakers slander the North and the Jayhawkers . Missouri never withdrew from the Union and the Union Army was not an invading force . The Southerners fought for State 's Rights : the right to own slaves , elect crooked legislatures and judges , and employ a political spoils system . There 's nothing noble in that . The Missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the Confederate Army . It seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity . When Jake leaves the Bushwhackers , it 's not because he saw error in his way , he certainly doesn't give himself over to the virtue of the cause of abolition .  
  I enjoyed this film very much . Tobey Maguire gives a terrific performance as Jake . He has got to be one of the best actors I have seen . And I was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film . He was extremely good at this too although I have never seen him deliver a comic line before . The film gets you involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what is to become of them all . I did not know what to expect from Jewel 's performance but I think she did rather well . Lots of exciting scenes . A thoroughly good ride . I am absolutely a fan of Maguire 's . Check out Cider House Rules . One of the all time Best Ever .  
  I saw this film and heard the writer-director , Juan Gerard , speak at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival . All I knew about it was that it was the story of an 8-year-old boy at the time of the Cuban Revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family . Its opening scene will bring to mind " Cinema Paradiso " . In fact , the film is filled with references to classic films : The Roulette Wheel ( Casablanca ) , " chicken clucking " ( Rebel Without a Cause ) , references to Bunuel , " Touch of Evil " ; you 'll find more . The homeless man ( Georg Stanford Brown ) is a reference to Cuban folklore which often uses a black man as a type of Greek chorus . What this film really is is the culmination of a dream . Gerard 's wish to honor his family and medium of film that he has loved all of his life . This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people in it are real , as are the events depicted . Gerard is actually an architect and engineer ( and passionate film lover ) but his dream was to make this movie . He and his wife decided to live that dream and Harvey Keitel became an " angel " who believed in Gerard and agreed to produce and star in it . Keitel holds the screen powerfully as the mysterious and secretive grandfather " Che " . Brown and Keitel are the only Americans in the cast . Iben Hjejle ( High Fidelity ) and Gael Garcia Bernal ( Y tu Mama Tambien ) offer strong support in key roles . Truthfully , the first half of the film suffers from stiff delivery of lines , and some overracting , but stay with it . The last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet , and honest climax . It is the first effort of Juan Gerard , but it is honest as he is and his passion and heart really come through , in this sincere first effort . I would definitely see it again , and hope that he continues his film career .  
  Most italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie since because it has no connection to the first two Demons films . And with the " Demons II " in the title , one would assume it would . The problem is that this film was never intended to be part of the Demons series . The distributors only a " Demons II " above its original title " The Ogre " to cash in on the other films popularity . The new American DVD release of this picture has the title " Demons II : The Ogre " on the box art but the film itself only says " The Ogre " . I don't know if past releases had the title " Demons II " on the actual film itself , but this new release just seems to be a little white lie . If you can get past the " Demons II " in the title , you might some enjoyment in " The Ogre " . It starts out with a creep intro , and stays pretty creep throughout . There 's no gore and the film movies slowly , but I still dug it . Just don't expect it to be like the other Demons films . I give " The Ogre " 7 out of 10 . Italian fans should try it out .  
  I really liked this movie . I have seen several Gene Kelly flicks and this is one of his best . I would actually put it above his more famous American in Paris . Sometimes it seems the story gets lost in Gene Kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers , but not in this movie . It is definitely worth renting .  
  This film ( like Astaire 's ROYAL WEDDING - which was shown after it on Turner Classic Network last night ) is famous for a single musical sequence that has gained a place in Gene Kelly 's record : Like Fred Astaire dancing with a clothing rack and later dancing around a room 's walls and ceiling , this film had Gene Kelly dancing in a cartoon sequence with Jerry Mouse . The sequence is nicely done . What is forgotten is that Kelly is telling the story behind the cartoon sequence to Dean Stockwell and his fellow child students at school during a break in the day , and sets the stage for the sequence by having Stockwell and the others shut their eyes and imagine a pastoral type of background . Kelly even changes the navy blues he actually wears into a white " Pomeranian " navy uniform with blue stripes on it . Jerry Mouse does more than dance with Gene . He actually talks - a first that he did not repeat for many decades . He also finally puts Tom Cat into his proper place - Tom briefly appears as King Jerry 's butler , trying to cheer him with a platter of cheeses . But the sequence of the cartoon with Kelly took about seven minutes of the movie . Far more of this peculiar film is taken up with Kelly 's story of the lost four day furlough in Hollywood , and how Kelly ends up meeting Katherine Grayson and ( with Frank Sinatra ) stalking Jose Iturbi at the MGM film studio , the Hollywood Bowl , and Iturbi 's own home . Except that the two sailors mean no harm this film could have been quite disturbing . Kelly has saved Sinatra 's life in the Pacific , and is getting a medal as a result . They are both among the crewmen back in California who are getting a four day leave . But the script writers ( to propel what would be a short film - Kelly has plans to spend four days having sex with one " Lola " , an unseen good time girl in Hollywood ) saddle Gene with Frank . It seems Frank is one of those idiots that appear in film after film of the movie factories ( particularly musical comedies ) who are socially underdeveloped and in need of " instruction " about meeting girls ( or guys if the characters are women ) . Frank insists that Gene help " teach him " how to get a girl . Just then a policeman takes them to headquarters to help the cops with a little boy ( Stockwell ) who insists on joining the navy ( and won't give the cops his real name and address ) . When a protesting Kelly is able to get this information out of Stockwell by asking him some straight questions ( which the cops could not ask ) , they insist Kelly take the boy home to his aunt ( Grayson ) . Still protesting , Kelly gets saddled with increasingly complicated problems ( mostly due to Sinatra 's simplistic soul view of things ) . He misses seeing Lola the next day by sleeping late - Sinatra felt he looked so peaceful sleeping he did not wake him up . He keeps getting dragged back to Grayson 's house , as Sinatra feels she is the right woman for himself , but needs Kelly to train him in love making . I suppose my presentation of the plot may annoy fans of ANCHORS AWEIGH , but I find this kind of story irritating . While the singing and dancing and concert music of Kelly , Sinatra , Grayson , and Iturbi are first rate , it is annoying to have to take the idiocies of someone like Sinatra 's character seriously . In the real world Kelly would have beaten the hell out of him at the start for following him at the beginning of the four day furlough - what right has he to insist ( as Sinatra does ) that someone who saves their life should assist him on learning how to date ? That kind of crap always ruins the total affects of a musical for me - unless the musical numbers are so superior as to make me forget this type of nonsense . The stalking of Iturbi is likewise annoying . Kelly tries to get Grayson to like Sinatra when he says Sinatra can get her a meeting with Jose Iturbi to audition her singing ability . For much of the rest of the picture Sinatra and Kelly try to do that , and keep floundering ( at one point - for no really good reason - Grayson herself ruins Kelly 's attempt to get an interview at MGM with Iturbi ) . It is only sheer luck ( that Iturbi feels sorry for an embarrassed Grayson ) that she does give him an audition of her talent . Kelly , by the way , ends up with Grayson . Sinatra 's conscience at not being able to help her see Iturbi makes him ashamed of his bothering her ( but not pulling Kelly into it , oddly enough ) and he meanwhile accidentally stumbles into meeting a waitress ( Pamela Britton ) from his native Brooklyn . And naturally , without any assistance from Kelly , Sinatra and Britton fall in love . Ah , " consistency " ! Thy name is not " screenwriting " necessarily !  
  ANCHORS AWEIGH sees two eager young sailors , Joe Brady ( Gene Kelly ) and Clarence Doolittle / Brooklyn ( Frank Sinatra ) , get a special four-day shore leave . Eager to get to the girls , particularly Joe 's Lola , neither Joe nor Brooklyn figure on the interruption of little Navy-mad Donald ( Dean Stockwell ) and his Aunt Susie ( Kathryn Grayson ) . Unexperienced in the ways of females and courting , Brooklyn quickly enlists Joe to help him win Aunt Susie over . Along the way , however , Joe finds himself falling for the gal he thinks belongs to his best friend . How is Brooklyn going to take this betrayal ? And does Joe end up with Susie , who loves him too ? The first and second times I saw ANCHORS AWEIGH , I also saw it at the same time as I did ON THE TOWN , the Kelly / Sinatra collaboration from 1949 . Both times I felt that ANCHORS AWEIGH was the better film in terms of plotting and structure-all the dances and songs fit the moment in the plot , and they develop the characters and story rather than hamper them . Yet , both times I came away feeling that ON THE TOWN is the better film overall . Having now seen both films a third time , I still stand by that judgement . Somehow ON THE TOWN , as a film and a piece of entertainment , is just lighter , gayer , purely and simply * happier * . The numbers are more outrageous and less integral to the plot , and yet somehow it works better than all the dances and singing in ANCHORS AWEIGH . I 'm not quite sure why this is . The typical argument is that the latter film is over-long : at almost two and a half hours , this is certainly a valid criticism to make . I certainly felt the length the first two times I saw it ! However , it 's also a film that grows on you-the more you see it , the shorter it feels and the more you appreciate the technical mastery involved in its making . And yet , something just doesn't hang together quite right . It feels almost as if the script was pored over , and * every * single moment when Kelly could break into dance or Sinatra into song was noted , and that 's exactly what happened . No opportunity to shoehorn a musical number in was given up .. and that 's probably the film 's biggest weakness . It has 16 numbers ( give or take a few ) , and no matter how big a fan you are of Kelly or Sinatra , this really starts to turn one numb after a while . ( Contrast this , for example , with the ten numbers in ON THE TOWN . ) You might well feel that each song , each dance , can't be taken out of the film without leaving it lacking .. and that 's true . But that 's also because the writers weren't more restrained in adding them in in the first place . All this long preamble doesn't mean there 's nothing good about ANCHORS AWEIGH . The musical * is * splashy with great songs bursting out all over , like the duets between Kelly and Sinatra ( ' We Hate To Leave ' , ' I Begged Her ' and ' If You Knew Susie ' ) , the singing of Sinatra ( ' What Makes The Sunset ' , ' The Charm Of You ' , and the best of all , ' I Fall In Love Too Easily ' ) , and without a doubt the always inventive , always breathtaking dancing of Kelly . It 's also hard to miss with a cast of this calibre . Grayson is sweet and seems to improve on each viewing ( her voice becoming stunning rather than frightening ) ; Jose Iturbi 's role is written sympathetically and he does a great job with it ; even Clarence 's own Brooklyn , Pamela Britton , is cute and charming .. as close as one could get to Betty Garrett without being Garrett herself ! Sinatra is adorable with those blue eyes and curls of his , and plays the innocent boy-man wonderfully ( a role he reprises in ON THE TOWN ) . His singing is , as usual , simply faultless from enunciation through to timing and phrasing . His solo numbers might seem to drag a little , but when you 've got the voice of a century , showcasing it is probably as good a reason as any to slow up the rest of the film ! Gene Kelly 's sheer genius in this film is worthy of its own paragraph . Third in the billing behind Sinatra and Grayson respectively , ANCHORS AWEIGH really is Kelly 's film . His Joe Brady is a believable , real character-he 's tough on the outside , glib and willing to lie when necessary to win a gal , but he 's actually the biggest softy on the inside . Kelly makes this charming rather than cloying , but also gives Joe a real edge that you see in the scene when Joe chases Brooklyn around the room with a genuinely murderous look on his face and his breakfast tray in his hands . And the * dancing * - again , the film suffers from the ' too much of a good thing spoils the effect ' syndrome , as it does with Sinatra 's singing . But once again , if it 's Gene Kelly doing the softshoe , or tapping across the screen in a sailor 's outfit or dressed up as a bandit chief .. might as well err on the side of overdoing it ! All of Kelly 's dances are breathtaking , be it the pared-down simplicity of his tap number with Sinatra to ' I Begged Her ' , his ' Mexican Hat Dance ' with the sweet wide-eyed little girl , or his lavish Spanish-influenced dance ' La Cumparsita ' . Of course , the classic image left in audiences ' minds for all time would be Kelly in his red , white and blue sailor suit , dancing with Jerry Mouse of ' Tom & Jerry ' fame . A well-deserved golden film memory , to be sure-it 's not often that one can say you 're impressed by the special effects in a film made in 1945 , given the saturation of CGI in the contemporary film market . But Gene and Jerry still look great , with Kelly always hitting his spots and looking exactly where he needs to look . It * would * turn out that just about the only people who could really keep up with Gene Kelly would be Kelly himself ( in COVER GIRL ) and a cartoon animation . It 's doubtless that this first daring , inventive Kelly dance with Jerry has reserved a place for ANCHORS AWEIGH in film history and the hearts of classic film buffs . But it 's also notable for being the first of three Kelly / Sinatra film collaborations , and though rather too drawn-out , still a great couple of hours of entertainment . Watch it first , then again and maybe again-it 'll grow on you before you realise it ! 7.5/10  
  The arrival of White Men in Arctic Canada challenges the freedom of a fearless ESKIMO hunter . W . S . Van Dyke , MGM 's peripatetic director , was responsible for this fascinating look at life in the Arctic among the Inuit . His production was on location filming from April 1932 until November 1933 ( although some annoying rear projection effects show that some of the shooting took place back at the Studio ) . While considered a documentary at the time , we would likely term it a ' docudrama ' as it is scripted with an intriguing plot & storyline . The film shows the daily life of the Eskimo , both Winter & Summer , and in fact starts in the warmer time of the year without any snow or ice in sight . The constant striving for food is depicted , and the viewer gets to watch the exciting hunts for walrus , polar bear , whale & caribou . The native language is used throughout , with the use of title cards ; the only English is spoken by the fishermen & Mounties encountered by the Eskimo . In fact , it is the arrival of White Men , both good & bad , and the change they make on Eskimo society , which is a major element in the narrative . This Pre-Code film deals in a refreshingly frank manner with the Eskimo moral code , particularly with their practice of wife-sharing , which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture . In fact , the entire film can be appreciated as a valuable look at a way of life which was rapidly disappearing even in the early 1930 's . None of the cast receives screen credit , which is a shame as there are some notable performances . Foremost among them is that of Ray Wise , playing the leading role of Mala the Eskimo . Wise ( 1906-1952 ) was an Alaskan Native of Inuit ancestry and is absolutely splendid and perfectly believable in what was a very demanding part . As handsome as any Hollywood star , he would continue acting , using the name of Ray Mala , in a sporadic film career , often in tiny unbilled roles . Lovely Japanese-Hawaiian actress Lotus Long plays Mala 's loyal second wife ; the names of the fine actresses playing his other two wives are now obscure . Director Woody Van Dyke steps in front of the cameras as a strict North West Mounted Police inspector . The two decent-hearted Mounties who must deliver Mala to Canadian justice are played by Joe Sawyer & Edgar Dearing , both longtime movie character actors . Danish author Peter Freuchen , upon whose books the film was based , has a short vivid role of an evil wooden-legged sea captain who unwisely rouses Mala 's icy wrath .  
  Julie Waters is outstanding and Adrian Pasdar a revelation in a very warm , very real , and extraordinarily entertaining look at the complications gender dysphoria and transvestism cause in a young executive 's life . At the heart of this movie is the very real truth that you must accept yourself before you can hope for others to accept you .  
  If anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to , with conversation , character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new , better and different , those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing , directing , and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in Italy and England . Other days , other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment , made in 1992 with Alfred Molina , Joan Plowright , Polly Walker , Josie Lawrence , Jim Broadbent , Miranda Richardson , and Michael Kitchens in the major roles . Under the brush stroke direction of Mike Newell , these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter 's eye . Reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century , this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character , and the viewer , too . An artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us .  
  I do find it a bit overrated . Maybe it 's just because I 've never seen a subtitled version ( dubbing stinks ! ) , but I just don't get into it like a lot of other people do . The finale is really great though as Jackie trashes a mall , a scene that plays in my head every time i go shopping !  
  Being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities I think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdb . It 's your basic ' who done it ? ' thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end . I like these kinds of movies and I certainly think this one meets the standard . To me it was worth watching more than once so I 'll give it an 8 on imdb .  
  I understand this film to be a debut feature and as such , it is very impressive . It has the feel and pacing of a " true indie " , yet director Todd Yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision , command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional . The shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward . He , and screenwriter Ivan Solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical " paint by numbers " type scripts . It 's a story that needs Judd Hirsch caliber character talent to have a shot at working . Judd is fantastic as usual ; as are Scott Cohen and the beautiful Susan Floyd . The real surprise though is Elliot Korte who plays Adam Groden . Yellin was able to coax nuance out of the young actor in a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach . Anyway , I found the film refreshing and entertaining .  
  All of those who voted less than 5 are obviously not fans of clean , tongue-in-cheek humor . Keaton is brilliant in this - as in most of his work . This is not a blockbuster , bigger-than-life affair . This is campy , slapstick humor played out by some of Hollywood 's best ( and very versatile ) actors . Piscopo was equally on the mark as the top dog wannabee , once . If you want to see the funniest attempt at not really cussing ever filmed , you gotta see Dimitri do his piece as Morone . I gave it a 7 .  
  Oh , what fun there is here ! Amy Heckerling has a flair for directing comedy ( Fast Times at Ridgemont High , Look Who 's Talking ) but here it looks like she told the actors to go out and have fun . Micheal Keaton breezes through the role of Johnny , easily his best screen performance . Joe Piscopo is great as the appropriately named Danny Vermin , what a shame directors didn't pick up on this . And I have even mentioned Richard Dimitri playing Moronie and the character 's unique vocabulary . I don't think it 's an accident that the bulk of the character 's name is spelled MORON . Good lines are sprinkled throughout the movie , with Peter Boyle , Griffit Dunne . Maurren Stapleton , Merilu Henner given good lines . Even actors with minor roles like Dick Butkus and Alan Hale get in a good lines . recommend it to a friend .  
  A struggling actor finds the best way to break into Hollywood is to start knocking off the competition . But what makes Break a Leg a real gem is the sardonic look into the existence of the struggling ( and not so ) LA actor . It brings us into that world with effortless irony and wit . It 's also got a polished look and very adept direction under Monika Mitchell . Break a Leg is one of those rare independent films that doesn't compromise its production values at any level . The writing is tight , the dialogue first rate . Cassini is an actor 's actor , and the role really shows off his talents . The climactic scene between him and Rene Garcia is an instant classic , and may go down as one of the funniest Hollywood scenes of all time . I saw it at an advanced screening , and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it afterwards .  
  One of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes . And the next day we were in the supermarket at Hollywood Blvd . and La Brea , my father and I , and guess who was coming toward us in the aisle ! Barney Phillips , but no hat on - at least , I don't think he had a hat on . We asked him about his third eye , and he said something like he left it at home , and everybody he met that day had asked him about it . A friendly guy . We used to see all kinds of character actors in LA in those days . BTW , I was a teenager and it took a long time for me to get over the " three hands " on the other alien ! Robyn Frisch O'Neill Hollywood native and resident 1947 to 1963 .  
  I don't see how this show is like the OC at all . First of all , the OC centers around teenagers and their parents trying to get through life . North Shore is about a hotel staff who is trying to run the hotel and have a social life at the same time . Second , The OC takes place in California . North Shore takes place in Hawaii . And why would Fox make a show just like one of its other shows on the same network ? I think this is a great show with good actors for the most part . It has a good storyline and plot . I like the events that happen and how the people take care of them and work them out . The most recent episode was surprising how the story worked out . It wasn't predictable like most stories on most shows . I hope Fox keeps it on the air .  
  A new side to the story of Victoria and Albert is brought to life by director Jean-Marc Valle . Most people 's cursory thoughts of Queen Victoria is that of woman who reigned for several decades and lived her life in mourning . Emily Blunt is more than capable in the title role as she gives audiences a different perspective . She portrays Victoria in her youth , ascension to the throne , and early years . Blunt 's Victoria both fresh and restrained throughout the film . Her strongest scenes are with Albert ( Rupert Friend ) and Lord Melbourne ( Paul Bettany ) . All the actors acquit themselves well including Miranda Richardson in what could of been a throw-away role . Though this is not a story of dramatic arcs and histrionic " acting " moments , the story is still interesting enough to make it worth viewing . There are a few historical liberties that has been taken by the screen writing , the film tries to stay true to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and of the social and royal structure of the time period . The set design and costumes are outstanding . This film will be most appreciated by those drawn to history , period dramas , and of Blunt and the other actors . Heartily recommend . Grade : A  
  I really thought that this movie was superb . Not only is the history correct , but the style is sumptuous and yet intimate . I was a fan of Emily Blunt 's portrayal of Victoria and how she kept her spirit even though she was forced into a virtual exile while in her youth . Blunt depicts the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner that Vicotria became famous ( perhaps infamous ) for . The romantic elements of the movie are so genuine and tender that by the end of the movie you genuinely understand why Vicotria chose to live the rest of her days in mourning of Albert . The technical aspects of the film are worthy of note as well . I appreciated the beautiful score , which moves quite wonderfully along with the dramatic movement of the story . I also considered the cinematography to be outstanding , some scenes leaving me quite breathless because of the lushness and splendor they depict . There have been so few movies this year as beautiful and tender as this film and it rates as one of 2009 's best !  
  One of my favourite films first saw it when I was about 10 , which probably tells you a lot about the type of humour . Although dated the humour definitely has a charm about it . Expect to see the usual Askey & Murdoch banter so popular in its day , with lots of interesting , quirky co-characters . The lady with the parrot , the couple due to get married and are in trouble from ' her ' , and my favourite , the stationmaster , " Nobody knows where it comes from .. nobody knows where it goes .. " Interestingly the ghost train was written by Arnold Ridley of Dads Army fame ( Private Godfrey the medic ) Watch it on a rainy Sunday afternoon after your lunch and smile .  
  A charming little film set in the UK about the reunion of a WWII all girl ( almost ) swing band . A fine cast of oldsters bring lighthearted perspectives on life to this fun tale with an award winning performance by Dench and Laine 's always great " pipes " . Time well spent and a fun watch for all .  
  I first saw Martin 's Day when I was just 10 years old , at home , on The Movie Channel , and still remember the impact it made on my life . It touched me as no other film had touched me , and I remember balling my eyes out . After the first time I saw it , I couldn't find it anywhere else . I would ask around and no one had ever heard of the film ! I guess it was one of those more rare films that not many people knew about , because no one , and I mean no one , knew what I was talking about . I searched and searched throughout the years , checking video stores shelves and scanning cable TV listings , but always came up short . Finally , in 1996 I found out I could special order it , I did , and have probably watched it at least 50 times since-and it still makes me cry , every time . Martin 's Day is about Martin Steckert , a man who is in prison ( but genuinely a good guy ) , who yearns to make it back to the special lake where he grew up as boy . This was a special place , where he lived off nature , spent time with his dog , and was left alone to enjoy life . Soon into the movie , he escapes and starts making his way back to the lake . It isn't long before the cops find him , and Steckert grabs a child as a hostage to convince the police to back off . Soon Steckert and his hostage ( the 2nd Martin ) become best friends , and have many fun adventures together-from robbing a toy truck , to hi-jacking a train , all on the way to this special lake . Throughout the movie , Steckert has great flashbacks of him at the lake as a boy . I won't ruin the ending for you , but I will tell you , this movie is a must see . It is the BEST movie I have EVER seen in my life ! I am , without a doubt , the biggest fan of this movie EVER ! I managed to find the song that the two Martin 's are singing throughout the movie ( " I 'm going back , to where I come from .. ) . I 'm even planning a trip to Canada to see the lake and cottage where Martin 's Day was filmed . Crazy , I know-but that movie just means so much to me .  
  Let me first state that while I have viewed every episode of StarTrek at least twice , I do not consider myself a Trekker or Trekkie . Those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears . I gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors . The acting was better than average , but the plot held no surprises . They tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation . Now as to the historical errors , if you call them that , the first Capitan to pilot the Enterprise was Commander April , then Capt . Pike , Jim Kirk , etc .. According to a statement made by both Riker and Kirk we dicovered the Klingons and educated them and gave them the technology ( that 's the reason a prime directive was created ) but like I said these are no reason to discredit this fine series . I hope the plots will get deeper , and then special effects can take a backseat .  
  Reviewed at the Sept 12 , 2006 2nd screening at the Paramount 1 theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival . The film had World Premiered the day before at the Elgin Theatre VISA Screening Room . The basic plot involves Morgan Freeman playing a one time popular actor who is on the downward slope of his career and who is taking on roles that may be beneath him , but which he still does with a positive attitude knowing that he needs to pay the rent etc . The downward slope is indicated by his being a long time between roles with previous flicks in bargain DVD bins and his being chauffeured by a not too sure of himself production assistant who drops Freeman off at a local community market where he is going to do research for a role as supermarket manager . He soon discovers the real-life market is run by a iron-willed " 10 Items or Less " checkout line clerk played by Paz Vega . When Freeman 's ride never returns and Vega needs help in prepping for an interview the circumstances cause them to join forces in a ride across town to get Freeman back home and to get Vega a job that 'll get her on a more upwardly mobile career path . While the film was enjoyable , it felt like it was still a sketch or a work in progress . There were two extended musical sequences ( One with Vega & Freeman teaching each other children 's songs in the car , one that literally plays like a Paul Simon music video ) that felt like padding to bring up the time and even then the film was only about 80 minutes long . It 's a good thing Morgan Freeman is as well liked as he is because without him this would have been too little . Sure it was funny in parts and Paz Vega is a delight as well , but there was just not enough here to say it was a complete film . They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car to ask for directions and Paz Vega said she never does that . Who ever heard of a guy wanting to ask for directions and the woman saying no ! ? In the real world it 's the exact opposite . Make sure you stay for the outtakes in the credits . The bit with a Target Store saleslady teaching Morgan Freeman how to hustle sales is just hilarious ! An early bit where Freeman 's chauffeur insists it is Freeman 's voice on a " Books on Tape " reading was also pretty funny . The director / writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there for a brief Q & A after the screening . Silberling answered one question saying that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and that once Freeman took the role he actually changed very little of what was there . Quite a compliment for both Silberling 's writing and also about how Freeman can just slip into a role and make it feel entirely like he was born to play it .  
  Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are the mismatched pair who get in the car and go about doing errands according to the need of one or the other . Morgan Freeman is superbly human , relating with one and all , while Paz Vega is the edgy cashier behind the " 10 Items or Less " check out line , intimidating customers and bored out of her mind . Together they explore , discover , and learn from each other . To do that of course they must be vulnerable , interested in change , and have a sense of humour , all of which they both have . I wish this film was realistic , I wish this type of story happened more often , I wish we didn't have to go to the movies to realize that we can indeed connect with each other even if we come from vastly different backgrounds . The film 's message is based in the open heart , and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world where we meet each other from there - a world where peace could be a possibility .  
  It 's wonderful to see that Shane Meadows is already exerting international influence - LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT shares many themes with A ROOM FOR ROMEO BRASS : the vague class identity above working but well below middle , the unhinged father , the abandoned urban milieu , the sense of adult failure , the barely concealed fascism underpinning modern urban life . But if Meadows is an expert formalist , Mariage trades in images , and his coolly composed , exquisitely Surreal , monochrome frames , serve to distance the grimy and rather bleak subject matter , which , Meadows-like , veers from high farce to tragedy within seconds . There are longueurs and cliches , but Poelvoorde is compellingly mad , an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions , whose attempts to realise them are hatstand dangerous ; while individual set-pieces - the popcorn / pidgeon explosions ; the best marriage sequence since THE DEAD AND THE DEADLY - manage to snatch epiphany from despair .  
  This was a delightful presentation . Hemo ( blood ) as a Greek god was so well played by the animation with vanity , arrogance , snobbish superiority and innocent wonder . The quote ( or scene ) I recall vividly is when Hemo tires of " all this plumbing .. you haven't learned my secrets at all " and threatens to storm out , the Scientist answers him in a single word " Thalassa " - salt water which horrifies the Fiction Writer but mollifies Hemo and segues so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood . Such a splendid blend of entertainment and information make this a classic as fresh and engrossing today as the day it was released . Stimulating the interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching kids to love learning .  
  This was Barbra Streisand 's first television special and is " must see " viewing for any Streisand fan . Even non-Streisand fans will enjoy this highly energetic and entertaining piece of entertainment history . Performers like this only come our way once in a lifetime . Brilliant !  
  This one stood out for it 's originality . I 'm seriously tired of seeing Hindi movies that are a hotch-potch of a whole bunch of Hollywood and Brit movies . Some flaws were inevitable , nonetheless , this movie is a must-see . Surya 's portrayal of the clean-cut , conscientious cop ( as opposed to the pot-bellied , money-hungry ones that we normally see ) was awesome . He 's come a long way from his work in Nerukku Ner . I liked the movie so much that I had to own it . I 'm not usually into the mindless violence type of movies , somehow I actually felt for each character and therefore can't really bring myself to call it ' mindless ' violence . I do not appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most Hindi and Tamil movies . I absolutely loved this movie for it 's lack of the same . ACP Anbuselvan 's reaction to loosing his wife , is not overdone , is heart-wrenching and makes me want to bawl my eyes out . There are certain times when I 'm watching a movie when I want to hit the FF button . Plenty of times I 've wanted to do that at a cinema hall . Never wanted to do so when watching this movie . I 'm really hoping that Ghajini releases soon .  
  When ever a film is produced or directed by Mel Ferrer , you can bet your life any of his pictures will be seen for generation after generation . Just having Claudette Colbert , ( Ellen R . Ewing ) , " The Egg & I " , ' 47 appearing and starring in the film will make it even more of a great Classic Film . In this film , Ellen Ewing gets married and then she encounters all kinds of mental problems and even murder . The mystery gets very much involved and Robert Ryan , ( David McLean ) , " Battle of the Bulge " , ' 65 , comes to the aid of Ellen and sometimes you even wonder about David being on the up and up . As you view this picture you just about find yourself beginning to understand who is the real nutty person and all of a sudden , you begin to change your mind how the film will end . Great acting by Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan who played an entirely different role than he usually portrays on the screen . I forgot to mention that Mel Ferrer , was married to a great film star , Audrey Hepburn . Great Classic film , with great Classic Actors !  
  How can anyone argue the fact that Urban Cowboy was , and still is , the best document of Texas life for the time period . Consider the following : men beat their wives , get drunk at bars nightly , get married to settle a fight , commit adultery , and compete on mechanical bulls . Try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly . They dont make them anymore . It seems current films are always about people with lots of money , they live in huge homes , drive expensive cars and don't work . This movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer for pete 's sake ! Anyway , I watch it at least once a week . No kidding . I have dissected this movie from end to end . feel free to email me to learn more about my reason for calling it a documentary . Consider the following scenes : Bud sees Sissy - they are split up - he amicably honks and waves , she flips him the bird - he returns half the peace sign honking his horn to add impact then tears off . Buds mom calls him approx . 18 hours after he gets into town , on a Sunday , to see if he has a job yet - all he has accomplished is getting drunk and laid ( x2 ) , with help from his uncle and aunt who cover for him . " You all live like pigs " Think about why this scene is needed . Think about it . Was it necessary ? Could we not figure it out without showing the filthy sink ? God I love that ! Sissy allows Wes to help her ride the bull . Only a few days ( or possibly the next day ) after Wes just kicked the crap out of her husband . Steve asks - Hey Sissy , remember Wes ? Oh yeah , didnt you beat my husband up the other night , so let 's get this lesson goin ' , to make no mention of the fact that she seeks solace in him later during one Bud and Sissy 's many fights , which by the way all take place in public - in Gilley 's ! The Wedding reception picture taking session ( oh the humanity ! ) could they at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way . " My legs are sweatin ' momma " In conclusion , you don't put scenes like this in a movie to try and show insight into human psychology . It is a documentary of real life . I only wish there was a director 's cut ..  
  This is my FAVORITE ALL time movie . It used to be my Friday night movie with a pizza and bottle of wine when I was single . I first saw this movie with my aunt Brend and sister Chasity . I was in the 2nd grade . I fell in LOVE with Travolta and Sissy was my new best friend . I 've read a lot of comments about why Bud left Sissy & how Sissy has to " learn to act " married . But let 's go back and look at this for a second : SPOILER - My interpretation of the movie now , not when I was eight is this about Bud & Sissy 's relationship takes a turn for the worst because she makes a fool of him at Gilley 's riding the bull . They get in a huge fight . Bud tries to make Sissy jealous by asking Pam to dance . Sissy then thinks two wrongs will make a right and Wes asks her if " she needs any help " . They 're all on the dance floor acting like fools when Bud asks Pam , " when are you going to take me home and rape me ? " Pam answers : " When ever you 're ready Cowboy " . Bud then goes home with Pam to her condo in downtown Houston . Which Daddy has bought for her with his oil money and " all that that implies " . Bud is the one who cheats on Sissy . Sissy is waiting for Bud when he returns home the next day . Sissy is the ONE who leaves Bud . Then , it 's up to Bud to prove to Sissy that he is a real " cowboy " and win her back . Anyways , that 's my interpretation . Everyone has their I 'm sure ! I love this movie . And believe it or not , I got myself a REAL cowboy ! I love him too ! : )  
  I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out . As a result I don't remember anything about the movie . But I do remember the sensation it caused from Gilley 's and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lee 's hit song " Lookin ' for Love " which still brings back memories of childhood whenever I hear it . However , a few years ago I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is , I was blown away . Few movies have hit me harder . This movie is as raw and real as you can get . From Uncle Bob 's ranch house , the chemical plant in Texas City , Gilley 's dance hall , and Bud and Sissy . And maybe for that reason it doesn't have a wider appeal . But no matter how you feel about country music ( I for one can't stand it despite my Houston roots ) Urban Cowboy is a unique slice of American pie . For that reason I love it !  
  THis movie shows us once again , how genius the Japanese directors are and were . This movie could be seen as a sort of a " Silent - Movie Tetsuo " . Well Eisenstein .. : )  
  With rapid intercutting of scenes of insane people in an asylum , and montage / superimposition of images , and vague , interwoven narratives , this is a very hard movie to follow . Apparently a man ( Masue Inoue ) takes a job as a porter or janitor in an asylum so he can be near his imprisoned wife , and maybe to rescue her . But she 's clearly mad , huddled on the floor , with a vacant expression much of the time and fear , misery , and confusion written on her face the rest of the time . The film-maker switches to her point of view sometimes , and we see vague images of her at the side of a pond drowning a baby , or clutching at a drowned child . She 's tormented by something . When the point of view shifts to her or other mad folks , the filmmaker uses distorting lenses and such things , showing us what mad people see and then how they react . And the place is swarming with mad folks , laughing , hiding , and in one case dancing frenetically night and day . At one point the man tries to take his wife outside , but the night outside the door terrifies her and she runs back to her cell . Gradually the man slips into a nightmare in which he 's interrupted in another attempt to steal her away , and he kills the doctor and many attendants , and all the while the mad folk laugh and applaud . When he wakes he is relieved , and mops the floor . Some fascinating shots of Japanes life , streets , buildings in the 1920s .  
  If I could go back , even as an adult and relive the days of my Summer 's spent at camp .. I would be there so fast . The Camps I went to weren't even this great . They were in Texas where the mosquitoes actually carry people off but we had horses and fishing . The movie cinematography was astounding , the characters funny and believable especially Perkins , Pollack and Arkin . Sam Raimi 's character and sub-antics were priceless . So who ever thought this movie was lame .. I have deep pity for because they can't suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine camp life again as an adult or they never went as kids . The whole point was that these people had an opportunity to regress and become juvenile again and so they did at every opportunity . I wish I could . It was funny , intelligent , beautifully scripted , brilliantly cast and the artistry takes me back so I want to watch it over and over just for the scenery even . Sorta like Dances with Wolves and LadyHawk .. good movies but the wilderness becomes a character as much as the actors . Rent it , see it , buy it and watch it over and over and over .. never gets old . ; 0 )  
  One is tempted to define the genre of Gert de Graaff 's movie as ` event of the thought ' following the example of Merab Mamardashvili . The nominal storyline is a certain Bart Klever 's torturous quest for that ephemeral substance which constitutes the essence of personality . The script for his new movie is taking shape simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination . This film-monologue originated as a response to Fellini 's ` 8 ½ ' and cost Gert de Graaff 13 years of work . Excitedly playing with real and fictional characters as well as with the audience , it reveals the whimsical interconnection of the real and imaginary , the paradoxical co-existence in two different galaxies : that of Guttenberg and that of MacLhuen . For some time we are apt to side with the script writer , who believes that the cause of all misfortune is the damned stereotypes of mass mentality ( ` man ' , ` catholic ' , ` window washer ' ) . And together with him we fall into a trap when the author-creator is finally faced with the insoluble dilemma : how can one eliminate from the future movie . Bart Klever ? Just five minutes before the finale thanks to the common petty reproaches of the wife of the creator , who is deeply immersed in work , we realize that together with the main character we have again been ` framed ' . Really , what is the price of the art for the sake of which it is acceptable to renounce one 's own name and the day-to-day care for the young daughter ? So who is he , this Bart Klever ? Is he a brilliant prophet or someone possessed like Frenhoffer from Balzac 's masterpiece ( just like the latter the script writer in the end erases from the computer memory everything has written ) ? Gert de Graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves .  
  Okay , like many other such films , spawned out of a SNL skit . But Tim Meadows does a fairly fantastic job of making a 3 minute one-dimensional character into a moderately viable comedic movie character . He drops amusingly consistently-threated one-liners with fair frequency , Billy Dee Williams is in it though his Lando days are long gone , and the entire thing is shot pretty well . True , it 's not great art , but if you went into Wayne 's World looking for the Gone With The Wind , you did something wrong . Enjoyable for what it is ..  
  I don't know .. Maybe it 's just because it 's an impressive tribute to some Muslim religious action ( hajj ) but I just felt the movie is so underrated . I just can't believe that the movie has just been voted by only 223 people so far given that the movie was produced in 2004 and it has won many awards since then . About the movie .. it 's one of those well-acted sweet movies . Reda , a French teenager due to sit for Baccalauréat , is asked by his devout elderly father to take him to Mecca . Strange as it may seem ( if one doesn't know much about Islam ) the father wants his son to drive them from their home in France to Saudia Arabia on a once in a lifetime religious pilgrimage . The generation gap between the father and the son is based on simple enough terms ( ' you may know how to read and write , but you know nothing about life , ' the unnamed father to his son ) but some sort of bromidic generation gap literature is avoided . Bot of them are affectionate in their frustrations . The father never speaks in French though Reda understands Arabic but can only seem to answer in French . Though they encounter many people on the road : " There 's the scary old woman they pick up in the Bosnian border on the way to Belgrade , and the talkative Mustafa ( Jacky Nercessian ) , who helps them out at the border of Turkey , the reticent and shy women wearing burqas on the way to Damascus " the focus is always on the mismatched father and son . There is not much of a conversation in the movie which makes it enjoyable to your eyes . You see magnificent views in every city they go . The director shows you even the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia even though the movie is not relatively long . Generally I don't like movies which don't have enough dialogs and which take their power from camera subtleties but this one was really great . Despite some unanswered details ( like Reda 's unseen French girlfriend ) the movie appeals to senses . Great work of art and remember this movie is Ismaël Ferroukhi 's debut .  
  I thought this was an utterly charming film . The story seems to be a thinly veiled autobiography of John Waters : Pecker 's greatest gift is his ability to find beauty in unexpected places . Edward Furlong does well in the lead , but the best performances are by his grandmother , Mink Stole ( a hilarious cameo ) and , of all people , Patty Hearst . I think the reviewers are way off base on this one . They seem to be taking Pecker 's worst valuation of his work as gospel , when I think the film pretty clearly states that he is indeed a promising artist .  
  John Waters most accessible film to date is one of his better ones , considering it cut down on all of the campiness and outright vulgarity which seem to litter most of his previous work . Sure , the nudity and the sexual references are still there , at least it is presented in a fashion that cannot be deemed too foul or disgusting . Due to some great casting choices , this film really brought out the silliness associated with modern art and the subjective nature of your modern artist . Funny and somewhat lighthearted ( if that is possible for Waters ) , this is one of those films I would watch on a rainy day .  
  This is a very good Spanish movie but I am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the Spanish Civil War was all about or when it was fought . Being a history teacher , I had a big advantage but could easily see how the film could be confusing until you piece together all the pieces . I doubt if this would be a big concern in Spain where this film was made , but for other audiences they may be a bit confused until later in the film . The movie begins with 12 year-old Carol and her mother returning to her mother 's home town . Years have passed and you gather that they are coming to Spain from New York City . Despite the strangeness , Carol speaks reasonably good Spanish and much of the film is about how she adapts . As for why her and her mother are alone , I 'll spill it now for those who don't pick up on the fact that Carol 's father is fighting in the war on the side of the Republicans ( who eventually lost in this very bloody conflict ) . The movie gets exceptional marks for its lovely camera work and music . The rather slow and rambling pace isn't bad provided you are someone who can accept films this way . I have seen several other Spanish films about this war and this compares pretty well to them-not better or worse-just a decent slice of life film about those who are left behind as well as a nice coming of age flick . PS-If you don't know which side is which , the Republicans were mostly Socialists and they were backed by the Soviet Union and Mexico as well as volunteers from many countries ( including the USA ) . The Nationalists were led by Franco and were aided by Portugal and the Fascist states of Germany and Italy .  
  I have seen The Running Man several times as I am a Stephen King fan and have all his movies but now it is even better because up until 2 days ago I didn't know about this website and I didn't realize that the Paul Michael Glaser that was involved with this movie was the same Paul Michael Glaser that I grow up watching on Starsky and Hutch television show . For me this is a pleasant surprise because I can't tell you how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch got hurt . The episode where Starsky ( Kill Starsky ) almost died I cried so hard My dad had to turn away from the show . What to you expect of a kid at age 12 . Now , I intentionally look for films and programs involving Paul or David Soul and anything that Stephen King has his hands on I 'm so there ! Just got to say Happy birthday Paul !  
  This is an Arnold movie . Now that you know that , I 've saved a lot of you the time it would have taken to read this review . If you don't like Arnold , then you wont like this movie . If the case is the other , then you will very probably like it . It 's as simple as that . Now , if you 're still reading this I expect you like Arnold . Good for you ! He is quite good isn't he . The Running Man is a very typical Arnold feature . It 's got the usual retro-future we know so well from 80 's B-Sci Fi , it 's got a bunch of terrible one-liners , lots of violence and explosions , and a good-looking heroine and a happy ending . In this case , the evil opponent is the all-controlling 1984ish government , which uses television as an effective crowd-control with gladiator-type game shows . Arnold , of course , ends up in one of these shows and turns it all up-side-down , with a little help from his two confederates and the good-looking Amber . It 's not a big budget movie , but it still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future , with some nice matte paintings and sets to help it . It 's hopelessly 80 's , but I find that charming . Acting is varying , Arnold doing his usual grunt and shout thing , with a helping of stone-faced one-liners . Heroine Amber is , to put it lightly , a bit stereotypical , and the subtly named Damen Killian is a typical evil TV man . In spite of all it 's flaws , the movie shows its message very clearly ; television is an opiate of the masses , a good way to control people . It also features some at the time futuristic digital video editing , allowing the bad guys to change faces in a video to fool their audience . This does not seem futuristic at all today , which is a bit alarming . If you 've seen Arnold movies before then you know when to watch this one . Enjoy .  
  Running Man isn't a great movie , in fact it 's kinda silly . But it delivers what you want in an Arnie movie and that is action and entertainment . I don't see how anyone couldn't enjoy this picture , it 's so silly and over the top , that it almost makes fun of itself . By the way , this is probably one of the most quotable Arnie movies out there .  
  Home Room really surprised me . In comparison to other movies that were written regarding Columbine high school this one is the best . Home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town . The movie focus ' on two opposite characters . , Alecia ( Busy Phillips ) and Deanna ( Erika Christensen ) . Alecia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting . She seems to show no emotion about it . Deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim . Alecia is forced to visit Deanna at the hospital in order to graduate . Meanwhile the police are investigating Alecia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen . Alecia and Deanna are very different and do not get along at first . Eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends . ( very much in the style of the breakfast club ) . Home Room Beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting . I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone .  
  Obviously a film that has had great influence not only on the buddy genre but action genre as well . George Lucas had to be a fan of this flick as so much of his Star Wars series seems to a homage to Gunga Din . The characters that Grant , McLaglen , and Fairbanks play are just precursors of Han Solo , Luke Skywalker , and Chewbacca . Even Sam Jaffe 's Gunga Din morphed into C-3PO and R2-D2 and like him or not : Jar Jar Binks . Today this film is viewed as non PC but there is a speech by Eduardo Ciannelli as Guru the leader of the Indian opposition to the British raj that could can be echoed in the sentiments of many today . To a young boy this was a great film . Three strong male leads and only a hint of romance . There was a time when young boys deemed kissing the girl in Saturday matinee film was just mush . Not like today when the more skin is greeted with delight . Too late to lament lost innocence . Hopefully this film will not be forgotten and a few who are channel surfing will stop at TCM and catch a film with action , adventure , and a cast of thousands instead of CGI actors .  
  An original uncensored print of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress , and has been shown in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005 . According to current reviews that I 've found online , the original has all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos intact ; they were later either removed or completely re-shot by the studio prior to initial release , in order to pass the New York state censors . I have also read that a DVD is " expected in 2006 " and one can only hope ! If we 're really luckily , it will include comparisons between the 2 versions . Note that the released censored version was originally available on Laserdisc , which I have seen . Stanwyck rules !  
  I don't know if I 'm just weird , but I thoroughly enjoyed this film . Return to Cabin by the Lake is of course the sequel to another one of my favorite films Cabin by the Lake . In fact , I think that I enjoyed this movie even more than the first one . I also thought that the cast in this movie was great , Judd Nelson is always the best ! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole . I liked the fact that this second movie focused on the filming of Stanley 's screenplay Cabin by the Lake - it wasn't a completely redundant film of Stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them . - If you 're looking for some deep meaning , then this film is probably not the one for you . However , if you 're looking for a fun way to spend two hours , then go ahead and watch it . I 've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film . : )  
  Whether this movie is propaganda or not ( I firmly believe it is not ) , it really shows the power of Media . The importance of this documentary is not to show how good of a man Chavez is . It is really to demonstrate the way the Bolivarians saw how it happened , the Chavez way of seeing it . Although it may seem wrong and bias to support a film , I think the point of view shown in the movie is utterly legitimate . The Venezuelian people via the private media corporation of Venezuela only saw a one side perspective of the coup , the Neo-Liberal side . This movie shows us the way the Bolivarians saw it . Call it propaganda , I say it 's a judgment call on your part .  
  Watching " The Fox and the Child " was an intoxicating experience . The lush visuals , integrity of point of view , and utter beauty of the setting and characters left me in a swoon of pleasure . The plot is uncomplicated . Deceptively simple . Within the container of that simplicity a world unfolds that draws you in and leaves you breathless . I laughed . I wept . I learned . This is a movie you can trust yourself to - give yourself over to . Dare I say it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart . It reaches to the heart of the viewer-of any age-and reveals the world through new eyes , as if seen from the heart . Adi Da Samraj once said that true Art draws the viewer beyond point of view into ecstatic participation in Reality . I feel I have been privileged to watch-no , to participate in-this film , a work of true Art .  
  This was stupid funny movie .. Cheech and Chong are the dopiest wasted guys ever .. i rate this film a 7 .. but if you like this one then go see Jay and Silentbob ! There funnier and crazier . Now Cheech is a sellout working on kids movies .. wheres chong ?  
  This movie was hysterical . I haven't laughed this hard in a long time . I mean , it 's not " Good Will Hunting , " but was it supposed to be ? I actually went into the advanced screening expecting a lot less and was pleasantly surprised . The comedy hits hard and is fairly constant . Amanda Peet is hot and awesome . The entire audience that I screened it with seemed to be enjoying the film as much as I did .  
  ( No need to recap the plot , since others have done so already . ) It 's understandable that many viewers find fault with the film , raised as we are with the slam-bang sensurround of today 's cineplex experience . Against that background , a movie like Ecstasy appears to have wandered in from another planet . I think there are several worthwhile reasons why . Most importantly , the film unfolds poetically , as the camera pans slowly over surrounding hills , trees , clouds , etc . , providing a serene and lyrical sense of a natural world that integrates the man and woman into its fold . Together these reveal a style and dimension almost totally missing from today 's technology-driven cinema , where rapid-fire editing works to divert audience attention and not to concentrate it . Additionally , the story is conveyed by eye and not by ear , with almost no dialogue to explain what 's happening . This amounts to another extreme departure from today 's very literal fare , where visuals only seem to count when they excite the audience . But perhaps most unsettling - the movie is sometimes eerily quiet , not in the sense that silent films are quiet since we expect them to be . But in the sense that the characters seldom speak when we expect them to . Thus , the burden of the story is shared between the film-maker and the viewer . The former must choose his visuals artfully so as to convey the narrative , while the latter must think about those visuals , since they 're not going to be explained . None of this is intended to belittle today 's film-making . It 's simply to point out that a movie like Machaty 's comes out of a very different aesthetic from the one we have today . I don't claim either to be any better or worse . However , I do claim that Ecstasy represents a perspective sorely missing from today 's movie-going experience , where such ' contemplative values are routinely dismissed as slow and boring . The film itself is no masterpiece , though at times it reaches artistic heights , as in the beautifully composed beer-garden scene with its final crane shot rising to reveal the exquisite tableau below . The slow pans of the countryside with its pantheistic celebration of life , nature , and regeneration are also wonderfully expressed . These are the kind of scenes that don't overwhelm you , but instead - given half-a chance - accumulate quietly into an experience as memorable in its own way as the spine-tingling variety of a " Jaws " . On the other hand , the film is sometimes heavy-handed , as when Machaty piles on the imagery , particularly in the final , ode-to-labor sequence . It 's hard to know what to make of this rather disruptive presence . Perhaps the symbolism has to do with the heroic dimension that hard work holds for the love-lorn hero and people in general - a theme then being promoted by the influential Soviet cinema . Still , its presence here is rather tediously over-done . Anyhow , I 've got to admit that I tuned in initially to see the gorgeous Hedy LaMarr in the buff . But now I have to admit that in the process I also got a lot more than just a peek-a-boo romp in the woods .  
  This is a very difficult movie , and it 's almost impossible to get a handle on what 's going on . At first it seems to be a rather pedestrian movie about a guy ( Trelkovsky ) who needs an apartment and rather crassly invites himself into one when the current tenant ( a woman ) commits suicide . Then the twists and turns start . Are the neighbors trying to kill him ? And why are the dead tenant 's clothes turning up in the apartment ? One wonders , finally , if Trelkovksy _ is _ the prior tenant . SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER One of the tricks Polanski pulls on us is to lie to us . We assume when we see things from the point of view of a character that we see things as the character does and that there may be distortions of reality . We assume when the camera is showing us things from its omniscient point of view that we see actuality - but Polanski has the camera lie to us .  
  Sure , he became rapidly uneven after this film , but from " Knife In the Water " up till " The Tenant " , Roman Polanski could always be counted on to deliver something fascinating and unique . Despite many running themes ( alienation , paranoia ) , no two of his films are really alike . The story of this is somewhat similar to his own " Repulsion " from ten years earlier , but the tone is completely different . " The Tenant " manages to balance darker than dark absurdity ( I 'm a bit hesitant on calling it humor , even though the protagonists bizarre behavior and dialog was occasionally funny ) with some truly suspenseful paranoia . Polanski was always a master at building unease , and moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy . The overall weirdness of the film is also a plus . In addition to Polanski 's exquisite as usual direction , the rest of the cast and crew offer great contributions . Polanski the actor is often overshadowed by Polanski the director , but his performance here truly captures his characters awkwardness and sense of being an outcast . The themes of social discrimination make this film more than just strangeness for the sake of being strange . The rest of the cast offers strong performances also , especially Isabelle Adjani 's sympathetic turn , and Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters ' appropriately annoying ones . " The Tenant " is often underrated because of how ready people are to heap praise on both " Repulsion " and " Rosemary 's Baby " , but its just as brilliant as either of those classics . ( 9/10 )  
  This is one creepy movie . Creepier than anything David Lynch , and that shows what a great director Polanski is since this is not his usual type of work , and it is BRILLIANT . It all starts of with Trelkovski moves into a tenement block in Paris . He soon learns that the previous tenant , a young woman , committed suicide and he believes the rest of the people living there drove her to it . He also believes that they are trying to do the same to him . What results is a amazing and frightening look at paranoia . The whole production has classical horror written all over it : from the imagery to the music the viewer can feel poor Trelkovski 's terror building up . Are they all out to kill him ? Or maybe just drive him mad ? Is there a difference ? Find out for yourself . 10/10  
  I love the series ! Many of the stereotypes portraying Southerrners as hicks are very apparent , but such people do exist all too frequently . The portrayal of Southern government rings all too true as well , but the sympathetic characters reminds one of the many good things about the South as well . Some things never change , and we see the " good old boys " every day ! There is a Lucas Buck in every Southern town who has only to make a phone call to make things happen , and the storybook " po ' white trash " are all too familiar . Aside from the supernatural elements , everything else could very well happen in the modern South ! I somehow think Trinity , SC must have been in Barnwell County !  
  Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have least heard of - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it . But it is still great - a fiery Duke of Wellington and a fat foolish Dr Johnson ( writer of the first dictionary in England ) make this series one to be reckoned with . There are still more hilarious one-liners to be delivered in this series , and it brings out the humour in a lesser-known era - in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes . Blackadder 's third outing is not the most famous and well-known of the lot , but Rowan Atkinson 's role as a butler to a stupid prince is a funny and effectively done one , and Hugh Laurie is at his best in this series . Very good ! 9/10  
  * Wonderland SPOILERS * July 1st , 1981 : five people , Ron Launius ( Josh Lucas ) , Susan Launius ( Christina Applegate ) , Billy Deverell ( Tim Blake Nelson ) , Barbara Richardson ( Natasha Gregson Wagner ) and Joy Miller ( Janeane Garofalo ) are attacked while they 're asleep and brutally hit on the head with steel pipes in their home at 8763 Wonderland Avenue , Laurel Canyon , LA . Only Susan survives . Main Suspect : John Holmes ( Val Kilmer ) , former king of porn , owner of a 30 cm long dick , and now a hopeless addict . Two investigators , Luis ( Frankie G . ) and Sam Nico ( Ted Levine ) , are investigating on the case and try to crack it with the help of a witness that claims to know that John at the very least took part in the murders , David Lind ( Dylan McDermott ) , Barbara 's boyfriend , and trying to get a witness report out of Dawn Schiller ( Kate Bosworth ) , Holmes ' 19-year-old girlfriend and from Susan , who sadly doesn't remember anything more than shadows about the night her husband 's head was bashed in and hers almost suffered the same fate , and the name of Eddie Nash ( Eric Bogosian ) , a major drug kingpin ( who is always around ladies such as Barbie ( Paris Hilton ) ) , comes into light as a suspect planner of the Wonderland massacre . But what did happen that night ? And could Sharon ( Lisa Kudrow ) , John 's wife , know something about it ? ' Wonderland ' is a taught , intense thriller , a desperate love story and a story of a man 's sad decline all in one ; there is a clever use of the ' Rashomon ' technique ( we see the events of that fateful day and night from the eyes of David , John , Dawn , Susan ( albeit very briefly ) and Sharon ) , a nice direction and a great script , but is mostly compelling for the performances , especially Kilmer 's , who takes central stage with his hopeless , tormented , sometimes childish Holmes , Lucas ' , whose Launius is strangely alluring , Kudrow 's strong Sharon and Bosworth 's innocent Dawn . Wonderland : 9/10 .  
  Karen ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) , an exchange student in Japan who is just beginning to do some social work , is sent to aid an elderly semi-catatonic woman , Emma ( Grace Zabriskie ) , after her previous caretaker , Yoko ( Yoko Maki ) , disappears . Karen soon learns that something is not right in Emma 's home , and she attempts to " see how deep the rabbit hole goes " . Maybe it 's a delayed influence from the success of M . Night Shyamalan 's films , but slower-paced , understated horror films are a recent trend . In some cases , such as Hide and Seek ( 2005 ) , the approach works remarkably well , and in others , such as White Noise ( 2005 ) , the pacing tends to kill the film . I didn't like The Grudge quite as much as Hide and Seek , but this is still a very good film-it earns a 9 out of 10 from me . The Grudge has a couple significant differences from other recent examples of that trend , however . One , it is well known that this is a remake based on the Japanese film series that began with Ju-On ( 2000 ) ( in particular , it 's extremely close to the first half of Ju-On : The Grudge , aka Ju-On 3 , from 2003 ) . Two , as with many Japanese horror films , the slower pacing here isn't so much in the realm of realist drama as with surrealism . As is also the case with a large percentage of European horror , The Grudge should be looked at more as a filmed nightmare . Director Takashi Shimizu , also the director of the five Japanese entries in the Ju-On series to date ( the fifth is currently in production ) , and writer Stephen Susco have largely dispensed with linearity and are not overly concerned with logic or plot holes when it comes to the horror behind the story . The idea instead is to present a dreamlike sequence of scenes , with dream logic , where the focus is atmosphere , creepiness , the uncanny , and for many viewers-scares . How well the film works for you will largely depend on how well you can adapt yourself to , or are used to , this different approach to film-making ( although admittedly , some of the seeming gaps are filled in by previous entries in the Ju-On series ) . Traditionally , American audiences consider as flaws leaving plot threads hanging and abandoning " rules " for the " monster " . A more poetic , metaphorical , surreal approach to film isn't yet accepted by the mainstream in the U.S. However , even if you 're not used to it , it 's worth trying to suspend your normal preconceptions about films and give The Grudge a shot . This is a well written , well directed , well acted film , filled with unusual properties , such as the story interweaving a large number of " main characters " ( which is done better here than the more episodic Ju-On 3 ) , good cinematography , subtle production design touches ( check out Gellar 's clothes , which match the color and texture of the exterior of Emma 's house , when Gellar first approaches ) , and beautifully effective horror material . Even though it is more slowly paced that your average horror film of the past , the pacing usually enhances the eeriness , and there is no shortage of bizarre events to keep horror fans entertained . The supernatural premise of the film is absorbing , and based on interviews on the DVD with Shimizu , have prodded me to pay more attention to Japanese beliefs and folklore . Although the most interesting subtexts would probably arise with a more intimate knowledge of Japanese culture , it 's interesting to ponder why so many Japanese horror films feature scary children and adults who look like scary children . I subtracted one point for the film slightly veering into clichéd mystery / thriller territory with a " here 's what really happened " flashback , but even that was fairly well done , and otherwise , this would have been a 10 out of 10 . Now that I 've said all of the above , let me finish with a mini-rant : It 's not that I 'm anti-remake , but it is ridiculous that U.S. distributors and studios feel that we need remakes of foreign films to make them appropriate for consumption . The original versions of these films should just be playing in U.S. theaters in wide release . There is no need to present an almost identical film but just substituting white American actors for non-white or foreign actors . Yes , The Grudge is a fine film , but ultimately , I 'd rather see something original using this talent , and be treated to the latest foreign horror films-not just Japanese , but also Indian , Spanish , Chinese , etc . - at my multiplex . In the hope that someone with some pull at the studios reads this , it is also more cost-effective to do this , as ( 1 ) you can completely avoid production costs , and simply make domestic distribution deals from which you receive profit , and ( 2 ) you can make money off of fans like myself who otherwise pick up the foreign film DVDs in foreign manufactured or even bootleg versions .  
  Academy Award winner Robert Redford ( Best Director . Ordinary People 1980 ) captures the majesty of the Montana wilderness and the strength of the American family in this acclaimed adaptation of Norman Macleans classic memoir . Craig Sheffer stars as the young Norman , and Brad Pitt stars as his brother Paul , an irresistible daredevil driven to challenge the world . Growing up , both boys rebel against their stern Minister father ( Tom Skerritt ) . While Norman channels his rebellion into writing , Paul descends a slippery path to self-destruction . Also starring Emily LLoyd as wild-hearted Jessie Burns . The film won an Academy Award for Best Cinematopghaphy in 1993 .  
  The Maxx is a deep psychological introspective lightly camouflaged as a weird-out superhero story . Julie Winters is a " freelance social worker " in an unnamed filthy city , ridden with crime , and she and everyone she knows has a lot of issues to work through . The Maxx is her friend and client , a street bum who thinks he 's a costumed superhero - or is it the other way around ? The Maxx is not to be missed for the artwork , the story itself , or the excellent voice work - particularly the late Barry Stigler 's deliciously urbane , drippingly evil voicing of the main villain , Mr . Gone . If you get the chance to see this , don't miss it .  
  I 've read reviews of Kerching on IMDb , and frankly , I 've not seen one positive review , until now . I actually like Kerching . Kerching is about a teenage boy named Taj Lewis , in order to make £1,000,000 for his mother , he sets up a website called rudeboy . The website offers a lot of interesting things , if only Taj , and his 2 friends - Danny and Seymour can stop Taj from getting exposed . I find this show quite funny and I enjoy watching it . The acting is O.K. , but it can definitely be better , the characters are funny , especially Danny Spooner , Taj 's friend , his stupidity is what makes him funny . and Taj 's other friend Seymour . Also Carlton , the owner of the café'e called " The Chill . " We never see him , we only hear him . Taj 's younger brother Omar , and his older sister Missy is funny too . And Missy 's best friend Kareesha . So many times Taj 's has almost got exposed , almost . As well as the comedy , the drama in Kerching such as love life and the loss of loved ones makes this programme great .  
  This was the first PPV in a new era for the WWE as Hulk Hogan , The Ultimate Warrior , Ric Flair and Sherri Martel had all left . A new crop of talent needed to be pushed . And this all started with Lex Luger , a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion being given a title shot against Yokozuna . Lex travelled all over the US in a bus called the Lex Express to inspire Americans into rallying behind him in his bid to beat the Japanese monster ( who was actually Samoan ) and get the WWE Championship back into American hands . As such there was much anticipation for this match . But every good PPV needs an undercard and this had some good stuff . The night started off with Razor Ramon defeating Ted DiBiase in a good match . The story going into this was that DiBiase had picked on Ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after his shock loss to the 1-2-3 Kid on RAW in July . Ramon , angry , had then teamed with the 1-2-3 Kid against the Money Inc tag team of Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster . To settle their differences they were both given one on one matches DiBiase vs Ramon and Shyster vs The Kid . Razor was able to settle his side of the deal after hitting a Razor 's Edge . Next up came the Steiner Brothers putting the WWE Tag Team Titles on the line against The Heavenly Bodies . Depsite the interference of " The Bodies " Manager Jim Cornette , who hit Scott Steiner in the throat with a tennis racket , they were able to pull out the win in a decent match . Shawn Michaels and Mr Perfect had been feuding since Wrestlemania IX when Shawn Michaels confronted Perfect after his loss to Lex Luger . Perfect had then cost Michaels the Intercontinental Championship when he distracted him in a title match against Marty Janetty . Michaels had won the title back and was putting it on the line against Mr Perfect , but Michaels now had a powerful ally in his corner in his 7 foot bodyguard Diesel . Micheals and Perfect had an excellent match here , but it was Diesel who proved the difference maker , pulling Perfect out of the ring and throwing him into the steel steps for Shawn to win by count out . Irwin R Shyster avenged the loss of his tag team partner earlier in the night , easily accounting for the 1-2-3 Kid . Next came one of the big matches of the night as Bret Hart prepared to battle Jerry Lawler for the title of undisputed King of the WWE . But Lawler came out with crutches , saying he 'd been injured in a car accident earlier that day and that he 'd arranged another opponent for Hart : Doink the Clown . Hart and Doink had a passable match which Hart won with a sharpshooter . He was then jumped from behind by Lawler . This bought WWE President Jack Tunney to the ring who told Lawler that he would receive a lifetime ban if he didn't wrestle Hart . Hart then destroyed Lawler , winning with the sharpshooter , but Hart refused to let go of the hold and the referee reversed his decision . So after all that Lawler was named the undisputed King of the WWE . This match was followed by Ludvig Borda destroying Marty Janetty in a short match . The Undertaker finished his long rivalry with Harvey Wippleman , which had started in 1992 when the Undertaker had defeated Wippleman 's client Kamala at Summerslam and continued when Wippleman 's latest monster The Giant Gonzales had destroyed Taker at the Rumble and then again at Wrestlemania , with a decisive victory over Gonzales here . Gonzales then turned on Wippleman , chokeslamming him after a poor match . Next it was time for six man tag action as the Smoking Gunns ( Bart and BIlly ) and Tatanka defeated The Headshrinkers ( Samu and Fatu ) and Bam Bam Bigelow with Tatanka pinning Samu . This brings us to the main event with Yokozuna , flanked by Jim Cornette and Mr Fuji , putting the WWE Title on the line against Lex Luger and it was all on board the Lex Express . Lex came out attacking , but Yokozuna took control . Lex came back though as he was able to avoid a banzai drop and then body slam Yokozuna before knocking him out of the ring . Luger then attacked Cornette and Fuji as Yokozuna was counted out . Luger had won a fine match ! Balloons fell from the ceiling . The heroes all came out to congratulate him on his win . Yokozuna may have retained the title , but Luger had proved he could be beaten . The only question was , who could beat him in the ring and get that title off him ?  
  Who votes in these ratings ? " Jacknife " is a beautifully acted , brilliantly observed piece of work , with actors on top of their game , especially Ed Harris and the peerless Robert DeNiro ( please don't mention Marlon Brando in the same breath of this man-see " Taxi Driver " for confirmation of this point ) . Is it a ' mundane ' movie because it doesn't have sex / meaningless action / nudity in it . This movie is about the complexities of the characters involved . Ed Harris makes you feel every moment with him and his emotional outburst towards the end is heartbreaking . The part where he orders a young man in a bar to take off his army clothes is a wonderful observation of how fashion and the movies exploit tragic situations and how frustrated real men must feel to see a young upstart sporting military attire . While we are on this subject , " Casino " 7.8 out of 10 ? One of the greatest films of all time , from one of the greatest directors , starring THE greatest movie actor of all time , with the scariest film psychotic gangster ever , only warrants just above average ? COME ON !  
  This is not a good movie but I still like it . The cat Clovis is gold in a jar as well as the premise of the cats themselves - intrinsically opposed to the evil Sleepwalkers . I think there is more to this movie than people realize , basically it is very harsh , but this brusqueness can sometimes be good . It 's got the corny lines , the abrupt ending and a comedic element conveyed by the bumbling policemen . Did anyone find the incestuous element a bit disturbing ? Ultimately this movie is casually and randomly acrimonious , which is quite effective , I liken it to Psycho - the relationship between the mother and son , the changing of protagonists . I think the abruptness works also , this is not a movie that you want them to lengthen , it only works if it 's short . I 'm still not sure whether the director lacked depth , or whether he did these things with purpose , we know Stephen King has ability , yet I haven't even read his books , only seen some of his movies . Anyway , I liked it . If you like harsh corny movies with 80 's overtones just watch it . but don't expect too much . It really is so bad its good .  
  I understand that Paramount wanted to film this with the Rodgers and Hart score , but couldn't work out the copyright problems , so Burke and Van Heusen who wrote the between them the most songs for Bing Crosby contributed a very nice score . I read Leonard Maltin saying that this movie , " fit Crosby like a glove " and I couldn't have put it better . No , it 's not Mark Twain 's satire , it 's a Bing Crosby film and in 1949 Crosby was the most bankable star in Hollywood . For once Paramount used technicolor and Rhonda Fleming was never lovelier on the screen . This was a woman that technicolor was invented for . William Bendix 's Brooklyn origins kinda stand out , but it 's to a good comic effect . The trio of Crosby , Bendix , and Sir Cedric Hardwicke have a rollicking good time with Busy Doing Nothing . Bing has one of his patented upbeat philosophical numbers with If You Stub Your Toe On The Moon . The third song he sings Once and For Always by himself and with Rhonda Fleming . That song was nominated for best song , but lost to Baby It 's Cold Outside . Nice also that Bing managed to record the score for Decca with Rhonda Fleming and Bendix and Hardwicke . One thing I like about this film is that it shows Crosby 's comic talents without Bob Hope . I like the Road pictures , but Bing was a comic talent onto himself and this film better demonstrates than any other . This is Crosby at the top of his game .  
  Yes , this is an ultra-low budget movie . So the acting isn't award winning material and at times the action is slow-paced because the filmmakers are shooting longer sequences and not a million instants that then get edited into a movie . This film makes up for that with an outstanding script that takes vampirism seriously , explains it and develops a full plot out of it . Aside from the vampire story , we get detailed genetics info , legal and law enforcement , martial arts action , philosophical musings , and some good metal music . Kudos go to Dylan O'Leary , the director / writer / main actor . It is beyond me how this man could have fulfilled all these roles and do them so well . I think to appreciate this movie , you have to be well-versed in all sorts of themes to see that the writer did a lot of research and knows about all these things . There are some great camera work , too , interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack - something I haven't seen before , but which pays homage to the underwater zombie attack in Fulci 's Zombi . The casting is good , in so far as the sexy female is sexy indeed . The main vampire also looks perfect for the role . The female victim looks vulnerable . My only complaint is that for a low budget horror flick , there should have been more nudity . If you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story , this flick is for you . I 'm looking forward to seeing future projects by Mr . O'Leary .  
  for my opinion , the middle of the film , specially the love scene is a bit too long , but the whole time you can imagine this desert feeling . but the best , what made this film unforgettable are the great explosion pictures , their color , slowmotion and the pink floyd music are unique in filmhistory ! destruction in its propper and popular form .  
  In the early 1970s , many of us who had embraced hippy / acid / alternative culture wholeheartedly , had realised that mainstream society was not going to change in the way we thought it would . For me this film defined the tension of " now what ? " that many of the people I knew felt at that time . Do we head for the commune and create our own vision of utopia or do we radicalize and push for change ? From the futile gestures to police , the radical rhetoric , the music of Pink Floyd , to the love-making and the explosive images in the desert - so much is in there . It captures well a significant moment in time .  
  When this film was made , the hippie thing had gone mainstream . The ideas of the counter culture was well established , that is why such a big film could be made . Yet it has something to say , and it is said really beautifully . Apart from those who 're only waiting for the wanking material , this film is given credit for its beautiful scenes ( which in itself is more than enough reason to see the film ) by the most . The soundtrack to this film , which actually became more popular than the film itself , is another plus . Pink Floyd 's " Careful with that axe Eugene " suits really well with the explosions , the absence of music in other scenes gives the film a nice quiet mood . But . It seems as though the messages in this film have been overlooked by the most . If you didn't understand it , which seems to be the case for the most , I 'll give you some hints : The man ( tough guy , what ever his name is-Mark ? ) is a part of a " reality group " . He leaves this group saying something like " I 'm willing to die . But not of boredom " He later go for a joyride with a stolen plane , probably to seek some action . As he is in the air , Grateful Dead 's Dark Star ( from the Live / Dead album ) is played ( i think ) . This song contains the phrase " Shall we go you and I while we can " , this is though not heard in the film . ( Perhaps stretching it a bit too far meaning that quote is essential ? ) In the plane , he checks up a girl ( Daria ) , who is driving in her car to a conference ( about giving typical suburban families the opportunity to live in a super-relaxing place in the desert , where everything is so simple and nice . For the whole family ! ) , by diving down , almost hitting the car . He lands the plane , and joins the girl on her way to Detroit . They stop at Zabriskie point , where they enjoy each other as living creatures and the nature . Later a family with a big car ( of the type which you sleep in ) and a speed boat is showed visiting Zabriskie Point , the father saying something like " what a waste driving all the way up here " , and the kid sitting inside the car , grinning . I sensed a " this wasn't much better than on the telly " - attitude . Daria takes Mark back to the plane which now is painted in a psychedelic style , with the identity number changed to " no war " on one side and " no words " on the other . " Bucks Sucks " is also written on the plane . Mark takes the plane back to where he stole it from , saying to Daria before he leaves " I don't risk anything " or something , one of several hints about he not caring too much about his destiny . ( This because he has the feeling that the environment that surrounds don't give him anything - " I wonder what happens in the real world " ) On the airport he is met by police officers who shoots him even though he just has returned the plane . Daria hears this on the radio , but decides to go to the conference in the fancy mansion . Here she feels alien after the adventures with her just killed friend . She enjoys fresh water running down a rock , more than the swimming pool . Inside the house the viewer is once again given a hint about anti-materialism - She looks out through a glass wall , holding her hands on the glass like she was trapped . The business men is seen arguing , the one side eager to make a big deal , the other afraid of losing money . Daria leaves the house and looks back at it , visualizing it blowing up . After the house , several other things blow up , for example a television . She smiles , happy she has inside herself destroyed what she after the meeting with Mark look upon as something negative . To summarize : Mark obviously experience the " reality group " as not very useful as they just sit and talk , taking no action . He clearly has bad feelings about things being as they are , and it seems like he feels that it 's no use fighting against it . He wants to leave . He helps Daria , who is " in mind but not in action " seeing his point of view . Where his feeling of being misfitted turns out leading to his death , one can hope Daria uses the ideas in a way that will turn out more constructive . In the film you see how a town ( LA ) is being polluted by commercial ( too bad you have to show the commercial to make the point ) , you see business men deciding what is the future , et cetera , and you see people being unhappy with these and other situations which is parts of the modern world . I have only seen the film once , so I have not caught all points , but I certainly got a feeling of what this film has to say , and I find it strange that this film can be called meaningless . If you say the points are being too obvious , I can see why , this film probably intended to appeal to the post-hippie radicals " digging " the thoughts of anti-establishment . Even though , it has a lot to say , and its message is still needed today , things pretty much evolving in the same direction as it did before the sixties . Zabriskie Point is a really great film , telling a story about quite normal young people ( not far out hippies tripping around tip toe on acid , digging everything ) seeking what they percept as real , dissatisfied with the conventional . And it is done in a truly beautiful way .  
  This is a great documentary film . Any fan of car racing should own a copy of this outstanding film . Director " Stephen Low " did a great job , as well as the main stars of the film , Father & Son , Mario & Michael Andretti . The DVD looks & sounds amazing . And best of all it 's IMAX ! Great home theater test disc .  
  I contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating / approving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered . NO ONE I know wanted to see this movie based on the previews , and EVERYONE who actually saw it ( that I know ) absolutely loved it .. The advertising campaign is disgrace / disaster / blunder . Opened at # 4 behind .. # 1-Rush Hour , which I have not seen , average IMDb score of 7.4 . # 2-The Bourn Ultimatum , which I have seen , awesome movie but 3rd week out , average IMDb score of 8.7 ( deserving I would say ) . # 3-The Simpsons Movie , which I have seen , okay movie but 4th week out , average IMDb score of 8.1 ( a bit high in my opinion ) . # 4-Stardust , average IMDb score of 8.4 ( lower then Bourn , but that 's been our for 3 weeks ) . Whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising I think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time ! This should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy / fairytale and not advertised as just another fairytale Too bad : ( Anyway - Now that I have very pointlessly ranted on-and-on .. Awesome movie , go see it !  
  For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry 's highly respected novel , this film will definitely impress you , because of how honorable an adaptation it is . With the exception of one minor subplot , Sturla Gunnarson 's feature film debut is an almost dead-on recreation of the book ( down to the last line ) . For those of you who have not read the novel , this movie might be a little tricky . It is certainly not a large cinematic drama story . Instead it has a strong element of realism to it , but I would not have it any other way . The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale , Hindu version of ' Fiddler On The Roof ' . Instead of a Jewish / Russian milkman , the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970 's Bombay during the time of the Muslim / Hindi war with Pakistan . He is forced to deal with a number of unexpected problems in his life , including his sick daughter , his individualist eldest son , a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money , and an unhealthy neighborhood . The Ending is not a happy one , nor is it a sad one , but that is essentially what realism involves . Such a Long Journey is a fine little movie , but if you want to see it , then good luck finding it . Unlike the novel , it has received very little release .  
  Astaire and Rogers at the height of their popularity . In 1936 Americans thought of the Navy as a place for song and dance . WWII was still a few years away . Fred and Ginger dance up the town . The plot is decent , but who cares .. By the way , notice the cameo roles for Betty Grable and a glamorous Lucile Ball . A load of Irving Berlin songs , including the famous " Let 's Face the Music and Dance " . In that scene , Ginger 's heavy swooping dress smacks Fred in the face during one of her spins and almost knocks him unconscious . Fred insisted on keeping the take as the dancing was superb nonetheless . Ginger once commented that she was a better dancer than Fred , since she had to do all the same moves , in step , and backwards .. Come to think of it , Fred 's voice was nice too . The man was effortless in motion . Here 's a movie to cozy up on the couch with a loved-one , kick off the shoes , and enjoy the entertainment .  
  One of the best of the Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers films . Great music by Irving Berlin . Solid support from Randolph Scott , Harriet Nelson , Lucille Ball , Betty Grable , Frank Jenks , and Astrid Allwyn . Terrific songs include " Let Yourself Go , " " Let 's Face the Music , " and " Putting All My Eggs in One Basket . " The last song is introduced by Astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a cute dance with Rogers . Rogers also sings " Let Yourself Go " with Grable among the backup singers . Harriet Nelson ( then Hilliard ) sings two nice songs and plays Rogers ' mousy sister . " Get Thee Behind Me " is a song that sticks with you for days . She also sings " But Where Are You ? " Snappy and fast paced , this entry in the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the better ones . The classic and amazing beautiful finale , " Let 's Face the Music and Dance " is among the best-known of their numbers . Rogers wears one of the great dresses in movie history .. a shimmering sequined number that swirls around her legs as she dances ( weighted hem ) and is also slightly see through . Just gorgeous . This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters re-created in Pennies from Heaven . Randolph Scott seems an odd choice as Astaire 's pal but he also appeared in their Roberta with Irene Dunne . Luckily he does not attempt to sing or dance . It seems that Grable and Ball would have had bigger parts in 1936 but they have a few scenes and make little impact . Allwyn has the bigger role but is only OK . Rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series with " Let Yourself Go " .. Jazzy and thumping , it 's a great song . Fun all the way , although I got tired of " We Joined the Navy " after the third time ..  
  Oh my , from the box description I thought it would be LA-crazy like 2 Days in the Valley or Hugo Pool . Ulrich Seidl must be a very strong man . Most , after directing this , would have driven off a cliff or at least committed a mass murder . I confess to only watching the first half hour ( for now ) . Reading all the comments here , I have a lot to look forward to . Professional reviews often mention the Swedish film Songs from the Second Floor as a parallel but that 's graced with humor and fantasy and this is unrelenting in its dour realism . What hath the Marshall Plan and the EU wrought ? Seeing this in a theater with anyone I know would have only resulted in an enforced departure after many fewer minutes than I got through on DVD . There 's a more annoying creature in the universe than Jar Jar Binks - the Hitchhiker from Hell . Whatever happens to her , it isn't enough ! Soulless suburbia that I thought only existed in Arizona and Florida thrives in Lower Austria . Oh no ! I thought sex clubs had ceased to exist even in New York and San Francisco , and here they are in suburban shopping malls ? Was it Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru who said when asked about Western Civilization , ' why that might be a nice idea ' ? If the world were truly like this film , bring on that black hole , we 're ready .  
  There is something special about the Austrian movies not only by Seidl , but by Spielmann and other directors as well . This is the piercing sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the movie . Hundstage is no exception . This effect is achieved not only by the depicted stories but also by actors playing . In Hundstage I have never had the feeling that these are actors playing , but real people instead . So real is the visceral feeling of the viewer .. Almost as if the grumpy pensioner or lonely lady in the movie are living below you in your block . Any person living in Vienna can without any doubt painfully recognize the people in the movie with their meckern / sudern ( complaining ) , their hidden sexual urges and the prolo macho guys . This is further reinforced by the Viennese dialect which is , according to many , especially made for complaining as a way of life . A special parochialism and arrogance typical for Vienna are also very well portrayed . The Viennese suburbs have a vivid presence in the movie with their stupor and drowsiness where nothing happens . Moreover , they have been turned into a celebration of materialism with shopping malls and huge department stores . Inbetween are the houses of the people where they indulge into what they reckon is pleasure-giving activities , trying to stay in touch with their human selves , yet in vain . The examples are the sexual game of the old lady with the men which bordered on rape , the prolo guy losing his nerves and hitting his girlfriend and the young woman who hitchhikes and irritates her drivers . The film has no soundtrack as it concentrates on the normality / abnormality of its images only . Another typical feature of Seidl ( and other Austrian directors ) is his showing of disturbingly sexual images . These include the stripping of the old woman for her husband , the sexual scenes in the bath , the sexual game of the lady with the two men in her apartment , etc . In Hundstage Seild has portrayed the lives of people who eventually may be as much Viennese as they could be citizens of Paris , New York or Madrid . The viewers should not despise or feel pity for the Viennese in the movie as they themselves could become victims of the same human estrangement and alienation , albeit in different circumstances . In the end , I believe Seidl 's film is a warning to us about the terrible state of human relationships so brutally revealed in Hundstage . And if the viewer does not succumb to the reasons for this evil transformation , Seidl has achieved his goal .  
  OK , so the FX are not high budget . But this story is based on actual events . Not something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors , even richer ! As most movies that are based on books , there are somethings that just don't fit . Only a couple of people have stated that this movie was based on real events , not a knock-off as most people believe it is ! This movie is in no way related too TWISTER ! Other than both movies are about tornadoes . For those of you who have problems with the science of the tornadoes and storms in the movie , there are a couple of things you need to remember .. The actual " night of the twisters " was June 3 , 1980 . So this movie was released 16 years after the actual events . Try think how far storm research has advanced in that time . It happened in a larger town ; Grand Island , Nebraska is the third largest city in the state . Even though the movie calls the town something else , and says it 's a small town .

  Stardust Another Guarded Review ( originally written June 15 , 2007 ) The marketing machine has only just begun for this one ( no site yet ? wth ? ) , so I doubt most of you have heard about it . In truth , I hadn't either ( sort of ) . When I got the posting , I thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was Transformers , one of the movies I want to see when not working so I an enjoy it 100 % as a mere mortal movie-goer . Turns out , it wasn't Transformers and I had been aware of it way back when as ' that Neil Gaiman movie ' . What is it about ? Well , in short , it 's a Gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star . Any more than that and I 'd be giving away plot info which is ( a ) a breach of contract , and ( b ) spoiling your fun . If you really want to know what it 's about , go buy the book . Rumour has it , Gaiman might be something of a writer . Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile . And for this one , it certainly was . This screening was ' special ' in that it included not just film critics , but also exhibitors ( they rarely have a mixed screening ) and local sci-fi / fantasy folks . So , you know the expected audience , right ? I mean , with this crowd and the title of Stardust , I knew what to expect . Oh how sweetly wrong I was . Yes , it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom . But it was not Lord of Rings . It was not even another Lord of the Rings wannabe ( ahem , Eragon ) . It was much more intimate than all that . But , like Lord of the Rings , it was the , well , humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities . It 's surely a romantic tale , but with generous splashes of humour . And that humour is of the sort which is not slapstick Shrekism . It 's more along the lines of dramedy than comedy . Before I go on , let 's do this movie review thing . Acting is , in the very least , good . It 's always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but I do believe there were significant superbly acted roles . Michelle Pfieffer is not , sadly , one of those . She plays a villain , and she does the job . Nothing special . Rupert Everett , though , he was a real jerk . That is , a great villain . Peter O'Toole is , well , Peter frickin ' O'Toole - which is marvelous . Ricky Gervais is perfectly cast and shows why . Robert De Niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part . When he wanted to deliver the goods , though , he did . And Charlie Cox ( who ? ) as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy I ain't never heard of . Claire Danes . Claire Danes . Claire Danes . I 've always been of mixed opinion with her . She can be great , and then she can seem to miss the mark . In this , she 's the former . And she is , quite literally , the star of this film . Sure , her accent stumbles here and there . And , yes , she 's not as good as she can be when Cox isn't in the scene . However .. well , see for yourself . Special effects are muted yet accomplished , and only significant where they should be . Best flying ship yet - sorry Potter . Direction is light-hearted and flows nicely . Cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in New Zealand . All else is top bracket . And now that that 's done .. .. the writing . Oh , the writing ! Neil , you devil . It 's hard in today 's climate to do anything original and , at first , you begin to wonder . A kingdom , a dying King , a boy out to prove his own worth , witches , ghosts , a quest ( or three ) - what 's new ? But Gaiman 's story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart . And , though you suspect how it 's all going to turn out , you begin to wonder in the third act and - if you 're me - find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best . In the end , you 'll find this story , this movie , is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not . Fantastical and real . ( I wish I could talk about Septimus vs Tristan but I won't ruin it for you . For those who read the book , rest assured , it 's done properly . ) Those I spoke to afterward had the same impression I did . A great film for all ages to enjoy , and the new { WITHHELD } for this generation . The blank gets filled-in only after the movie is in wide release because , well , you might be expecting it . You 'll know when you walk out , anyway . I sincerely hope Stardust doesn't get lost among the tentpoles . Even if it does , it 'll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone I know . - Forgot to add the { WITHHELD } reveal . I 'm a few years late , but .. " A great film for all ages to enjoy , and the new THE PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation . " Perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but I 'm still confident that years form now , there will be the same " Oh , I love that movie , " response to this as there is now for The Princess Bride .  
  I 'm overwhelmed by the work of Jim Carrey . I keep on getting this movie stuck in my head . The Grinch liking Martha May , Cindy Lou ( who 's very annoying ; her sweet innocence ) who tries to get the Grinch in the Christmas spirit , the childhood of the Grinch ( very funny ! ) , and moreover the weak obvious ending with - Christmas isn't all about presents . I have to say , I felt stupid walking out of the theater with a bunch of babies and toddlers laughing and so forth , but this movie was a good full-lengthed adaption of Dr . Seuss 's short film and IS for all ages .  
  When the Grinch came out I was excited though I thought it was going to be a happy go lucky film and it was . Though it did have a little Nightmare before Christmas touch to it . You know kind of dark and spooky . I loved this film because it helped fill people with the Christmas spirit . So mostly the Grinch saved Christmas . And what happened then well in Whoville they say that the Grinch 's small heart grew three sizes that day . MERRY GRINCHMAS !  
  This highly derivative film will be entertaining for the many who have not seen some of the more obscure anime films . I enjoyed most of it , especially after the rather flat opening minutes in the museum ( although the pre-title sequence is very entertaining and includes some of the better bits of animation ) . James Garner as the Commander and Leonard Nimoy as the King give impressive performances .  
  While I have a great respect for Disney 's animated films , as of late they haven't really been what I would call " must-see " . Atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer , and thankfully lived up to my expectations . Atlantis is a more " mature " Disney film in the sense that it lacks songs ( a very unusual trait for a Disney film indeed ) , and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent Disney offering . The world of Atlantis , hidden beneath the earth 's core , is fantastic , presented as desolate caverns with ruins , and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems , which , while usually containing some reminder of harshness , become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is reached . The presentation of simply Atlantis ' landscape and setting , without some expendable cheery song , gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance . The inclusion of an Atlantean language , as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations adds to this , and works fairly well . Also , with the exception of some scenes involving Mole 's practical jokes , there didn't seem to be much of a " childish " element that I usually associate with Disney films . Instead , the main elements were the struggle to get to Atlantis , and the constant discovery that occurred at Atlantis , as Milo the outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the Atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they didn't know about . Part of this involves the Atlantean " weaponry " , which is used in a very action-packed climax which is , for lack of a better word , quite exciting . Granted , not all of the story makes full sense , and the film doesn't feature any amazing new computer-generated visual effects , but , aside from the Toy Story movies , this is the most entertaining Disney film I 've seen in years .  
  The inspiring story of Carl Brashear ( Cuba Gooding , Jr . ) , a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy , aspiring to be the first black Master Diver in Navy history . We are shown the series of struggles from boyhood on that Brashear has to overcome to make his dream come true ( and then to keep it alive . ) Not the least of the challenges was Master Diver Bill Sunday ( Robert DeNiro ) , the head trainer at the diving school the Navy sends Brashear to , who is not especially sympathetic to Brashear 's goals , but who ultimately becomes an unlikely friend and supporter . This is a good movie ; fast paced and with a lot of action , although not an " action " pic in the normal sense of the word . There 's a very human story here as well , and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it ; there 's also a sense of the struggle that took place in the 1960 's between older and younger naval officers ( the " old navy " vs the " new navy . " ) The performances are quite good - particularly Goodings ' . I thought DeNiro was perhaps a bit over the top in his portrayal of Sunday ( although , who knows , Sunday might well have been this extreme kind of loose cannon ) and the portrayal of Sunday 's wife Gwen ( by Charlize Theron ) also made me question whether these parts were " jazzed up " to provide entertainment value . A good movie , though . I never once wondered if it was worth tuning into . 7/10  
  Several posters have quoted Renoir voicing his desire to make a film showing Ingrid Bergman smiling to camera . The short answer is wouldn't we all whilst the harsh reality is that only a select few got to do so . At this stage of her career Bergman couldn't get arrested ; in 1949 she left Hollywood to make a picture in Europe , fell for director Roberto Rossellini and never looked forward . After five turkeys in Italy she was probably ready to open a vein but within the year , after making this for Renoir , she was back where she belonged and with an Oscar to boot for Anastasia . This is one of three movies that Renoir made in color around this time and on balance it 's better than The Golden Coach , which isn't hard , and about even with French Can Can . Renoir probably figured that with so much going for her Bergman could get away with a couple of wooden leading men and Renoir picked two doozys in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer , solid mahogany in both cases . The plot is actually based on a real incident in French history but Renoir is content to give it a once-over-lightly and concentrate on replicating the paintings of his father in set up after set up . In its pastel colors it resembles another film of the period Les Grandes Manouvres which is no bad thing . All in all it remains a pleasant trifle showcasing a beautiful and charismatic actress .  
  This film , recently voted as an audience favorite at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival , is inspiring and moving . A famous conductor , forced to retire by illness , returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader of the church choir , and finally find fulfillment in his music . Drawing on Sweedish traits of keeping things within oneself and of the insular character of a small Swedish village , this film develops each of its characters well . superbly directed , acted and sung , it brought tears to many eyes , and smiles to all . Hopefully it will find distribution in the United States . If you can , see it !  
  Despite being told from a British perspective this is the best WW II documentary ever produced . Presented in digestible ( as digestible as war can be ) episodes as the grave voice of Laurence Olivier connects the multitudes of eye witnesses who were forced to live the events of that horrific time . Eagerly awaiting its appearance on DVD in the U.S. The Europeans had their opportunity with a release in DVD earlier this year .  
  Utterly brilliant . Powerful and evocative . The most compelling documentary series ever made concerning war . It 's tone offers a stark contrast to the often gung-ho attitude towards World War 2 that the media exhibits . Rather than opting for screaming about the horror of war , it allows Sir Laurence Olivier 's quiet voice to take a back seat to the true images of war : corpses everywhere , explosions , terrified citizens and soldiers , broken men , indifferent politicians , mistakes that cost thousands of lives , the suffering of the innocents . Most of all it truly brings home that mankind is capable of when all normal rules of " civility " are removed . There is something distinctly Hobbesian about man in a true state of nature , he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate 60 years on . Perhaps there could be a follow up series called " The century at war " for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors . I feel it is an irony of immense magnitude that it took an event which caused the death of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series such as this .  
  I really enjoyed this movie . Most of the reviews have been bad , but most critics think a movie should be like an idea drama . This movie has a little bit of drama , but the rest is just clean fun and very entertaining . Forget about Julia Roberts being a Pretty Woman , Emma Roberts is a beautiful young lady and there is more to her than just that . Emma was so much fun to watch in the role of Nancy Drew . It is good to see a new face . I believe she will go far . Nancy Drew may not be based upon the books , but the story is still good . There is also a good blend of other character actors and supporting actors like Pat Carroll , Barry Bostwick , Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan - not credited . I 'm surprised Disney did not release this movie . Some people may not like this movie because it does not contain sex , violence , and cursing . This is a good family film which is rare in this day in time . So take your family , see this movie and judge for your self how good it is . I can't wait for the sequel .  
  Looking for Quo Vadis at my local video store , I found this 1985 version that looked interesting . Wow ! It was amazing ! Very much a Ken Russell kind of film - quirky , stylized , very artistic , and of course " different . " Nero was presented not so much as evil incarnate , but as a wacky , unfulfilled emperor who would rather have had a circus career . He probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of " leading " an empire - it wasn't much fun , and fun is what he longed for . Klause Maria Bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all it was worth . Yes , Nero persecuted the Christians with a vengeance ; one of many who did so . At one point one of his henchmen murmurs : " No one will ever understand we were simply protecting ourselves . " He got that right .  
  Much in the same way Frank Miller and his Sin City comics used black and white to express itself ( and its film noir influences ) , so does Christian Volckman with Renaissance . It is the year 2054 , in Paris . In the tradition of science fiction , the future is a bright , sparkling multi-teared jewel . This is a jewel in a setting of misery , inequity and darkness ; bright and beautiful on top with a dark underbelly beneath . One of these " bright " people at the top , a research scientist from a very large and influential global company ( Avalon ) , is kidnapped . The well known and efficient , Captain Karas ( voiced by the new James Bond himself - Daniel Craig ) , is assigned the task to find her . The plot and layout is not overly original . It is heavily influenced by film noir , Gibson 's Neuromancer and other detective stories , along with movies like Blade Runner , Sin City , Fritz Lang 's Metropolis and Minority Report . There is the main plot , surrounded by other possible sub-plots that all connect at the end . It is not hard to figure it all out . The movie 's strength and originality is in its intense visual presentation . Paris is an intricate array of levels and sub-levels . At its base is the more primitive industrial infrastructure . As the city rises , so does its architectural complexity and luminescence . Yet in this structure , the top does not equate with elevation of human ideals and behavior . Paris has been intricately animated and laid out in brilliant black and white . The movie is closer in spirit with Sin City ( the comics ) then Sin City the movie was with its source material . This is done all the more easy , because it is still remaining in relatively the same medium ; animation . Much in the same way as a Scanner Darkly pushed the visual aspects of story telling , so does this . The light and dark , black and white creates an atmosphere of contrasts , as well as visual ambiguity . Right and wrong , black and white can lose all meaning at the same time it is right in front of us . The movie proves how black and white can be both ambiguous and obvious at the same time . In keeping with the spirit of the movie , I can be both critic and fan . I can love and loath in the same light . It is definitely an experience I recommend for lovers of the visual arts . So pour another Black and Tan , enter the void and enjoy the ride .  
  This was different , that 's for sure . Just look at the cast ! Talk about oddballs . William H . Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars , although a bunch of actors almost share the spotlight , in this farce about superhero-wannabees . The most outrageous was played by Paul Reubens of " Pee Wee Herman " fame . There is lots of humor , garish colors and no lulls . It 's a pretty entertaining , lightweight comedy with nothing but goofy characters , all of whom want to be heroes a la Superman , Batman , Spiderman , you name . They have talents in strange areas , however , that the real heroes don't ( and don't want to ! ) . It 's silly , but you know that going on . It 's also a film you can watch in installments and not really miss any continuity . It 's a long movie for one so hectic , so taking a break here and there is okay . The language was tame so kids could enjoy this , too . In fact , I don't recall any swearing in here , except the guy in the theater next to me who kept uttering , " What a dumb , f-ing movie . " I thought it was fun two hours but I 'd rather watch it on DVD and take a few breaks .  
  i really liked the first 2 seasons . because a lot of good characters disappeared later on . like most shows are kinda slow at first then get better in later seasons , but this is the absolute reverse . jenny from the 1st season and Valarie from the 2nd season were Sabrina 's friends , i really didn't care for the others , jenny and Valarie were her coolest friends . i think for some reason , the producers wanted us to not like her college friends for some reason , they were so cruel to Sabrina . but my favorite episode from season 1 is cat showdown and my favorite episode from season 2 is witch trash , that is the funniest episode . i also thought it was funny how Libby was popular but she was always jealous of Sabrina , and never seemed to have a real boyfriend but was always wanting to be with Harvey . i just wished they could have made more better ones . i also liked how the first 2 seasons , during the opening credits Sabrina would say a few words while wearing a costume , like in the pilot episode where she 's in the witch costume , i liked how she said " this is so not me " and later on she kept trying to change herself to something else is what i think , but this is a really cool show . it is kinda like the andy griffith show in a way because it good at first but once it turned color and barney fife left , it was longer good . but i still like to watch it , but the only reason i watch later seasons is because of sabrina . what i meant about the opening sequence is : the opening titles of seasons 1-3 shows Sabrina in front of a mirror posing with several different costumes and outfits as the cast members ' names quickly flash on the bottom of the screen . At the end , Sabrina would say some sort of pun that related to the outfit she is wearing , then disappear . the opening sequence of season four includes the characters in bubbles . the opening credits of seasons 5-7 features Sabrina at various locations around Boston  
  I have this movie on DVD and must have watched it thirty times by now . I must really love it , right ? Well , not really . I was a surfer earlier in my life , and I loved the sport . To this day , I am fascinated by good surfing . Riding Giants has plenty of that , and thus I am a sucker for the thing . But I definitely have some bones to pick with it . ( Peralta , you listening ? ) . First , the movie has too little faith in its subject matter . The cutting and editing of the waves is such that the majority of them are sort of ruined . Very , very few waves are actually shown ridden from start to finish . Peralta seems addicted to a hyper kinetic , cut-and-pace method . It gets especially bad in the middle section on the spot Mavericks in Northern California . Not a single wave is ridden start to finish . Almost the entire section on Mavericks ( one third of the movie ) is a jarring montage of clips with an equally jarring soundtrack . I can understand the effect Peralta was trying to achieve with Mavericks , as the place is a truly frightening mix of bone crushing waves in frigid open ocean chop , but he goes way too far . Mavericks is not just a bad acid trip . Waves are actually ridden there , even with great performances . It would have been good to see some of them . If Peralta thinks this is a grand sport ( and I am sure he does ) , then why does he insist on messing with the subject matter so much ? At times , the editing reduces the movie to the inscrutable . There is one fast clip in the section on Peahi in Hawaii , which I still cannot understand . Even if I run it on slow motion on DVD , the image is too fast to be decipherable . It must be a couple of frames in length at the max . Second , have the guys who made this thing ever learned about understatement ? It is particularly galling to watch the narrated directors ' version on DVD . These guys sound like two over-the-top valley girls . The same sentiment shows up in the main production . Every thing is always so goddamn " amazing " etc . One character in particular is just plain obnoxious - Sam George , the editor of Surfer Magazine , who is practically peeing in his pants every time he has anything to say . He is a super drag on the movie . There is a tremendous amount of effort that went into this movie . I mean , just to get the old movie shots they have , and also , all of the interviews . The movie is a great story , and I think it is generally captivating entertainment . Thematically it is well laid out , with the three parts centering around Greg Noll , Jeff Clark , and Laird Hamilton respectively . There are some uses of still photography that are phenomenal . In the directors ' narration , they say it is a new type of 3D technology , and it really works . The three principle characters shine , both in their interviews and in the water . As an athlete , Laird Hamilton is a revelation . He rises to the pinnacle of his sport in a way that I have only seen Michael Jordan do in basketball . And too , the story of his meeting his father is a gem . It really touched me . It is just that the movie could have been so much more . The very last part of the movie , when the credits roll , gives a hint of what it could have been . There are some beautiful panoramic shots of waves with a magnificent soundtrack . ( The soundtrack in the rest of the movie is rubbish , though you may like it if you are fan of the modern , frenetic school of rock . ) Anyway there 's my two cents ..  
  The fully rounded character of the principal role of this movie , that of the cop torn up by his past and on a path of self-destruction so clear to the viewer , is unique for its time , 1950 . Along with the haunting music and the well written plot , the film is a prime example of film noir at its best . Close-ups of Dana 's eyes reveal the anguish within , Karl Malden excels as his boss , who brooks no nonsense but also has compassion for those under his command in the precinct . Otto Preminger made this type of movie just about his own . If there is any fault it would be with the breath taking beauty of Gene Tierney who seems oddly out of place with the hardened cop . Their scenes in the cafe , however , are wonderful and ring true . Tom Tully , in the bit part of her father is perfect as is Gary Merrill as the hood . Great lighting and mood setting . The building where the deadly deeds take place highly atmospheric , I love the old woman in the basement . 8 out of 10 .  
  We 're a long way from LAURA . Once again Otto Preminger directs , Dana Andrews stars as a police detective named Mark , and Gene Tierney is the beautiful woman who haunts him , but nothing else about WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS resembles everyone 's favorite sophisticated murder mystery . Instead of deliciously quotable dialogue we get gritty , harrowing realism . While the earlier film took place in the ritzy upper echelons of New York society , here we 're in the low-rent district of dark streets , hoodlums , cheap restaurants and crummy flats . Tierney , gorgeous as ever , now works as a department-store mannequin and lives in Washington Heights ( the neighborhood of the " doll " who once got a fox fur out of LAURA 's Mark McPherson ) . This time Andrews is Mark Dixon , an older , sadder , more troubled version of the cool cop in a trench coat . WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS belongs to a sub-genre of noir , movies about police brutality focusing on cops who can't control their violent impulses . Like Kirk Douglas 's character in DETECTIVE STORY , Dixon owes his seething contempt for crooks to his father 's criminal past . Where Douglas is self-righteous and blind to his own faults , Andrews is burdened by repressed guilt and self-loathing . He accidentally kills a suspect and covers up his actions with an attempt to throw suspicion on a slimy gangster ( Gary Merrill ) whom he has been vainly pursuing for years . Instead , a kindly cab driver is suspected because he 's the father of the dead man 's estranged and mistreated wife Morgan ( Gene Tierney ) . Dixon , falling in love with the wife of the man he killed , tries desperately to save her father without giving himself away . Among noir protagonists , Dana Andrews had this distinction : he was incapable of appearing unintelligent . Even when playing an average Joe , as he usually did , he always comes across as unusually sensitive and perceptive ; more than that , his air of being too thoughtful for his own comfort gives him that haunted-and haunting-quality that was his essence as an actor . He played ordinary guys , cops and soldiers , but always with a tragic undercurrent of seeing and knowing too much . His conscientious heroes are marked by exhaustion , guilt , the inability ever to " lighten up . " No other actor could have expressed so well the bottled-up anger , the slow-burning pain , the agonized intelligence of Mark Dixon . He also has a muted tenderness , a muffled warmth and even wry humor that make him heartbreaking . This comes out when he takes Morgan to a restaurant where he 's a regular , and for the first time we see this cold , brutal man trading mock insults with the waitress , whose sarcasm can't hide her affection and concern for him . When Dixon asks his partner for money to get a lawyer for Morgan 's father , he supplies it even though they recently argued and Dixon threw a punch at him . There are no words about loyalty or knowing he 's a good guy deep down , but we see it all in the man 's anguished silence and his wife 's resignation as she hands over some jewelry to pawn . Dixon 's goodness comes across through other people 's reactions to him as much as through Andrews 's deeply moving performance . Though Dana Andrews was a minor star , he may be the quintessential forties man . He goes through some movies hardly ever taking off his overcoat ; with that boxy , mid-century silhouette , further fortified by the fedora , the glass of bourbon , the cigarette he doesn't take out of his mouth when he talks , he looks imprisoned in the masculine ideal of toughness and impassivity . While many noirs romanticize the two-fisted tough guy , WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS offers an unflinching portrait of the reality behind the façade , a gripping and melancholy exploration of the roots and consequences of violence . Andrews was sadly underrated in his own time ( he was the only one of the three protagonists in THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES not nominated for an Academy Award , though his low-key performance is far more compelling than Frederic March 's hammy , Oscar-winning drunk ) . Fortunately , Andrews appeared in some films that ensured his immortality , and now at last this little-known film , which contains his best performance , can be seen as part of the marvelous Fox Film Noir set . This series , including a number of never before released titles ( such as NIGHTMARE ALLEY and THIEVES ' HIGHWAY ) , suggests that Twentieth-Century-Fox may have had the finest record of all the major studios when it came to film noir .  
  Unlike another user who said this movie sucked ( and that Olivia Hussey was terrible ) , I disagree . This movie was amazing ! Olivia Hussey is awesome in everything she 's in ! Yeah she may be older now , because many remember her from Romeo and Juliet , but she 's wonderful ! This story line may be used quite often , but it 's a unique movie and I 'll fight back on anyone who disagrees ! I enjoyed this movie just as much as I have any other Olivia Hussey movie . Olivia 's " my girl " and I love her work . I saw this for the first time on Saturday ( 4/14/07 ) and fell in love with it . Not only because 's it 's an Olivia movie , but because of it 's unique story line and wonderful direction .  
  A DOUBLE LIFE has developed a mystique among film fans for two reasons : the plot idea of an actor getting so wrapped up into a role ( here Othello ) as to pick up the great flaw of that character and put it into his life ; and that this is the film that won Ronald Colman the Academy Award ( as well as the Golden Globe ) as best actor . Let 's take the second point first . Is Anthony John Colman 's greatest role , or even his signature role ? I have my doubts on either level - but it is among his best known roles . Most of his career , Ronald Colman played decent gentlemen , frequently in dangerous or atypical situations . He is Bulldog Drummond ( cleaned up in the Goldwyn production not to be an arrogant racist ) fighting crime . He is Raffles , the great cricket player and even greater burglar , trying to pull off his best burglary to save a friend 's honor . He is Robert Conway , the great imperial political figure , who is kidnapped and brought to that paradise on earth , Shangri-La . He is Dick Heldar , manfully going to his death after he learns his masterpiece has been destroyed and knowing he is now blind and useless as an artist . I can add Sidney Carton and Rudolf Rassendyll to this list . But here he is not heroic . In fact he is unconsciously villainous - he murders one person and nearly kills two others . It does not matter that he is obviously mentally ill - his behavior here is anti-social . To me Colman should have gotten the Oscar for Heldar , or Carton , or Conway - all more typical of his acting roles . But the Academy has a long tradition of picking atypical roles for awarding it 's treasure to it 's leading members . Colman 's Anthony John is a very good performance , and at one point truly scary . When alone with Signe Hasso in her home , she at the top of a staircase and him at the base , they have an argument . She demands that " Tony " leave , saying she won't see him . He stares at her , his face oddly hardening in a way he never used before , and he says , " Oh , no you won't ! " He starts moving upstairs , frightening Hasso , and she runs into her room . He stops himself and leaves . It actually is the real highpoint of his performance - even more than his assaulting of Hasso on stage , or of Edmond O'Brien , or his killing of Shelley Winters . It showed his blind fury . For that moment it was ( to me ) an Oscar-worthy performance . But it is only that moment . I 'm glad he was recognized for the role , but he should have gotten the award for a more consistent performance . His actual performance in the Shakespearian role of Othello is not great , but bearable . Too frequently he lets the dialog roll off his tongue in a kind of forced singing style ( one wonders if that was due to the coaching of Walter Hampden , who probably knew how to handle the role properly , or a reaction to it ) . Nowadays " Othello " is played by an African American actor more frequently than a white one . Paul Robeson 's brilliant performance in the role set that new tradition firmly into place . But the three best known movie performances of the part are those of Colman , Orson Welles in his movie of OTHELLO , and Laurence Olivier in his movie of his play production of OTHELLO . All three white actors did the role in black face . My personal favorite of the three is Welles , who seems the most subtle . But even watching Welles ' fine film version makes me angry that Robeson never got to put his performance ( with Jose Ferrer as Iago ) on film . Now the first question - can an actor get that wrapped up in a role ? I heard different things about this . Some actors have admitted taking a role home with them from the theater or movie set . Others have found a role they have to be stimulating , influencing them on a new cause of action regarding their lives or some aspect of life . But actually I have never heard of anyone who turned homicidal as the result of a role . It seems a melodramatic , hackneyed idea . As a matter of fact it was not a new idea in 1947 with Cukor , Kanin , and Gordon . In 1944 a " B " feature , THE BRIGHTON STRANGLER , starring John Loder , had used a similar plot about an actor who is playing an infamous " Jack the Ripper " type , and who starts committing those type of killings after an accident affects his mind . There was an earlier movie in the 1930s , in which an actor playing Othello gets jealous of his wife ( I think the title was MEN ARE NOT GODS , but I 'm not sure ) . But due to Colman 's name and career , and Cukor 's directing , it is A DOUBLE LIFE that people think of when they recall this plot idea . It even reached comedy ( finally ) on an episode of CHEERS , where Diane Chambers is helping an ex-convict who may have acting talent , and they put on OTHELLO at the bar , just after he sees her with Sam Malone kissing . Only Diane is aware of the personality problem of the ex-convict , and can't delay the production long enough ( she tries to start a discussion into the history and symbolism of the play ) . The cast of A DOUBLE LIFE was first rate , and Cukor 's direction was as sure as ever . So the film is definitely worth watching . But despite giving Colman an interestingly different role , it was not his best work on the screen .  
  Peter Weir 's first international success , THE LAST WAVE is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on Aboriginal myth . Richard Chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving Aboriginal tribal rivalries . David Gulpilil plays one of the suspects , who does his best to guide Chamberlin thru the realm of ' Dreamtime ' , an alternate reality / timeline central to native Australian history and tribal custom . Heavy on atmosphere , deliberately ambiguous in plotting , the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects , probably due to budgetary limitations . Nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as ' reality ' will stay with you .  
  I was absolutely blown away by John Cassavetes 's Opening Night . It 's the first movie of his that I 've seen that seems to be on a bigger scale , thus it feels more mainstream , but it still doesn't feel as if he grounded himself any more than he has in his previous films . That is perhaps what makes it so intense . There is also something undoubtedly cathartic about watching this movie . It 's about what in fact Cassavetes has made a staple of his career , an ideal that he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here expressing it in front . Rowlands 's character , middle-aged stage actress Myrtle Gordon , cannot bring herself to play her role in the upcoming production as written so she uncalculatedly follows impulse after impulse , resulting in what appears to be chaos on stage , until she finds the right one . It 's a daringly abstract premise . This is a movie that does not fail to capture the innate steering that one goes through during an emotional cleansing . No one understands why Myrtle does many of the things she does , and it is seen and even portrayed as something destructive , yet it just might be the best thing for her . It may be a cleansing rather than a breakdown . A withdrawal , a cocoon , a rebellion , it all culminates into a meltdown . Cassavetes gives her character a brutally real touch , which is that early on , she is ardently arguing that she has nothing in common with her character , yet she is in quiet but emotionally corroding fear that the opposite is true . The last scene , the climactic performance that Myrtle shares with a character painfully estranged from her who is acting with her , is one of the most interesting , hilarious , hard-hitting , enlightening , and enjoyable moments I 've ever seen in a movie .  
  Typical De Palma movie made with lot 's of style and some scene 's that will bring you to the edge of your seat . Most certainly the thing that makes this movie better as the average thriller , is the style . It has some brilliantly edited scene 's and some scene 's that are truly nerve wrecking that will bring you to the edge of your seat . The best scene 's from the movie ; The museum scene and the elevator murder . There are some mild erotic scene 's and the movies pace might not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie . So this movie might not be suitable for everybody . The story itself is also quite good but it really is the style that makes the movie work ! It might be for the fans only but also casual viewers should appreciate the well build up tension in the movie . There are some nice character portrayed by a good cast . Michael Caine is an interesting casting choice and Angie Dickinson acts just as well as she is good looking ( not bad for a 49-year old ! ) . The musical score by Pino Donaggio is also typically De Palma like and suits the movie very well , just like his score for the other De Palma movie , " Body Double " . Brilliant nerve wrecking thriller . I love De Palma ! 10/10  
  It came by surprise . . . the impact & resoloution this film had on my automatic way of being reactive to people & situations . Most vividly was the stirring of the emotion anger . Much like the way a spoiled child would be when reacting to not getting their way . . . a temper tantrum if you will . Thinking I was hiding this anger from others was the most ridiculous farce of all . What was this costing me ? Soo much love . . . soo many blessings . Now I 'm present to how incredible humbling myself feels , and having an ongoing attitude of gratitude for life . . . for what is happening in the moment , without my wild expectations for life to be a particular way , the way I think life or people " should " be . This film has contributed to the freedom I now feel to connect with others , without limits & expectations . . . and to connect with genuine love . . . without fear of loss . . . just to love first , and accept what love is given .  
  It was released in France on dvd several years ago-I wish it would be re-released with English subtitles . Do not confuse this with a remake with Penelope Cruz which gets poor reviews . Gerard Phillippe is a peasant who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the daughter of the king . He sets off to join the army and goes to war . His love , however , is Gina Lollabrigida in an early movie for her . I won't spoil the end . Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age , a great loss to moviedom .  
  A guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus . She refuses him , but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway . And there it starts - a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero . It can't be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic . In short , a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film . And IMO , it succeeds at being a nice film . It 's no masterpiece , but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion - the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is , even with the superhero thing going , believable . So . Thin story , but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time . 7 out of 10 broken hearts  
  First , I did like this film . It was well acted by all . However , I don't understand comments I hear from people about a surprise ending . I knew nothing about this movie going in except a few " gotta-see " recommendations , but I knew where the plot was going in under ten minutes . ( I won't mention what clued me in so as not to spoil a good film for others . ) Still , despite it seeming obvious , I kept watching . It was nice to see how everything played out , filling in the details and the character motivations in later scenes . I don't hate it when I guess the ending early in a film . I only hate it when the road to resolution is lined with boring scenery . Will Smith 's screen persona is just likable , even when he 's playing such a troubled character . He 's energetic and believable in everything that I 've seen him do . Seven Pounds is another fine performance . Rosario Dawson is a solid performer , portraying a quirky , rather upbeat character despite a terminal heart condition . Beauty is in the eye of the beholder , and with Rosario , if you don't find her gorgeous , you should think about replacing your eyes . It was nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the screen . I haven't seen him much lately , but that could just be me . Woody didn't have a tremendous amount of screen time , but he sold his jolly , piano-playing , blind man character for all it was worth . Excellent . A cursory bit of research on the box jellyfish tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic , neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic . I would think this makes it a questionable choice for both pet and plot . Overall , I have to recommend this film not for the plotting , but for some very good performances , and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions that we generally try to avoid .  
  " The first war to be 100 % outsourced . " Dan Ackroyd 's line says it all . This is a hard to describe film ; comedy , satire , action , screwball . It reminded once or twice of Dr . Strangelove , especially so in the scenes featuring Ben Kingsley ( who did a remarkable job I think ) . I had no particular expectations of this film , though I am a big John Cusack fan , so I just let the movie wash over me . And as a result I was quite entertained . The political satire is painfully accurate and quite damning of the US military-business complex . The sub-plots were somewhat predictable but the final interweaving of story lines made them all worthwhile . I can understand why this film was not terribly popular in the US , but for the rest of the world , it is a timely tale .  
  This film is an entertaining , fun and quality film . The film very cleverly follows the guidelines if the book , and tries to stick to the exact lines . The actors are all suitable , and you would expect them to be the part . They use some famous actors which give a great effect on the film . The graphics is a bit dodgy in some parts , and there are quite a few mistakes throughout the film . There is no such thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard , for example . The camp is not as gruesome as explained in the book , and they tend not to show the goings on in the camp as much as the book . All of his group are mentioned a lot in the book , but are not in the film . Overall , a great film for a rainy afternoon  
  Hello . This movie is .. well .. okay . Just kidding ! ITS AWESOME ! It 's NOT a Block Buster smash hit . It 's not meant to be . But its a big hit in my world . And my sisters . We are rockin ' Rollers . GO RAMONES ! This is a great movie .. For ME !  
  This film is brilliant ! It touches everyone who sees it in an extraordinary way . It really takes you back to your youth and puts a new perspective on how you view your childhood memories . There are so many layers to this film . It is innovative and absolutely fabulous !  
  This is a perfect series for family viewing . We gather around the TV to watch this on BBC America . It is an up-to-date version of Robin Hood and it appeals to children and adults alike . Our teenager and tween-ager both enjoy sitting with mom and dad and watching Robin 's next exploits . We can't wait for the next episode to air each week and are glad for the free " On Demand " viewing . The wardrobe has a spot of current fashion . There is a moral to each story . It is entertaining . The violence is not over-the-top or needless . The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a John William 's feel to it . It is an old world tale that is brought to life again with a new world flair . There is so much garbage on television from brain rotting " reality " TV to senseless violence . You should take this for what it is and that is an updated " Robin Hood " not to be compared with the movie exploits of Errol Flynn . This is a gem to be enjoyed by all . Parents that are concerned about their children watching too much violence will enjoy that Robin has lost his taste for war and bloodshed . He is a Robin Hood that would rather attempt to reason his way out of a disagreement than fight . Maid Marian is also an appealing role model for young girls . Rather than stand by and do nothing , she takes her own role in helping the poor by being the " Night Watchman . " The Sheriff of Nottingham is deliciously over the top wicked , just as the Sheriff should be and looks like a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry . Guy Gisborne is played by an extremely handsome actor , one that makes most women wish he didn't have portray the role of a bad " Guy " . The only question we have is " Where is Friar Tuck ? "  
  Peter O'Toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor . The lovely Susannah York provides a good foil for O'Toole 's dramatic presence . The film alludes to incest-without a single explicit scene-but it is able to entertain the viewer in its raucous social commentary . Though this is not major film by any reckoning , it will be remembered for its entertaining performances . Even York , signing the papers at the end , is a treat to watch , exuding tragedy silently . The possible weakness here is Thompson 's laid-back direction . But the film floats because of the actors and the script . I saw the film twice over a period of 20 years-on both occasions with the name " Brotherly love " . " Country dance " is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this movie , wherever it was released as such .  
  Fascist principal Miss Togar ( Mary Woronov , who is lensed by expert photographer Dean Cundy as if she were ten feet tall ) has a plan to turn her high completely square . Complications ensue which challenge that goal in delightful rock'n'roller Riff Randell ( PJ Soles who lights up the screen-she 's got a hot bod , too ) who is an obsessive fan of the punk band THE RAMONES . Pal Kate Rambeau ( Dey Young , whose big rimmed glasses and nerdy role can not hide her stunning beauty ) joins forces with Riff to put an end to the supposed crisis of killing rock'n'roll for good which is Togar 's desired mission . Vincent Van Patten has a hilarious role as Tom Roberts , a success at everything , but getting laid . Kate is crazy about Tom .. if only he could pull his head out of the sand and see it . Clint Howard steals the film almost ( honestly , who can steal this film away from Soles ? ) as Eaglebauer , " the supplier " who can get everyone almost anything . His office is located in the boy 's restroom ! Paul Bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of Riff 's when he enjoys a concert of THE RAMONES . A raucous high school romp that defies all rules of normalcy .. and I loved it . It 's like someone just says , " Let 's make life fun for 1½ hours . " The film really is anarchy .. a plot-less chaos lovingly adoring THE RAMONES with all it 's heart ( even if they are horrible actors , they have an opportunity to gain new audiences with this film ) . The ending pretty much sums up the film as a whole .. Riff and her classmates take over the high school and one massive party begins . To be honest , I didn't want the party to end ! Not conventional in any way whatsoever , this film just let 's loose a frenzy . Accompanied by a great rock soundtrack featuring some of THE RAMONES best songs , this film allows a viewer to accept a time in life when war didn't dominate headlines and people just had a good time . Those , I guess were the days .  
  The Ramones , whom I consider the founders of modern punk rock , lend their then-unique sounds to a terrifically twisted movie about a rowdy rock fan ( P.J. Soles ) who faces off against a merciless , joyless principal ( Mary Woronov ) for the right to rock . Featuring a soundtrack brimming with incredible music , RRHS is fascinating in concept and execution . It 's chock full of riotous sight gags ( like the mouse experiment ) , teenage spirit ( probably my all-time favorite film opening ) , and bizarre , off-the-wall moments ( the straitjacket scenes ) . If you 're looking for a movie that seems to be made of pure fun on a molecular level , look no further . But if you 're looking for a nice , dignified , dramatic epic , maybe you should look a wee bit further . " Hi everybody , I 'm Riff Randell , and this is Rock & Roll High School ! "  
  The first time I saw this movie , I fell in love with it . The atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost . I expected a gore fest , but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack ( it 's actually my ringer at the moment : P ) . The fact that I couldn't predict when he 'd kill and when he 'd disappear was a major plus in my book . Predictable horror movies bore me . Now , I know the storyline had some discrepancies , but , if you 're like me , you don't even notice them until long after the movie 's over and you 're laying in bed mauling over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion . Finally , as I mentioned , the soundtrack is timeless . It 's one of my all time favorite theatrical scores , so I was very happy to hear that Rob Zombie is leaving it untouched in his remake . Speaking of the remake , I read a very comprehensive article on it and , now that I know that Mr . Zombie reveres John Carpenter , I have high hopes for his take on this classic . This movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tingling , but it 's the perfect addition , opener , finale , you name it for an All Hallow 's Eve movie marathon . : )  
  In a time of magic , barbarians and demons abound a diabolical tyrant named Nekhron and his mother Queen Juliane who lives in the realm of ice and wants to conquer the region of fire ruled by the King Jerol but when his beautiful daughter Princess Teegra has been kidnapped by Nekhron 's goons , a warrior named Larn must protect her and must defeat Nekhron from taking over the world and the kingdom with the help of an avenger named Darkwolf . A nicely done and excellent underrated animated fantasy epic that combines live actors with animation traced over them ( rotoscoping ) , it 's Ralph Bakshi 's second best movie only with " American Pop " being number one and " Heavy Traffic " being third and " Wizards " being fourth . It 's certainly better than his " Cool World " or " Lord of the Rings " , the artwork is designed by famed artist Frank Farzetta and the animation has good coloring and there 's also a hottie for the guys . I highly recommend this movie to fantasy and animation lovers everywhere especially the new 2-Disc Limited Edition DVD from Blue Underground . Also recommended : " The Black Cauldron " , " The Dark Crystal " , " Conan The Barbarian " , " The Wizard of Oz " , " Rock & Rule " , " Wizards " , " Heavy Metal " , " Starchaser : Legend of Orin " , " Fantastic Planet " , " Princess Mononoke " , " Nausicca : Valley of the Wind " , " Conan The Destroyer " , " Willow " , " The Princess Bride " , " Lord of the Rings ( 1978 ) " , " The Sword in The Stone " , " Excalibur " , " Army of Darkness " , " Krull " , " Dragonheart " , " King Arthur " , " The Hobbit " , " Return of the King ( 1980 ) " , " Conquest " , " American Pop " , " Jason and The Argonauts " , " Clash of the Titans " , " The Last Unicorn " , " The Secret of NIMH " , " The Flight of Dragons " , " Hercules ( Disney ) " , " Legend " , " The Chronicles of Narnia " , " Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire " .  
  Why this movie has all but disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime . " Conan " is perhaps the only Sword and Sorcery movie better . The brutal violence , cool character designs , and good pacing , make this one of the best fantasies around . It is certainly the greatest animated movie aimed at a more adult audience that I have ever seen . This is not similar to Bakshi 's usual frenetic style . It 's quite a departure for Bakshi , and in my opinion his best work . I hope that this film gets the recognition it deserves .  
  This film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever . Ever . But in my opinion it is possibly the funniest . The horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless . I bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain DVD 's at my local pound shop . Me and some friends then watched it , admittedly whilst rather drunk . It soon occurred that this wasn't any normal film . Instead a priceless relic of what will probably be James Cahill 's last film . At first we were confused and were screaming for the DVD player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no-one could be bothered . Instead we watched the film right through . At the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream , something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours , whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons . We soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed , this wasn't a work of abysmal film . This was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at . This was a film that anyone can enjoy . This was genius .  
  After watching this film last night on Sundance , I realized that much of Nakata 's style was first done in this film . Here we have many of the same elements of the RINGU series , especially the idea of the media being the source of the supernatural . Instead of the cursed videotape , we instead having a haunted studio and strange images appearing on film . In fact , the strange images appearing on film brings immediately the cursed videotape in RINGU to mind . The only thing missing was the obsession to water that runs through Nakata 's later films . The final scenes are quite chilling , with a bit of a nod to Murnau , what with the door opening by itself ands the ghost entering the room , reminds me immediatly of NOSFERATU . A chilling movie that will make think twice about going up to a catwalk .  
  No awards show can please all the people . Clearly if your favorite movies didn't win , you will say the show wasn't very good . That 's understandable . However , the 74th Annual Academy Awards will be remembered for one magical moment of Hollywood history : Woody Allen 's first appearance ever at the Academy Awards . Allen has often shunned the awards as being self-aggrandizing and pointless , and has never attended - even though he has won several of the coveted awards . When the 74th Academy Awards were held , the nation was still mourning the loss of life in the collapse of the World Trade Centers in New York . When it came time to pay tribute to the city of New York , they decided to show a video of the great movie moments form the city of cities . Then the announcer simply said : " Ladies and gentleman , Oscar Award winning Director Woody Allen . " The place erupted in an extremely long standing ovation . The entertainment industry finally got to give their applause to the Man from New York who usually avoids the Hollywood scene . As the applause died down , Woody applied some of his legendary wit to the situation . SOME HIGHLIGHTS : " Thank you very much - that makes up for the strip search . " " I thought they wanted their Oscars back , " he joked . " I panicked because the pawn shop has been out of business for ages and I had no way of retrieving anything . " " But that wasn't it . I couldn't work it out because my movie wasn't nominated for anything this year . Then it hit me - maybe they were calling to apologise . " Allen also disclosed why he had overlooked his lifelong Oscar-aversion for this one special night . " For New York City , I 'd do anything . So I got my tux on and came down here , " said Allen . " It 's a great , great movie town . It 's been a great , moving and exciting backdrop for movies and it remains a great , great city . "  
  This is a great story of family loyalty which , thankfully , doesn't resort to the usual tricks ( or at least the ones I 'm used to seeing in American and European films ) of supersentimentality or high dramatic tension . It 's very watchable and very lovable . It has some beautiful cinematography , but doesn't rely on that alone to entertain .  
  I had the privilege to see this movie at the Intenational Film Festival of Rotterdam . ' Xizhao ' or ' Shower ' is a $ 200.000 lowbudget movie about a father and his 2 sons . The father has a traditional bathhouse somewhere in a traditional Chinese village where local , mostly aged men , come to relax and to go bathing . The father has to sons : a ' retarded ' son who lives with him and a son who lives in a big modern city and who comes to visit him . To this son the traditional village , the bathhouse and his ' retarded ' brother seem strange and annoying , but this changes along the movie . Though the story may sound cheesy or cliche , it 's not . With really great performances , especially of the father and the ' retarded ' son ( sorry , I don't know their names ) and a great story the movie was touching and funny at the same time . If you got a chance to see this movie do it . It 's a great alternative to mainstream Hollywood cinema .  
  " Foxes " is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too fast in the 1980s . And unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it ( Porky 's , Fast Times at Ridgement High ) , the movie holds up well against time . Its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and Jodie Foster and sk8er boi Scott Baio ( remember him ? ) lead a fine young cast that 's well worth watching . The film follows four Southern California girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents . The teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties , concerts , or out on the street . Seldom are they home because instant gratification is a pill , party , or boy away . But rather than condemning them , the film is sympathetic , blaming absent , uncaring adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone . And the charismatic cast is impossible to dislike . The film 's opening  a long and loving pan - sets the tone for what follows . We see the girls asleep at daybreak amid the objects that define teen girlhood , from Twinkies to a picture of a young John Travola , while Donna Summer 's " On the Radio " is scored beneath . From there the movie picks up speed as the girls head off to school and to life . Annie ( Runaway rocker Cherie Currie ) is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill . Deirdre ( Kandice Stroh ) is the boy crazy drama queen . Madge ( Marlilyn Stroh ) is the shy girl in over her head . And Foster is the one with the plan . It 's her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line ( Sally Kellerman ) . It 's an almost impossible job and one that Foster ultimately fails at . Despite its age , " Foxes " remains a pleasure to watch . Dated hair , clothes , and references to Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill haven't hurt the movie . The cinematography is simply stunning , with breathtaking filtered shots of the L.A. basin at dawn , dusk and at night . Giorgio Moroder adds a 80s soundtrack featuring the likes of Donna Summer and Janis Ian . Perhaps the movie 's biggest disappointment is that the young stars around Foster never broke out like the casts of " St . Elmo 's Fire " ( 1985 ) or " Empire Records " ( 1995 ) . " Foxes " shows why they should have . But perhaps like Bowling for Soup 's song " 1985 , " they just hit a wall .  
  She is such an extraordinary singer , who cares about anything else ! That final scene is one of the best moments in all of show biz - bar none ! I 'm glad she kept the camera on herself for ten minutes - she deserves that iconic status - such is the power of the voice . I first saw this film when I was five and it had a huge impact on me . I see it today , and yes , I can see some of the flaws ( like Esther wanting to leave the Grammy 's right as her award is being announced ) . But some of the other user comments are just plain false - I mean , where is the gratuitous nudity - maybe we saw different films ? Streisand 's singing ability is monumental , and if she has a big ego - fine ! She 's earned it .  
  Coming of age movies are quite usual these days . For 1980 , " Foxes " really gives its meaning . Jodie Foster plays her character straight out . Ever since she did " Taxi Driver " four years earlier , she has a stronger character in this movie . She 's Jeanie , a high schooler who has plenty of guts , and seems to get out of any situation she 's in . Scott Baio plays Brad way before Chachi on " Happy Days " . He 's deemed immature by the other girls . Cherie Currie is Annie , hangs with the wrong crowd , chased by her policeman father . Jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand . Exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous . Annie is rescued by Jeanie and Brad all the time whenever she gets wasted . Reality comes back hard where she is killed in a automobile accident . And one gets married to a much older man . Growing up isn't easy , sometimes we got to explore life how it is . In reality , you got to be careful about the people surrounding you . For me , I was my own person , and I tend to stay that way ! Great music , great plot , this movie 's a gem ! 4 out of 5 stars !  
  I thought the movie was extremely funny and actually very interesting . It was raw and honest and felt as if I was really watching the " real people " not actors . It 's great entertainment , it also painted the people as human on our level not below us . It is a very good film .  
  It 's highly stylized , but this movie shows that real people appear on these shows and what seems like good fun and a chance to appear on television can have serious consequences . Yes , i 's mostly comedy , but there are some sad moments .  
  This show is awesome ! and I 've seen it about 6 times . Granted it may be lacking in educational content as some people like those sort of movies , but I think it 's great , very funny and excellently written !  
  " Foxes " is one movie I remember for it 's portrayal of teenagers in the late 1970 's . As I am exactly Jodie Foster 's age , I related to this movie . It deals with the frustrations , temptations , relationships & rebellion of youth . The soundtrack is great with inspiring rock eg . " More Than a Feeling " by Boston and sad numbers like " On the Radio " by Donna Summer . The music of my late teens . Yep , I 'll always remember this one , even if it wasn't huge .  
  Note : These comments are for people who have seen the movie . Vanilla Sky is a brilliant , complex , and thrilling movie that existentially explores exactly what the tag-line says : LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends . Maybe the movie plot can come into focus for confused movie-goers if one looks at it from a different angle . Considering the following : Now , I have not painstakingly gone through the film scene by scene , so I will have to further examine my assertions , ( and I welcome your thoughts ) but give this a try and see if the movie doesn't fall into place : Where exactly does the debatable ' splice ' occur ? Now , I 'm not talking about the splice as it is explained by the L.E. ' technician ' , since that sequence itself could be actually interpreted as a rationalization inside of David Aames 's mind / dream / coma state , but the true splice between reality and dream . It seems to me that the reality of the car crash , the way that it is filmed ( no explosion , for example ) is a likely ' splice ' point , and that any particular sequence containing an existential / dream / coma / non-reality feel to it - whether it 's shown onscreen before or after the crash - is actually a part of Aames ' personal journey toward self-realization inside of his own mind . In that respect , then , we are left with two questions at the very end ( if you know of more , let me know ) : is Aames actually disfigured , and where does he wake up ? If you don't get entirely wrapped up in the exact sequence of details in the plot , or at what particular point his dreams are scattered throughout , this movie becomes a fascinating exploration of a human on a journey to find himself and what that means in today 's pop-culture society .  
  " The Notorious Bettie Page " ( 2005 ) Directed By : Mary Harron Starring : Gretchen Mol , Chris Bauer , Lili Taylor , Sarah Paulson , & David Strathairn MPAA Rating : " R " ( for nudity , sexual content and some language ) It seems as though every celebrity nowadays is getting a biopic made about his or her life . From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash , biopics are very posh right now . " The Notorious Bettie Page " is the latest of these to be released on DVD . It features Gretchen Mol as the world 's most famous pin-up model , Bettie Page and was filmed mostly in black and white with certain excerpts in color . Unlike " Ray " , " Walk the Line " , and " Finding Neverland " , however , this movie is not going to be one to watch out for at the Oscars this year . This movie lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics and most of the more dramatic moments in Bettie Page 's life are either completely ignored or only merely suggested . This does not mean , however , that it is a bad movie . In fact , " The Notorious Bettie Page " is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling movie-a solid work of cinema . This film focuses more on Page 's exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography . It is filmed with fervor and care and Mary Harron 's direction captures the look and feel of the time period as most filmmakers only dream about . Everyone knows Bettie Page ( played by Mol ) . Whether you know her as an iconor a simple porn staryou know her . She is a woman who had a very profound impact on American culture only by revealing more skin than deemed appropriate at that particular time . Now , most people know her as one of America 's first sex symbols-a legend to many models , especially those of Playboy and other adult-oriented magazines . She lived in a time when showing just an inch of flesh below the waste could have someone arrested and Page 's bondage-style photos were just the thing to push the American public into an uproar . In fact , the photos launched a full-fledged senate investigation about common decency and the difference between harmless films and porn . The performances in " The Notorious Bettie Page " are absolutely wonderful with Gretchen Mol standing out . Her performance as Bettie Page is simply brilliant . I understand that , when she was announced for the role , many people were skeptical . Her name is not one that immediately leaps to my mind when I think of great performances . Now , it will . She completely aced the role and drew me in with her vulnerable and yet deeply engaging performance . David Strathairn is fresh off of last year 's " Good Night , and Good Luck " , in which he gave one of 2005 's best performances . Here , he gives yet another fine performanceeven though he is slightly underused . I was shocked at how very limited his screen time wasbut quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie . The only performance I have seen from Lili Taylor was that in " The Haunting " ( 1999 ) . While most people ignored the movie , I found it to be an enjoyable , if not completely shallow , horror movie and I also have always thought that Taylor was perfectly credible as the emotionally-distraught Nell . Here , Taylor gives yet another credible performance . She gives a very subdued performance and delivers the perfect performance to compliment that of Gretchen Mol . After everything was said and done , I realized that " The Notorious Bettie Page " cannot be compared to other biopics , such as " Finding Neverland " and " Walk the Line " . It is incomparable to these because it tells a story of a woman and her career , from the beginning to the end . Her personal life is briefly implied , but it is really her impact on the world that becomes the high point . We watch the film knowing that Page will eventually bare all and we know the impact that her decisions will havebut we are rarely shown the impact that they will have on her personal life . She is a woman that never looked back and could constantly reinvent herself . After all , she was an adult model turned Christian missionary . This movie does not over dramatize anything . It could have included fictitious moments of Page sobbing hysterically and begging God to forgive her . It could have shown Page running and screaming through the rain , trying to escape the ghosts of her pastand yet it does not . " The Notorious Bettie Page " tells a simple story and that is something rare by today 's standards . Fortunately , it is quite refreshing . Final Thought : " The Notorious Bettie Page " is a relaxing movie with absolutely amazing cinematography . Overall Rating : 9/10 ( A )  
  The first two-thirds of this biopic of fetish model Betty Page are very interesting . Betty , as portrayed with enormous sincerity by Gretchen Mol , comes across as a pleasant , girl-next-door type , who saw nothing wrong with what she did ( and there certainly wasn't anything " wrong " with it ) . Director Mary Harron , who also made " I Shot Andy Warhol " and " American Psycho " , recreates Betty 's America by mixing old black and white stock footage with new , degraded , black and white footage . Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager , color is introduced . Betty 's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw ( Lili Taylor , in a great performance , and Chris Bauer ) , as well as John Willie ( Jared Harris ) . The scenes where Harron recreates Betty 's bondage photography sessions are fascinating and adroitly executed . The early purveyors of fetish material are not portrayed too condescendingly and we get a sense that these folks were part of a tight " community " . Betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety , although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world . Because the film 's third act is virtually non-existent , we are left with the impression that we have been watching a feature length documentary on Betty Page rather than a structured drama . Flaws aside , it 's a film well worth catching and represents yet another fine feather in the cap of producer Christine Vachon .  
  For a film that 's ostensibly about sex and leather , it doesn't have any right to be as oddly sweet as it is . The story of Bettie Page , a good Christian girl from the South who 's momma wouldn't let her date until she married , who moved to New York and ended up becoming the most successful pin-up of her age , is driven by an outstanding performance from Gretchen Moll . Her Page can't quite reconcile the pictures that she takes ( nobody 's allowed to touch , it 's all fun and respectful ) with the pornography trials and supposed ill-effects that her images have on the world around her . Page has been an inspiration to every burlesque artist since , not just because she had a figure to die for , but because she invested every picture with an innocent sense of fun that was uniquely sexy and simple at the same time . Rather like this film , in fact . Filmde in both black and white and glorious technicolour , it 's a lovely way to spend a couple of hours .  
  I just can't believe that these games can get so much better , but they do . Unfortunately I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it , but even though I did beat it I can't wait to buy it for PS2 . This is the only series of games that I must own all of them even if I have beaten them many times over . I hope they never stop making this type of game even if the series must come to an end .  
  This project was originally conceived as the movie version of popular Japanese manga SlamDunk ! and that 's not something new to Jay Chou , who made his movie debut playing a character from another wildly popular manga Initial D . Along the way , it was decided to incorporate some kung fu into the movie , so hence the title , even if the idea wasn't very original , with Stephen Chow 's Shaolin Soccer coming to mind with martial arts and ball games combined . However , and thankfully , those scenes where kung fu actually influenced the games were kept to a bare minimum , and in Kung Fu Dunk , really quite unnecessary , because they don't add much to the plot nor drum up much excitement , and at most offered some cheap laughs and reminisced about the time when Stephen Chow used kung fu in football games . Jay Chou is comfortable in his role as a martial artist Fang Shi-jie since it 's not the first time he fought using martial arts ( Curse of the Golden Flower anyone ? ) , and under the stunt direction of Ching Siu-Tung , he was made to look really believable as he trashes countless of gangsters in a bar as seen in the trailer , just to let you know who 's boss . That was almost why his character is made a kung fu practitioner , and for the fact of giving him an excuse for being a top shot , able to shoot the hoops from practically any angle . And with Eric Tsang as a small time hustler Chen-Li who sees his potential and becomes his agent , he joins a university to play varsity basketball , but not without the initial objection of team captain Ting-wei ( Chen Bo-Lin ) and team star Xiao-lan ( Baron Chen , in his big-screen debut ) . But you know with team members on the same side , it 's not before long they combine their strengths to take on adversaries on the basketball court . And I will stick my neck out to say that this movie is to basketball just as how Goal was to football . It made the sport look good because of its charismatic characters , despite them dripping so much coolness and aloofness on the courts . Here , special effects and wire-work were employed to make the actors seem like professionals who can take out a top side in the NBA league , and in all honesty , really looked stunning , especially when they mimic various dunking moves , and performing combo-moves thanks to technology and stunt work . So in actuality , the kung fu elements don't really have to be in the movie . The stunt work itself will be able to justify most of the moves as they 're quite grounded to reality , only having you to suspend belief that boys of average height have springs in their feet to leap that height for a professional dunk . Pity too that the number of games were only a handful , with the time spent on plenty of subplots , but each were loosely developed and flitted in and out of the story as and when they please . Things like the abandoned Shi-jie 's quest to use the basketball games to get his parents to one day attend them , that of gangsterism penetrating and influencing games , and his love life with Charlene Choi in yet another flower vase role just to look good and do nothing else . Everyone 's acting a little too cool , leaving little room for main characters to add depth . One of the key themes here is the realization of the importance of teamwork rather than on individual talent and ability , and it could have been brought out much stronger if the players themselves interacted a lot more off the court , than only on it , and during competitive games , apart from the high-fives and friendly passes . With the US$10 million budget , it is easy to see where the money went to - the effects , in particular , a massive fantasy sequence at a crucial point in the movie . It 's quite flawless , nice to look at and probably justifiable on its quality alone , but again I like to emphasize , that even without those elements , the basketball stunts itself would still make this a decent movie with nifty basketball moves . And having Jay Chou playing for your team is a big boost to any hopes of a box office success .  
  Jay Chou plays an orphan raised in a kung fu school , but kicked out by the corrupt headmaster after fighting with a bunch of thugs in the employ of a nefarious villain . He happens upon down on his luck trickster Eric Tsang , who immediately sees cash potential in the youngster 's skills . Basketball is the chosen avenue for riches , and Tsang bids to get him a spot on a University team and to promote him in the media . General success leads to a basketball championship and a really nasty rival team managed by the same nefarious villain of before . It 's all a bit Shaolin Soccer I guess , but not so quirky or ridiculous - the plot sticks pretty close to sports movie conventions , and delivers all the elements the crowd expects from the set-up . You 've seen it all before , but it 's the kind of stuff it never hurts to see again when it 's done well . Luckily it really is done well here ( some might say ' surprisingly ' with Chu Yen-Ping in the director 's chair .. I expect he had good ' assistants ' ) - the script delivers and the presentation is slick and stylish . Jay Chou remains pretty much expressionless throughout , but such is his style , and when he does let an emotion flicker across it can be to quite good comic effect . Eric Tsang compensates with a larger-than-life character that he 's played many times before ( in real life , for instance ) who gets many of the films most emotional moments . Since the film revolves around basketball , it 's good that the scenes of basketball matches are suitably rousing . The cast show some real skill , including Chou , and some well done wirework and CGI add that element of hyper-real kung fu skill that make the scenes even more entertaining ( assuming you like that sort of thing ) and justify the movie 's plot / existence . There 's only one significant fight scene in the movie , but it 's a doozy in the " one against many " style . Jay Chou appears to do a lot of his own moves , and is quite impressive - he 's clearly pretty strong and fast for real , and Ching Siu-Tung 's choreography makes him look like a real martial artist . I wish there 'd been more , but at least it 's a lengthy fight . Very much the kind of Chinese New Year blockbuster I hoped it would be from the trailer , and recommended viewing !  
  A mess of genres but it 's mainly based on Stephen Chow 's genre mash-ups for it 's inspiration . There 's magic kung-fu , college romance , sports , gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping . The production is excellent and the pacing is fast so it 's easy to get past the many flaws in this film . A baby is abandoned next to a basketball court . A homeless man brings him to a Shaolin monastery that 's in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but can't read . The old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual . The school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is assisted by four wacky monks . The new master gets mad at the now 20 + year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the master 's weak punches and throws him out for the night . The boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a gangster 's club to play darts . This leads to a big fight , the boy 's expulsion from the monastery and the man 's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation . Al this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes . Aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie . The man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over . The plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film . I 'm sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end . The effects , photography and stunt work are all top - notch and make up for the uninspired plot . Stephen Chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this film will live in his shadow but that 's not a good reason to ignore it . It 's quite entertaining even with a scatter-shot ending . Recommended .  
  The great Vincent Price has done many fantastic Horror films , some of which range among the greatest genre gems of all-time . Price 's greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s , with films such as Roger Corman 's brilliant Poe-cycle ( still the greatest Horror cycle of all-time ) , Michael Reeves ' " Witchfinder General " ( 1968 ) or Ubaldo Ragona 's " The Last Man on Earth " ( 1964 ) marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man 's career . The films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal Horror icon he is , however date back to the 50s , with " House of Wax " ( 1953 ) marking his rise to stardom . " The Mad Magician " of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor . This is not to say , however , that this film isn't an original , delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself . As the lines above may suggest , Vincent Price is my favorite actor , and , while I personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in , none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gem . Price stars as Don Galico ( aka . Galico the Great ) , an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices , whose boss , a sleazy businessman , stole his wife ( Eva Gabor ) from him . When the boss takes away one of Galico 's ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival , The Great Rinaldi ( John Emery ) , Galico snaps , and a murderous spree of revenge begins .. Don't we love Vincent Price when he 's out for revenge ? Some of his most famous and greatest films such as " The Abominable Dr . Phibes " ( 1971 ) or " Theater of Blood " ( 1973 ) were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders , and this earlier film in his Horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as Vincent Price does . This film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for Price , who , as always , delivers a brilliant performance , and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every Horror fan . Another must-see for my fellow Price fans .  
  Lost is an extremely well made TV series about some people that are lost on an island . there 's so many twists and turns that you can't really decide who your favourite character is , one minute its him then he does something so he 's coolest then shes about to do something so shes the coolest then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like noo ! so you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is worth the wait . Suspense , action , romance , humour its got it all apart from the topless girls but thats good as it means that you can actually concentrate on the story more and story is what this is all about . so if you like a good story and like suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably better . ( i have a review on that too that you could check it out . ) I would give lost a good 8 out of 10 mainly because its so unpredictable , you never know what will happen next .  
  New York City houses one man above all others , the possibly immortal Dr . Anton Mordrid . Mordrid is the sworn protector of humanity , using his magical powers to keep his brother and rival , Kabal , chained up so that he may not enslave the human race . Well , wouldn't you know it ? A prophesy comes true and Kabal breaks free , and begins collecting elements ( including platinum and uranium ) for his alchemy experiments . With the help of a police woman named Sam , can Mordrid defeat his evil brother ? " Dr . Mordrid " comes to me courtesy of Charles Band in the Full Moon Archive Collection . I had not heard of it , which is a bit odd given that I 'm a big fan of Jeffrey Combs ( Mordrid ) and the film isn't that old . But now it 's mine and I can enjoy it again and again . The film certainly is fun in the classic Full Moon style . Richard Band provides the music ( which doesn't differ much from all his other scores ) and Brian Thompson plays the evil Kabal . We even have animated dinosaur bones ! What more do you want ? Of course , the cheese factor is high . I felt much of the film was a rip-off of the Dr . Strange comics . And the blue pantsuit was silly . And plot holes are everywhere ( I could list at least five , but why bother ) . And why does the ancient symbol of Mordrid and Kabal look suspiciously like a hammer and sickle ? Combs has never been a strong actor , so he fits right in with the cheese . These aren't complaints . Full Moon fans have come to expect these things and devour them like crack-laced Grape Nuts . I 'm guilty .. I loved this film . If you 're not a Full Moon fan , or a Jeffrey Combs fan .. you may want to look elsewhere . But if you like the early 1990s style of movie-making and haircuts , you 'll eat this up . Stallone and Schwarzenegger fans might like seeing Brian Thompson as a villain , looking as goony as ever and not being able to enunciate English beyond a third grade level . I did . I wish there was a " Mordrid II " , but the company that makes a sequel to practically everything ( is " Gingerdead Man 3 " really necessary ? ) passed on this one .  
  Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar , but is totally worthwhile . It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s . Which is why I 'd have loved to see follow-up movies .. but judging by the rest of Full Moon 's output there simply weren't enough tits to satisfy the typical audience . Unfortunately , thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate , because without em ' this could have been a Harry Potter-style magicfest that kids would have eaten up . Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I wasn't sure if Ms . Nipar hadn't wandered off an A-list picture onto this film , she was very believable . No , seriously ! Anyway - it 's a shame they didn't have the bucks to license Dr . Strange , because I think this could have been a total kiddie phenom .  
  I really enjoyed " Doctor Mordrid " . This is a low-budget film , which may be off-putting to some , but I have no problem with it . I admire it even more for that , considering it 's WAY more entertaining than the drivel that Hollywood churns out every year . Too bad this didn't get a theatrical release ; I don't know about anyone else , but I would have went to see it in theatres . ` Doctor Mordrid ' is a very entertaining science fiction film that just about anyone can enjoy , especially if they 're into sci-fi like I am . I don't see why this is a R-rated film ; only one f-word is said , and there are no gruesome death scenes , nor is there any blood at all . The timeless rivalry between sorcerers Anton and Kabal ( Anton wanted the use his powers to save the human race , while Kabal wanted to enslave them ) , gave the story a sense of enchantment , while the mythical plotline added charm to the story itself . Basically , this a film that 's just plain fun to watch . There is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie , though : seeing Jeffrey Combs keeping a straight face while wearing that silly blue cape and suit . That makes me laugh every time I see it . But I digress .. Anyway , the acting is great ; the main protagonists ( Anton , and his lady friend , Samantha ) , are very likable ; Anton is sympathetic , and hospitable , and Samantha is friendly . Plus , the settings were wonderful . The floating island in the other dimension was very cool setting ; we 're only given a glimpse of it twice , though ; it would have been great to see more scenes take place here . The main setting was also very neat ; Anton 's apartment is very roomy , and he has some cool devices , especially the monitoring system he uses to keep track of the world 's occurrences . He even has a pet raven that he keeps in his apartment named Edgar . Overall , this a great film ; it was fun to watch , and the main actors put a lot of feeling into their roles . If you can find anywhere that rents ` Doctor Mordrid ' , you should rent it ( or , in my case , buy it . It was definitely money well-spent ) ! My Rating : 8 stars out of ten .  
  Brilliant ! My wife and I joined the sprawling line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival . After seeing the film , I can understand why there was such a long line . Holly is a touching story about an impossible connection between two people . She is a young girl , he is a worn out westerner . The film grasped every bone in our body . There aren't any graphic scenes or anything that is hard to watch - its the surrealism of normality that really kicks you in the gut . The film is beautifully shot . Among others , we loved the scene where Patrick teaches Holly to ride a small motorcycle . Thuy Ngoyen 's rawness ( cant believe this is her first acting job ) and Ron Livingston 's performance stayed with me for a couple of days . Highly recommended .  
  I saw this film a few years ago and I got to say that I really love it . Jason Patric was perfect for this weird role that he played . The director ? I don't too many things about him .. and I don't care . The screenplay is good , that 's for sure . In just a few words I have to say about this movie that is weird , strange , even dark , but it 's a good one . I saw it a few years ago and never saw it since then . I want to see it again and again . I know that I 'm not gonna get sick of watching it . The scenes , the atmosphere , the actors , the story .. everything is good . The movie should have lasted longer . I think 120 minutes should have been perfect . I was hoping for a part 2 for this movie . Too bad it din't happened . Jason Patric : you 're the man ! very good movie . the end . : - )  
  I think " Anyway .. " is a kick-ass movie . Really . Tom Barman spent like years making it , and it shows : every scene is polished , has a meaning , .. I guess most agree on that . One thing many people tend to criticize is the " lack " of story . I 'm afraid that that 's an effect of us being overwhelmed with " traditional " storytelling , all the time . I mean : what you can achieve with a book , you can't achieve with a movie , what you can achieve with a movie , you cannot achieve it by just telling it to a buddy . The problem is that we 're so used to movies , series , .. to be just a filmed version of a story ; a visual recording of events - just like when you watch the news - that we expect every movie to have this epic characteristics : a strong storyline with a lot of unusual events . And I stress the idea of " unusual events " : most people see on TV in the news , in movies , series , .. very unusual things , once in a lifetime situations . And here , in " Anyway .. " , there are unusual events , but not in the same " hollywood big explosion " kind of way : guy gets fired , couple back together , car gets stolen .. and of course very usual things . And that 's strong : just being able to appreciate all of that , that universe , that 's art . And I agree that especially what can only be achieved in movies , that atmosphere created by the score and the photography is put central . But not like in traditional visual movies ( visual blockbusters such as the Matrix ) ; it serves the characters and remains deeply human . I mean , in every shot you feel the love that Tom Barman has for Antwerp and urban lifestyle . And he has no point with this movie , like to " learn " us something ; and he has no big story to tell with incredible scenario twists . He just shows everyday people with everyday lives , he shows a city , all with their good and bad sides and says : this is us , that 's our city , that 's life , let 's enjoy it . So basically , " Anyway .. " is not only that super groovy movie , it also has a much stronger " message " ( it 's not explicit , maybe even not intended ) than most movies how really intend to pass a message . One drawback : now , we 'll have to wait five years to see the next Barman pic , and everyone will expect so much of it ..  
  WRITTEN ON THE WIND , directed by Douglas Sirk and released in 1956 , is like all of Sirk 's mid 50 's films - pure melodrama . Yet it is engrossing , richly developed melodrama , and Sirk 's trademark lurid colour expressionism , throbbing , barely repressed emotions , symbolism and juxtaposition of the classes make this a film to crave . The film opens brilliantly , with the four central characters and the plot being introduced as the credits are still rolling . Sirk uses a clever flashback structure to take us into his world .. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are magnificent as the two Hadley " kids " , Kyle and Marylee . He drinks and sleeps around with women . She drinks and sleeps around with men . They both are worth millions , thanks to the Hadley oil business . Hunky , yet poor , Mitch Wayne ( Rock Hudson ) is Kyle 's lifelong friend , and Marylee 's dream lover . Enter into this sordid mess Lucy Moore ( Lauren Bacall ) , a slim , attractive young woman who falls under Kyle 's charms after he picks up a phone and flies her across the countryside one evening . Mitch loves her too , but Kyle wins her . They quickly marry , and Kyle stops drinking . But fate seems to be written on the wind , and it is not long before a conniving Marylee ( who will " have Mitch " , marriage or no marriage ) , a secretly smitten Mitch , the confused Lucy and the sad drunk Kyle come to blows .. Malone is just wonderful as Marylee Hadley , thoroughly deserving her Best Supporting Actress Oscar . She steals every scene she is in . Stack is almost just as good , amping up the melodrama , while still maintaining subtly and quiet desperation . Hudson and Bacall are a lot more restrained than those two , yet it is in keeping with the characters they play . So , what 's all this melodrama really about it ? Well , a lot of things . Stack 's powerful portrait of male inadequacy and fear , for one thing . Sirk surrounds Stack with phallic symbols throughout the film - note his tiny little gun , the oil derricks and the ultimate phallic symbol , Kyle 's seeming inability to conceive children . Stack seems to be suffering from a massive male superiority complex , made worse by his father 's preference for Hudson , his sister 's desire for Hudson , and his suspicion that his wife is carrying on with Hudson . With all this wealth Kyle Hadley still ends up at the wrong end of town , buying cheap corn liquor like a " bum " . It 's about impossible dreams , and having to let go of them . The river where Kyle , Marylee and Mitch used to play when they were kids is constantly referenced throughout the film , symbolising Kyle and ( especially ) Marylee 's wish for the innocence and simplicity of youth . In an excellent melodramatic scene , perfectly pulled off by Malone , Marylee 's stands by the river and imagines herself again as a child , with voice-over of Mitch telling Marylee that she will always be his girl . This is where Sirk strikes a huge emotional chord with the viewer . Who hasn't dreamed about going back to that special place in childhood ? Who hasn't , at some point , lived on a treasured memory ? Who hasn't wanted something they couldn't have ? And Hudson 's last line of the film ( yes , he gets no dialogue in the last 10 or so minutes , only close-ups ) recollects on how " far we 've come from the river , Marylee " . Amazing .  
  Another classic study of the effects of wealth on a southern family is masterfully depicted in Written on the Wind . Kyle Hadley has it all . Wealth , a plane , you name it . Kyle 's best friend , Mitch , has always gotten him out of difficulty . Mitch finished college , Kyle got thrown out . Mitch is not from a wealthy home . Kyle 's family , with Hadley Oil , controls most of everything in the town . While in N.Y. , Kyle meets the girl of his dreams , nicely played by Lauren Bacall . After a whirlwind romance , he marries her and brings her home . There she meets her father-in-law who warns her how difficult Kyle can be . Kyle sleeps with a gun under his pillow . The Bacall character meets Kyle 's sister , Mary Lee , a tramp if ever there were , played to the fullest by Dorothy Malone , who was voted best supporting actress . Rock Hudson plays Mitch , the faithful friend . A year of wedded bliss for Kyle and his bride ends when Kyle is told by the doctor that he can't have children . It is when his wife reveals to him that she is indeed pregnant , Kyle , thinking that the child is Mitch 's , goes on a drunken frenzy and is accidentally shot dead in a memorable scene . Mary Lee , who has always loved Mitch , tries but is unsuccessful in blaming Mitch for Kyle 's death . In a memorable courtroom scene , Malone pulled out all the stops in finally admitting that Kyle 's death was an unfortunate accident . Her Oscar was well deserved . Surprisingly , Robert Stack , brilliant as Kyle Hadley , was nominated for best supporting actor and lost in an upset victory by Anthony Quinn , as Paul Gauguin , in Lust for Life . Douglas Sirk was the master of soap opera films of the 1950s . Written on the Wind is no exception . * 1/2 .  
  Director Douglas Sirk once said ` there 's a very short distance between high art and trash , and trash that contains craziness is by this very quality nearer to art ' . This statement defines his cinema perfectly , a very unique body of work that includes classic stage adaptations , adventure and war films , westerns and of course , his famous melodramas . Sirk 's melodramas were , as the very word signifies , dramas with music . The music sets the tone for his masterful style , and every stroke of his brush ( Sirk was also a painter ) leaves a powerful image on the screen-turned-canvas . But this ain't life but its representation , an imitation of life . Sirk never tried to show reality , on the contrary . None of the directors of his generation made a better use of all the technical devices provided by Hollywood ( most notably Technicolor ) to distinguish the artificial from the real thing . Let 's remember that his golden period coincides with the time when Hollywood films turned its attention into the social drama ( Blackboard jungle , Rebel without a cause ) . Sirk always knew that cinema was meant to be something else . Another of Sirk 's statements summarizes this : ` You can't reach , or touch , the real . You just see reflections . If you try to grasp happiness itself your fingers only meet glass ' . I defy anybody that has seen Written on the wind to count the amount of mirrors and images reflected that appear on screen . One ends up giving up . Therefore , we are in a hall full of mirrors where there 's no difference between real and its false copy . Nobody can say that the Hadley are real people . That town ain't real either , with those hideous oil pumps all over the place . So in this realm the acting is affected , the decore is fake , the trick is visible . Everything is pushed a little bit off the limit ( the sexual connotations of Dorothy Malone with the oil tower , for example ) . Sirk was criticizing and theorizing at the same time . ` The angles are the director 's thoughts ; the lighting is his philosophy ' . In Written on the wind we follow the fall of a traditional way of life both in a geometrical way and in terms of light and shadows . The Hadleys house , with its different levels connected by the spiral staircase operates in a strictly metaphorical way . A house that resembles a mausoleum , that no party can cheer up . As tragedy progresses from luminous daylight to shadowy night , Sirk 's photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters , and so are the colours of the clothes they wear . Drama is thus incorporated to every element at the service of the director 's craft . Sirk considered himself a ` story bender ' , because he bended the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose . Written on the wind is a good example . It wouldn't work in any other hands . The other director that was using similar strategies was Frank Tashlin , who was for 50 's comedy the same that Sirk was for melodrama . Their films are full of the machinery of american life - advertising , TV sets , jukeboxes , washing machines , sport cars , vacuum cleaners - to depict its emptiness and decay . I 'm inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences . The game was played by both sides , so it was camp . Now we regard them as ` cult ' or ` bizarre ' , because we are not those spectators anymore . That is why Todd Haynes 's homage ` Far from heaven ' turns into a pastiche , because it reproduces Sirk 's work nowadays as if nothing happened in between . Then Sirk turns exactly into that painting hanging in the art gallery that Julianne Moore and the gardener discuss in the aforementioned film . Sirk understood the elements of melodrama perfectly . There were always immovable characters ( Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall here ) against which he could assemble a series of split ones . His balance through antithesis is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters , because these are the ones Sirk is interested in too . When Robert Stack flies the plane and ` tempts ' Lauren Bacall with all sorts of mundane comforts of the world below them ( obvious Faustian echoes ) we are strangely fascinated with him too , as we are when the devilish nymphomaniac little sister painfully evokes her past with Mitch alone by the river . In the Sirk 's universe the studio often-imposed ` happy ends ' have no negative impact . In fact they worked just great . Sirk was fond of greek tragedy and considered happy endings the Deux ex machinea of his day . Thus the final courtroom scene fits well and one must also remember that the whole film is told in flashback , so we know from the very beginning that tragedy will fall nevertheless over the Hadley feud . It was pointed out the many similarities between Written on the Wind with the Godfather saga . I absolutely agree and I 'm sure the parallel is not incidental . Both share the theme of the old powerful father head trying to keep his empire going while protecting his family . The temperamental son portrayed by Robert Stack has an amazing physical resemblance with Jimmy Caan 's Sonny Corleone . The action of fighting her sister 's male friend is symmetrical . The non-son in which the old man put his trust is also common in both films , as the fact that both families carry the names of their town . Even details as the gate that gives access to the property , and the surroundings of the house covered by leaves , suggest that Coppola had Written on the Wind in mind while setting his masterwork . Because both films deal with the subject of Power : the acquisition of power , its manipulation and legacy ( even Kyle Hadley 's sterility , the event that hastens the turmoil , is an issue easily tied to the central theme of Power , in this case , a weakness in sexual power ) . The other great film that deals with power and uses american life as its representation is Citizen Kane . One wouldn't think at first of similarities between Welles and Sirk 's films but there are a good many , starting with the petrol business as the origin of the family 's fortune and ending in the fact that Mitch Wayne ( Rock Hudson ) , as Charles Foster Kane , was adopted by a tutor , having his own father alive . Amazingly , the same actor ( Harry Shannon ) perform both Wayne and Kane 's fathers . This detail is cannot be a coincidence . Written on the Wind is a masterpiece in every aspect , in execution and vision , in style and technique , a highlight in the career of this wonderful director . Some say that this is his best film . In my opinion , ` Magnificent obsession ' , ` All that heaven allows ' , ` There 's always tomorrow ' and ` Imitation of life ' are just as good . And for those who put Sirk in the level of Dallas or Dinasty I wish them no happy end .  
  This is a film that everyone should watch . Quite apart from raising hugely important points ( while South Africa is on the road to recovery there are still many countries in similar situations now ) , it is superbly directed while Denzel Washington gives , in my opinion , the best performance in his career so far . Kline also gives a good performance , although perhaps not as stunning as Washington 's . John Thaw also puts in a good turn as the Chief of Police . There are so many possible areas where a film on apartheid could fall down , but all of these have been avoided . It would be easy to simply portray white people as the bad guys and black people as the good guys , but Attenborough has not done this . Sure , there were some white characters who seemed inherently evil , such as the Captain at the Soweto uprising , but to add extra dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearably long . Some people complain about the length of the film as it is , but I think it needs the whole two and a half hours to tell the whole story , for it really is an incredible one . The best scene in the film is that of Steve Biko 's funeral . When the whole crowd begins to sing the South African national anthem , it is probably one of , if not the most moving scenes I have seen . If you haven't seen this film already : watch it . It may not be comfortable viewing , but it 's certainly worth it .  
  this is indeed a treat for every Bolan fan , some might think that it 's a little over the top , and that it is only about Ringo and Marc 's egos , but i think it 's similar to any other concert video , except for the fact that this is Marc bolan , not just any guy ! i especially liked the music video for children of the revolution , with Elton John and Ringo Starr . this clip alone is worth all the money , i can't believe they did'not release this version as the single . The movie is really superb , especially for us danes . Now , I wasn't alive during the 70 's . but danes in general was totally shot out from what was happening around them . the media didn't play or show any of the popular music back then , including Marc Bolan and T.Rex , they only played a little with The Doors , only the really popular songs though . so , i know from my dad , that seeing this , gives him back a part of his youth , he never got to experience . i wont make this too long , so .. If you 're the least bit fan of Marc Bolan , you need to see this . you might find it boring or as said before , a little over the top . But at least you 've seen one of the best musicians ever , in action ! Only thing that disappoints me a little , is that Ride A White Swan isn't on the tape . but i forgive it , since Jeepster and Get It On are so wonderfully played .  
  This is one of the best animated movies I 've ever seen in my life . This isn't just a fun movie , or a well-made movie . This is a landmark in the art of animation and even if it weren't , just the technical skill that went into making it , would grant it a place in the history of animation . Wladyslaw Starewicz created a stop-motion movie about the secret life of beetles . He imagined a coherent world of insects , with jobs , houses , nightclubs , movie houses , even little props like posters and bicycles and paintings . In this movie he tells a simple tale of hypocrisy and revenge . Mr . Beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly , much to the chagrin of a grasshopper ; but he 's a cameraman and decides to shoot the fling . Mr . Beetle returns home and finds Mrs . Beetle having her own affair . Mr . Beetle chases the lover away but forgives his wife . The two make up and go out to the movies . And the movie they watch is Mr . Beetle and the Dragonfly . Described thus it sounds banal , but once seen it becomes a gripping work of cinema . Along with Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka , Wladyslaw Starewicz pretty much invented everything that future animators would use in their work . For that reason he must not remain forgotten .  
  Page 3 is most definitely a very enthralling and captivating eye-opener that very cleverly exposes the hypocrite lifestyles of Mumbai 's elite . From the fake kisses to the plastered smiles , Page 3 leaves no stone unturned in revealing the shocking lives of the rich and the famous . Backstabbing , gossip , corruption , and scandal lurk in every dark corner in the world of glitz and glam . Humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert in this world where Social Darwinism is the prevailing mentality . Everyone is constantly craving for more money , more fame , and a higher reputation , driving them to do the most shameful things imaginable ranging from signing film contracts at a funeral to child molestation . Anything is possible in this metropolis where there is a such a wide gap between the social classes . The audience sees the ugliness of both of these classes through the eyes of the protagonist . She observes the suffocating atmosphere and the mind-boggling frenzy that the socialites live in . Bollywood , business tycoons , politicians , and the underworld are all intertwined in a completely convoluted mess ! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a nice track as is the peppy Kuan Main Doob Jaongi . Terrific film with excellent character development !  
  The plot of this enjoyable MGM musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing , dealing with espionage and romance but the focus of the film is properly pointed upon the tuneful interludes showcasing the enormously talented and athletic tap dancing Eleanor Powell , abetted by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra , featuring Ziggy Elman , Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra . Red Skelton shares top billing with Powell , and he and sidekick Bert Lahr are given most of the comedic minutes , although Skelton is more effective when he , if it can be believed , performs as Powell 's love interest , with Virginia O'Brien actually providing most of the film 's humor as the dancer 's companion . The technical brilliance of Powell is evidenced during one incredible scene within which Buddy Rich contributes his drumming skills , and which must be viewed several times in order to permit one 's breathing to catch up with her precision . Director Edward Buzzell utilizes his large cast well to move the action nicely along despite the rather disjointed script with which he must deal , and permits Powell 's cotangent impossibilities to rule the affair , as is appropriate .  
  Freddy Krueger the dream stalker from elm street returns , the great character actor Robert englund is back in this sequel of nightmare 5 , dream child . i hope i got the number correctly . there 's been so many , and this one is one of the best , especially for the cameos by ; Rosanne Barr ( then Arnold ) tom Arnold , johnny depp , ( who did the very first nightmare in 84 ) alice cooper ( singer ) you will see Freddy as a tormented child , a teenager who loves pain , and as a family guy ( creepy ) the effects are very funny and creative , the cast also includes Lisa Zane ( Billy 's sister ) breckin Meyer ( road trip ) yaphet kotto ( alien , live and let die ) and Amanda Donahue ( father knows best ) i was one of the people 3who saw this in 3d , well the ending . i love 3d movies . i missed the first 3d wave in 1953 ( i wasn't even born yet ) the second wave was in 1983 . i like all the Freddy movies . this one stands out as one of the better ones not counting the first which was absolutely brilliant , Freddy became the new monster of the 80s and 90s , along with Jason voorhees , chucky , Micheal myers , and leather face . can you imagine a film with all of them ? i recommend this to all Freddy fans and horror fans alike . that Freddy is such a cut up . 8 out of 10 .  
  First of all , I loved Bruce Broughton 's music score , very lyrical , and this alone added to the film 's charm . The best aspect of the movie were the three animals , superlatively voiced by Michael J.Fox , Sally Field and the late Don Ameche . Whereas Fox has the funniest lines , Ameche plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging character ( the voice of reason ) , and Field adds wit into a character that is always seen telling Chance off . The humans weren't as engaging , and sometimes the film dragged , but that is my only complaint . This is one beautiful-looking film , with beautiful close up shots of Canada , I believe . Although the film itself is quite long , there is never a seriously dull moment , and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well-written script . All in all , a charming and perhaps underrated film , with a 9/10 from me . Bethany Cox .  
  Throughout this film , you might think this film is just for kids . Well , it is mainly pointed towards them , but it 's also well-rounded enough with the jokes pointed also at the adults in the audience . This time around , the Muppet gang try to get on Broadway , with the dire straits keeping them from getting it produced , leading them to splitting up . But Kermit won't stop , and his determination keeps things moving along until after getting the deal together he gets hit by a car and sent into amnesia ! It 's a send-up , in part , of those old starring vehicles from the 40s with musicals actually as the topic of a musical , only here there 's the usual lot of zaniness and wonderful moments thrown into a pot of hysterically funny moments ( Lou Zealand 's boomerang fish ; Gonzo 's water-stunt display , the whisper campaign , among many others ) , but also with a lot of heart too . The Muppet writers aren't shy of the conventions , on the contrary , they embrace them to the point where it 's almost refreshing to see such a ' lets put on a show ' story where through thick and think the characters will meet their dream . While not as totally original in scope as the Muppet Movie , it 's got many catchy and memorable songs , excellent locations all over Manhattan , and even some intonations of inter-species dating ( and marriage ) ! Cameos include Liza Minneli ( " a frog ? " ) , Elliot Gould ( as the cop ) , Brooke Shields ( propositioned by a rat ) , Edward I . Koch , Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers . So get ready to sing-along , or just have a lot of big laughs and romantic ( yes romantic ) times with one of the best Muppet movies .  
  I have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say . Even though this movie did not get the best comments , this movie made my day . It got me thinking . What a false world this is . What do you do when your most loved ones deceive you . It 's said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake , it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance . Same way some people are such that they are never grateful . This movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself . A brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster . The surviving brother decides to take revenge . Through this process , we learn about the futility of this world . Nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone . Amitabh gave the performance of his life . The new actor Aryan gave a good performance . The actress who played the wife of Amitabh stole the show . Her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance . Chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herself . A great movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi . His movies always give some message to the audience . His movies are like novels of Nanak Singh ( a Punjabi novelist who 's novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil ) because they have a real message for the audience . They are entertaining as well as lesson-giving .  
  Peter Jacksons version ( s ) are better films overall from objective point of view . That being said , they are not my favorite screen versions of Lord Of The Rings , and let me explain why . Firstly , the acting of the on-screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with Jackson 's LOTR . The whole cast is too run of the mill . " Are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of Ralph Bakshi version are better actors than real people ? " one could ask . Well , they are not really silly ( save for Hobbits , later about them ) and they certainly pack more personality than Jackson 's party - even with much more limited dialogue time . And that is because of superior _ voice _ acting of the Bakshi 's LOTR . Take Aragorn for example . In this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authority ( Aragorn the lord ) and with a seasoned rasp ( Aragorn the ranger ) . This is due to John Hurt 's brilliant voice acting . Compare that to Viggo Mortensen 's rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven : Hurt beats Mortensen hands down . And then there is Gandalf . Probably the most dominating ( and the most popular ) character in the whole saga . In this Bakshi version Gandalf ( William Squire ) is a real wizard . And by that I don't mean he shoots bolts from his fingertips ( he does not ) , but his presence is just captivating . He is a mystical , powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease . Add to that his looks : Tall , old as the ancient oak , beard long as his body , sharp eyes , wizardy hook nose and of course , the classical wizard hat . A Perfect Gandalf , just like in the books . Ian McKellen 's Gandalf in the other hand , is simply just too boring . He looks too human , sounds too human , acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword . Yes a sword . In this Bakshi version Gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his sword ( as he did in the books ) . And those are stylish slow motion kills . Gandalf is not a power to be messed with . And it must be noted , that while I 'm sad to say this , the great Christopher Lee didn't bring Saruman alive . Fraser Kerr in this movie did , even with a very limited screen time and lines . Before I move completely to visual aspects of the movie , it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the Orcs are also superior to Jackson 's pretendeous bad guys . Bakshi 's orcs taunt their enemies ( or each other ) constantly with growls , screams and nasty language . They are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion . And finally , the Black Riders - or the Nazgul . Those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one - not just some riders wearing black . And they speak with haunting voice , which mesmerizes their victim . My favorite scene in the film is when the Nazgul are chasing Frodo near the river . While Peter Jackson couldn't do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party , Bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering sky . But as much I like this film more than Jackson 's , the latter are , if only technically , still better . And that is because of some key visuals . As you know Bakshi LOTR features a mixture of animated characters ( all hobbits and the main cast ) and real actors covered with paint . I don't really have a problem using real people in animation this way , but they just don't fit very well with traditional cartoon figures . This is especially true with humans ( Riders of Rohan , tavern people etc . ) Orcs are different matter , since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters . Orcs , while played by humans with animation mix , look far superior to Jacksons version . They have brownish-green skin , shiny red eyes , flat face and pointed teeth . Biggest screw up in this films visuals , howerver , are the Hobbits . While I prefer almost every character in Bakshi version compared to Jackson , the latter has clearly superior Hobbits , in fact they are perfect . With Bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid Disney bambies . And you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them , so be warned . Again , the voice acting is OK with them too , but the actors mouths cannot save the " immersion damage " made by these little weasels . Well , I never really liked those halflings anyway . General failures in the Bakshi script are well known . Limited playing time ( with limited budget ) and a lot of missing scenes . So while this film covers nearly half of the story , it doesn't do it in extensive detail compared to Jackson 's version . In a summary the Ralph Bakshi version of LOTR has a superior : - overall atmosphere ( it feels more like Middle-Earth ) - overall voice acting - music ( I really dig the fantasy score by Kont & Rosenman ) - Gandalf - Aragorn ( One of the John Hurt 's finest roles ) - King Theoden - Orcs - Black Riders - Elrond ( He 's not some fairy hippie in this one ! ) While Jackson version is better : - because it covers the whole story - overall visuals and special effects - Gollum / Smeagol - Balrog - Hobbits Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi , even with it 's well known shortcomings , is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of Tolkien 's fantasy world very well , if not perfectly . I 'll give it a score of 8½ out of 10 .  
  As an animated film from 1978 , this is pretty good-generally well above the standard of the days when Disney hadn't done anything good in years ( and Tolkien cared little for Disney anyway ) . It gets major points for innovative and careful camera work , applying cinematic techniques with relative success . The much-maligned rotoscoping actually works pretty well , especially with the Ringwraiths , and the opening narration . However , it is so drastically overused-possibly as a money-saving technique-that it detracts from the overall effect . The same technique that makes wraiths spooky and otherworldly doesn't fare so well in the Prancing Pony . As for the adaptation of the story , it 's actually quite good . We lose little bits here and there , minor details such as the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil , the Gaffer and the Sackville-Bagginses . We compress a few characters , such as revising Legolas as one of Elrond 's household and an old friend of Aragorn 's , but that 's a rather wise decision for film . In books you have room to include the references to the larger world of the Elves and Middle-Earth 's vast history . In film , you trade that for visuals and sound that convey the same elements in a different way . Nothing critical is truly lost here , and although I have minor quibbles about some of the changes , I 'm generally pretty happy with it . If only the dratted writers had managed to remember Saruman 's name-he 's frequently referred to as Aruman , a decision probably made to make him more distinct from similarly-named Sauron ; it took me a second viewing before I was certain I hadn't misheard it . It 's also annoying that Boromir is a bloody stage viking , and irritable from the start . However , Gandalf is excellent , and most of the rest of the voicework is excellent . If only John Hurt weren't too old to play Aragorn ; I love his voice . Of course , with the film ending at the midpoint of the story , there 's a vast disappointment built in . What makes it far , far worse is the altogether miserable job done by the Rankin & Bass crew on the sequel . That they were permitted to do Return of the King after butchering The Hobbit remains a huge mystery ; they seem more interested in bad songs than in proper storytelling . For all its faults , this film 's heart is solidly in place and it tries very hard to accomplish a nearly impossible task . I can only hope that the upcoming series of films keeps as true to its vision ..  
  Things to Come is an historic film . Along with Metropolis ( 1927 ) , it stands as one of the first great science fiction spectacles . It is also one of the first doomsday movies . It is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the Second World War within a year , and even , in a subtle way , the year it would end in the real world . But then the film departs from reality , depicting a world ravaged by war ( only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in 1936 ) . The last half hour of the film is an incredible sight , making groundbreaking use of models and matte paintings - later to become staples of the science fiction genre . It is sad that , after Things to Come , Sci-fi would become identified with cheaply made b-movies , a stereotype that wouldn't be broken until 2001 : A Space Odyssey more than 30 years later . If they 'd stuck with the quality of the effects in this film , things would have been very different in Hollywood . Raymond Massey and some of his co-stars play multiple roles in this film , to good effect . Massey plays a great " Doctor Who " - like role as a pilot from an advanced ( for 1970 ) civilization who tries to win over the populace of a devastated country ruled by a simple-minded warlord ( a very effective performance by Ralph Richardson ) . Ultimately , the storyline covers 100 years . But that 's a big problem with this film - there really isn't a cohesive storyline . Perhaps in such an episodic film - somewhat reminiscent of Intolerance , actually - it 's hard to have a conventional plot , but I felt more could have been made of the material , and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission .. the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting . Maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci-fi innovation : a sequel ? Things to Come is a film every serious sci-fi buff should see at least once . Unlike Metropolis , however , it might not bear repeated viewings .  
  I first saw this film 40 years ago on N.Y. television , and thought it was a depressing look at the future . Wells sees restriction of private freedoms as a good thing . ( " no private airplanes " . The 30 year plus war in the film was the reason this film was not shown to British film goers doing the war . The concept of the future , and the Korda an Co . concept of the the machines of the future are the real stars of the film . The very best acting performance is that of Ralph Richardson as the Boss . A combination of Winston Churchill and Edina from Absolutely Fabulous comedy series . It is interesting to note that the Boss 's negative personality is somewhat similar to the war time Churchill .  
  I first saw this movie when it came out in 1994 and just watched it recently and it is STILL funny . I don't know if you have to understand hiphop in the 90 's , but it helps if you do . In the 90 's when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top , there were internal strife within the groups and members when their separated ways ( Ice Cube , Easy E , etc ) . Also there were the wanna b 's , accessible rappers that start making the scene ( Vanilla Ice , Freedom Williams from C & C Music Factory , etc ) . This movie makes fun of all of that in a way that seems like it 's an actually documentary . Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer that spends a year in the life of a fictitious rap group name N.W.H. The members of the group are Ice Code ( Rusty Condieff / director ) , Tasty Taste ( Larry B Scott / Revenge of the Nerds , and Tone Def ( Mark Christopher Lawrence ) . They are an up and coming rap group whose politics makes them controversial . Whats good about this film is that it is so thourough in its portrayal of the hiphop industry of the 80s and they way it pokes fun at it . But , if you know 80 's / 90 's rap , you know how much of this stuff is true . Still , on it 's own , without hip hop knowledge , it is still a funny funny movie . And for all of those who ask , yes Spinal Tap came first , but Spinal Tap is not the first spoof movie either . This , in my opinion is equally as funny and in some ways , better than Spinal Tap . As Spinal Tap is to heavy metal , Fear of A Black Planet is to Rap . And the songs are off the hook also . The DVD is chalk full of extras to include music videos of NWH as a group and as solo artists . Brilliant performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott .  
  I love the Satan Pit ! David Tennant is such a great actor and so is Billie Piper ! Who else loves Will Thorp to pieces ? He is so cute , isn't he ? I hated the bits where he got possessed by the devil and where he got told to " go to hell " , as Rose so bluntly put it . Mind you , he was quite funny when he said , " Rose , do us a favour , will you ? Shut up ! " . Mr Jefferson was so brave , wasn't he ? Dying to save the others . I felt really sorry for Toby ( Will Thorp ) when he came out of the possession for the 2nd time because he was so scared . I was like " Oh my god if I was Rose I 'd be so scared for him " . And when she hugged him I was like " grr , he 's mine ! hands off ! " but I thought that was really sweet . And the doctor .. well , I thought he was gonna say to Ida " tell Rose I love her " but he didn't . Oh well .  
  Despite the feelings of most " Star Wars " fans , in my opinion " Return Of The Jedi " is the greatest cinematic film ever created . Ever since the first time I saw it , it 's depth , intensity , special effects , and moving story have overwhelmed me . The film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years . Filled with powerful action , as the climax of the original trilogy , George Lucas gives us a rousing finish of the " Star Wars " saga in " Jedi " . Film Summary ( Contains Spoilers For Those Who Have Not Seen It ) After " The Empire Strikes Back " left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in " Return Of The Jedi " . Darth Vader , in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted Death Star to oversee it 's construction . The Emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the Rebel Alliance and bring young Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side . Luke , Lando , Leia , Chewie , and the droids all travel to Tatooine to rescue the frozen Han Solo from the crime Lord ; Jabba The Hutt . After Han has been rescued , and Jabba defeated , Luke returns to Dagobah to find a dying Yoda where he learns the awful truth ; Darth Vader is in fact his father . The rebel heroes regroup with the Rebel Fleet . Now joined by other species and races including the Mon Calamari the Rebels must make a all-or-nothing plan of attack to destroy the Death Star before it is completed . While Lando heads the space attack in the Millennium Falcon , the Rebel heroes must disable the Death Star 's shield generator on the Forest Moon Of Endor . It is here that the Rebels happen upon the furry , but mighty Ewoks . During the the two part intense battle , a third battle must take place as Luke willingly delivers himself to Vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the Dark Side . In emotionally charged sequences Luke must face his father as the Emperor lures out his dark emotions . As young Skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of Palpatine , Vader turns on his wicked master to save his son 's life . Filled with a deep timeless story of good vs . evil , " Return Of The Jedi " is a spectacular , emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us .  
  Clint Eastwood has definitely produced better movies than this , but this one does not embarrass him . Dirty Harry catches everyone 's attention and unless one wants to watch romance , there is no reason why you won't like him . He is cool because he is dirty , is great because he kills without much thinking , is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he doesn't care . From what I have seen in movies in which Eastwood acts , the character of the lead role always captivates the audience . In White Hunter Black heart , he is the crazy director , in " in the Line of Fire " he is the " Old ' un " while here is the " almost " jobless with his job , that is to say he makes work for himself , doesn't care one damn about his superiors who practically send him out for a vacation . Based on a rape victim , this movie is promising for all the " no non-sense " movie watchers . The movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot . However , what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of Eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not , as it is far too obvious from the beginning . It is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving . Also , there are too many people far dirtier than Dirty harry .  
  With this movie being the only Dirty Harry movie which Clint Eastwood not only stars , but produces and directs as well , you know it 's got to be good . Although some say that The Enforcer is the best out of the series , I completely disagree . In my opinion , apart from the original Dirty Harry , Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only two worthy of being in the series . Although The Enforcer is an alright film with a couple of good action sequences , it doesn't get the dirty and gritty impact that the other three films do . This film captures all the excitement that makes a Clint Eastwood film good , and it 's got the quotes that make a Dirty Harry film good . In Diry Harry it 's " .. Well do ya , punk ? " ; in Magnum Force " A man 's got to know his limitations " ; and in this it 's " Go ahead . Make my day . " Also in this film it 's nice to see a change of scenery , as you get a bit tired of seeing the same old San Fransisco streets in the other films in the series . With great acting by Clint Eastwood and co-star Sandra Locke , and good directing by Clint , this is in my opinion the best Dirty Harry sequel ever .  
  This film takes place in the 1950s . According to this the dead ( called zombies ) have arisen to eat the living . However a company has developed a collar that , when put around the zombies neck , makes them docile and perfect servants . The Robinsons mom Helen ( Carrie-Anne Moss ) , dad Bill ( Dylan Baker ) and son Timmy ( K'Sun Ray ) hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one . Tim names the zombie Fido ( Billy Connolly ) and becomes friends with him . But his dad hates him and Timmy looses control of Fido and things go wrong . As you can see this is-among many other things-a takeoff on the " Lassie " series with Fido being a stand in for Lassie . Timmy was named that for a reason ! Every single of the famous Lassie episodes are spun here . My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido off to get help before the zombies eat him ! Also it 's a satire of those 1950s Douglas Sirk films where everything is bright and colorful-but dark secrets are tearing people apart . The characters wear VERY bright 1950s clothes ( Moss is always in a dress ) - the furnishings , settings and cars especially are all 1950s in hyper bright colors . Even when the script becomes repetitious there 's always something to look at . The script is good-but there are only so many Lassie jokes you can make . The melodramatics are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off . Everyone here is excellent and right on target . Even Connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job . Moss is the best-playing each line for all its worth-but never going overboard . This isn't for everybody ( of course ) . The satire may be lost on most people and the gore is pretty tame . The gore is done so casually and with happy music playing over it it 's hard to take it seriously . So , for some people , this will really work . I give it an 8 .  
  And this somebody is me . And not only me , as I can see here at IMDb or when leaving the theater . Why did the people love it ? It 's obvious : Everybody knows zombies by now ( at least the Horror fans by heart and the others through the " Dawn of the Dead " reinvention or Resident Evil movies etc . ) Or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies .. that is until this movie came along . And you 'll see zombies in a new light ( perhaps ) . This is not a horror movie , although it does contain some violent scenes , but is rather a comedy . A satire to be precise . And it never runs out of steam ! That is why I rated it so high . Pacing wise it 's incredible , the acting is great and the script has no ( obvious ) mistakes .. quite the contrary : It 's a gem and if you 're only a little bit interested in zombies you ought to see it ! And even if you dislike them , watch it ! Because it 's a great ( comedy ) movie !  
  This Movie has great fight scenes . Now its true that the acting is a little rough . But If I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills I would watch a Cheesy movie Like American Beauty . But If you want to see a movie with true martial arts in it and with Amazing stunts WITHOUT the use of wires and flying threw the air like so many movies around now which are over killing the matrix . Then Watch this . Now it 's true the two main stars in the show where in the kid show the power rangers and another cast member of that show has a bit part in this movie . But hey the fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li p * s his pants . And the stunts are worthy enough for Jackie Chan to sit threw and admire .  
  Guns blasting , buildings exploding , cars crashing , and that 's just the first ten minutes . This action-packed film involving a rogue ex-CIA mercenary who can't seem to die no matter how many times he 's shot ( hence the title ) is pretty decent . Tough and toothy Gary Busey , usually cast as a villain in these kinda flicks , has his usual crazy charm but is a bit more subdued : after all he 's carrying the entire show . Which doesn't mean there isn't a lot of terrific supporting roles including William Smith , Luke Askew , Mills Watson , R.G. Armstrong , Henry Silva , Lincoln Kirkpatrick , Thalmus Rasulala , and several other " forgotten " character-actors . There 's enough smaller action sequences to hold up the entire story : Busey has to free a group of " kidnapped " American military elites and return a high-tech " supertank " ( a normal tank with a cheesy add-on pasted to the top ) back to the States . But does America deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys ? This question is asked , of course , like in any film centering on the CIA .. but without getting preachy .  
  I caught this film late on a sat night / Sunday morning with my brother . We had been drinking . This is one of the best films for ripping apart I have ever seen . From the ' luxury ' ocean liner actually being a ' roll on , roll off ' ferry , complete with cast iron everything to the doors with adhesive stickers saying staff , then seeing the same door being used for something else in another scene - this film rocks ! The continuity is so poor you cant help but notice it , it slaps you in the face with the holes . In the final scene he jumps off a life boat with the ferry in the distance . Cut to his son and new girlfriend ( The ships PR director who knows kung-fu and used to be in the police but was dismissed for doing things her way - true ) on the ferry going very fast away from the explosion . .. Then the dad is there hugging them . HoW ? Who cares , its magic . There is not one redeeming feature to this film . The casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table . when being chased by the villains there is only One place to hide , you 've guessed it . Enter the villains who , instead of checking under the One table , proceed to shoot up four fruit machines and a little corner bar ( a corner bar in the casino - fantastic ) . They walk straight past the only hiding place thus allowing our Casper to get around them and ' take them out ' . Get some mates over , get a few drinks in , put this film on and howl .  
  I.Q. , in my opinion , is a sweet , charming , and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you . If you ask me , James ( Stephen Fry ) really was a dull guy . To me , Ed ( Tim Robbins ) was more suited for Catherine ( Meg Ryan ) than James was . Anyway , everyone involved in this film did an absolutely outstanding job . Now , in conclusion , I highly recommend this sweet , charming , and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you to any Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan fan who hasn't seen it . You 're in for lots of laughter , so go to the video store , rent it or buy it , kick back with a friend , and watch it .  
  Dark comedy ? Gallows humor ? How does one make a comedy out of murder ? It can be risky business as the viewer is required to let go of their moral values and laugh at the antics of a man who kills people . So , the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality in order to make it work . So , Pierce Brosnan , the Irishman 's answer to 007 is now cast as a chain-smoking , sex-addicted alcoholic who kills people for a living and is having a life crisis . He meets a struggling businessman , Greg Kinnear , and after a rocky beginning , he learns that he needs a friend . But , Greg 's happily married to Hope Davis and Brosnan sees in him the basic things he doesn't have , love , home and a life . Add character actor , Philip Baker Hall as the hit-man 's manager and we 're off to the races . Brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the anti-hero and Kinnear delightful as his counterpart , the very human businessman . Hope Davis adds a sparkle as Kinnear 's very conventional wife who is fascinated with this derelict who drifts into their lives . The ending is delightful and with some surprise to it . You should leave the theater feeling , at least , partly good - if you 're able to suspend being aghast at killing people .  
  Robot Jox tries hard , but is fundamentally a series of fight scenes strung together - robot against robot , man against man , man against woman . The premise had potential , but it seems the script wasn't really given the couple of more drafts it needed . Still , it was fairly good , for a science fiction action movie . Part of it was because the script was by Joe Haldeman . For those who aren't familiar with the name , Haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel " The Forever War . " It 's considered one of the very best powered battle armor novels , right up there with Robert Heinlein 's " Starship Troopers " and John Steakley 's " Armor . " And this movie is really more like a giant powered battle armor movie , rather than giant robots . It 's closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the travesty that was Paul Verhoeven 's " Starship Troopers , " which bore only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based on . Despite some assumptions , this really isn't based on Homer 's " Iliad . " A couple of names are all they had in common . Achilles having his robot 's foot blown off had no parallel in the Iliad , which didn't include Achilles ' death . Nor was the ancient Achilles a noble warrior . He was the mightiest , but also vengeful and petty . Even the robot jock killed off in the first scene doesn't fit . He was named Hercules , while the Greek Iliad would have had Herakles . The effects were fairly good for the time and the budget . True , it wasn't comparable to " Terminator 2 " a year later , but that movie cost ten times as much . The stop motion was almost as good as the robotic walkers in " The Empire Strikes Back " and " Return of the Jedi . " Better , in fact , than a lot of Ray Harryhausen animation , which is highly regarded , but quite dated . Don't bring high expectations into this and you probably won't be disappointed . It 's better than a lot of other low-budget flicks and even some big-budget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects but far worse scripts .  
  * SPOILERS * * SPOILERS * This is without a doubt the best film Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever made and even with the marvelous script the film is enhanced by a great performance by Hanna Schygulla . Film starts out with Maria ( Schygulla ) and Hermann Braun ( Klaus Lowitsch ) just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is shipped out towards the waning days of the war and now Maria and her mother and sister must scrape by to survive . Maria decides to get a job as a dancer / prostitute in a club that caters to American GI 's and she meets a black Army soldier named Bill ( Greg Eagles ) and they start to see one another on a steady basis . Maria hears that her husband Hermann has died in the war so she gets very serious with Bill . But one day while getting intimate with Bill they see Hermann at the door . He hasn't died and when he enters the room a scuffle occurs and Maria breaks a bottle over Bill 's head and he dies . Hermann takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long term in jail so Maria tells him that she will succeed at something and get him out . The war has ended and Germany must rebuild and one day on a train Maria meets Karl Oswald ( Ivan Desny ) who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charms to get a job . Maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes Karl 's mistress . She tells him that she will never marry him but he is in love with her . Hermann gets out of jail but goes to Canada to try and get over everything that Maria has done since he has been locked up . * SPOILER ALERT * One day Karl dies and leaves Maria just about everything in his will and Maria buys her own house . Then Hermann finally comes home to his wife and they are both ready to start they 're marriage even though they have been married for some time now . But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it . There are so many interesting things in this film that its one of those movies that can be studied and talked about to great lengths . Like in all Fassbinder films the use of color is used in a very interesting way . As the film begins the tones are brown and gray to represent war torn Germany but as Maria starts to become successful they change to bright rich colors like red and white . The rebuilding of Germany with all the sounds of construction are used as only backdrop and the film stays focused on the exploits of Maria . Fassbinder did want the sounds of rebuilding to remind us of what was going on in Germany at that time . Hanna Schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film . With a lesser actress this would have been just another interesting film but Schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this film to an elite status . Schygulla shows Maria as very determined and smart but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants . She 's not embarrassed nor does she feel guilty about this and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive . Schygulla wasn't nominated for an Academy Award but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time . Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother Lilo Pempeit plays Frau Ehmke . I have heard many things about the ending of the film and it has to do with whether Maria purposely left the gas on . Later in the bathroom she is running water over her wrist and she appears to be sad . This is only speculation and if you think I 'm wrong please e-mail me . I think she was overly excited by Hermann being home and left it on by accident ( Remember her putting on a dress for no reason ? ) . Then when the will is being read to her its at that point that she learns that Hermann and Karl had become friendly without her knowledge and I think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing . Thats the reason for the bathroom scene . So when the house explodes its by accident . But I think the reason for Fassbinder having an ending like that is to show that anyone who would sell their soul has no business living . Fassbinder was fascinated by survivors but he was also incredibly passionate . In his view Maria can't have it both ways . A fascinating film .  
  " It wasn't me ! It was , er , my twin brother Rupert ! " Bobby says to Dugan when confronted about being over at Sally 's place . I have used this line dozens of times over the years ( no one has yet to believe it , though ) . This movie is one of the all-time best for sheer fun and nonbelieveability . Steven Oliver was perfect for the part of Dugan , so much so that he was in 1978 's " Malibu Beach " as the same character ( not nearly as much screen time , though ) . " Nobody calls Dugan a turd ! " is another line for the ages . This classic film was definitely worth the price of admission .  
  A good film , and one I 'll watch a number of times . Rich ( the previous commenter ) is right : there is much more going on here than is clear from the title boards , and I have to wonder how much has suffered in translation . Were there more in the original ? Or was a native-language audience expected to lip-read more ? Or - since the screenplay was written by the author of the novel on which this was based - was this a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar ? In short , very worth a look , but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original 1913 audience had to put into it . The Alpha Video release touts the new organ score , but the music is not matched to the story progression in any way . Sure , it starts promisingly , but degenerates into a repetitive , Phillip-Glass-like monotony that reflects nothing of the action on the screen . After listening for a while , I turned off the sound and simply watched : much better !  
  Wasn't sure what to expect from this film . I love watching Brosnan in any movie , he 's always good , but this was totally different . He 's a mess , and plays being a mess very well . In fact he reminded me of myself a few times back in uni : ) So yes , there 's not a lot of violence , there 's not a lot of action , but the dialogue is cracking , the acting is superb and very refreshing , and it 's pretty funny too : ) I don't think you 'll come out of the cinema going " Wow ! I was blown away " , but you 'll come out smiling having enjoyed a good film . Can't ask for more than that . Oh , and if you 're lucky , some moron will put the adverts reel in wrong and you 'll get inverted , upside down , reversed ( with reversed audio ) adverts ! Brilliant . Nothing like watching a Jack Daniels ad where the drink goes back into the bottle from the glass with a gruff American " Twin Peaks " commentary : )  
  Josef Von Sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about silent Hollywood and the former Imperial General to the Czar of Russia who has found himself there . Emil Jannings won a well-deserved Oscar , in part , for his role as the general who ironically is cast in a bit part in a silent picture as a Russian general . The movie flashes back to his days in Russia leading up to the country 's fall to revolutionaries . William Powell makes his big screen debut as the Hollywood director who casts Jannings in his film . The film serves as an interesting look at the fall of Russia and at an imitation of behind-the-scenes Tinseltown in the early days . Von Sternberg delivers yet another classic , and one that is filled with the great elements of romance , intrigue , and tragedy .  
  I liked this movie because it basically did more with less . It could have been made more interesting if they had kept it confined to the studio even more ( though some of the plot elements would have been harder to develop ) . The guy playing the DJ did a good job of showing someone spooked out and haunted by his memories . I also found his dialog with the callers pretty funny . While parts of the movie you can see coming a mile away , other parts you do not expect to turn out the way they did . I thought it was a pretty minimal ghost story for the most part , concentrating more on the living side of the equation . The last 5-10 minutes were pretty well done as everything is being revealed . While it was a shorter movie , it felt to be just about the right amount of time to tell the story . Any more and it would have started to drag .  
  I just have to throw my two cents in . Relax , it 's a comedy . Yes for the most part the characters are broadly written and acted . I can't think of many comedies where they aren't . This isn't a new release , it 's out on video and airs on cable almost every week . Would I see it in a theater ? Sure , I did , when it first came out . It 's funny .. that should be enough . Even if I didn't like it at all I 'd still watch it on cable for Michael Keaton . He 's an underrated and under-appreciated actor . I can't think of another who is so capable in every genre . Nor can I think of one who 's as successful . A comedic actor who 's also an action star ( short lived but still ) , who 's also a romantic lead , who 's also a dramatic actor ; a villain and a hero . I can't think of any , at least not in Hollywood . Certainly none who have been successful at all those genres . I mean there 's Tom Cruise but to me he 's better at being Tom Cruise than becoming a character . However this isn't about Michael Keaton vs . Tom Cruise so I 'll move on . Gung Ho is worth renting , heck it 's worth buying since you can probably find it for $ 10.00 or less at stores like Wal-Mart . It 's worth watching on cable ( if you have cable or satellite ) . It 's one of those fun to watch movies . You can put your brain on pause , and just relax , and chuckle away . To ask for more , in my honest opinion , is asking too much .  
  I have always had the philosophy that every single human being has different tastes , i found this movie to be awesome and i think every college student out there might agree with me . Notwithstanding this is not a " movie with a plot " , its about real guys and some of the " problems " that they face . I found the movie hilarious ( especially the parts that they played the practical jokes on each other ) . Simply put , if you are in the same " wave-length " as these people , you will find this movie amazing . I don't think that this is going win any Golden Globes or Oscars , or that the people in this movie will become future Hollywood stars , but its a kind of " cult-classic " among young people who could relate to their experience . For me the guy that stands out the most is Hans : the Scandinavian guy , who , according to him " isnt a looker " , but gets all ( or some ) of the chicks . The " little-people " also play a big part in the movie , especially when they are drunk . If i keep going , i might provide a spoiler and i don't want to do that , just go and get the movie and you will not regret . I give it a 8/10  
  THE MATADOR is hit-man movie lite .. if you can say that about a hit-man movie . The violence is never really shown but often introduced . At first I was scared I was in for another retread of mid-90s gangster hit man hipster dark comedy BUT was happily surprised when I realized this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship . Nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me grinning . The three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together . The writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes . This is a good film that I probably won't remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy . Good film .  
  This film is one of the finest American B-movies of the 90s . If you 're looking for a serious film , look elsewhere . However , if you 're looking for some action , a lot of laughs , and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters , this is well worth watching . Everyone chews the scenery a bit , but that 's really what the film is all about , and everyone is quite funny . Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together .  
  The Sentinel features a sort of run of the mill and clichéd suspense / mystery but is lifted with some good acting and taut pacing . These stories have already for the most part gone through as many permutations as we can bear , so what we 're left with is how good is the acting , how smart are the setups and bad guys , how well crafted is the main plot etc etc .. so the Sentinel does a solid job given it 's content . Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland both maintain some good screen bravado and attitudes . Eva Longoria ( first time I 've seen her on screen ) brings some satisfactory support . The whole affair side of the story is utterly implausible knocking it down a bit , but it deserves slack . Worth a viewing if you like the genre .  
  Frankie Dio ( Lee VanCleef ) is a high-ranking mobster who turns himself in to the police or illegal gambling ( for reasons that seem unclear to me ) . Tony ( Tony Lo Bianco ) is a low-level thug who frequents a pool hall and spends his free time envying Frankie . By being in the right place at the right time , Tony gets arrested with Frankie and is sent to jail .. where they form a bond that may not quite be friendship , but it will do for now . This film came to me under the title of " Frank and Tony " , which is disappointing because I see an alternate name is " Mean Frank and Crazy Tony " , which would have helped sell the film more effectively . I presume that 's an homage to " Dirty Mary , Crazy Larry " but what do I know ? I watched it shortly after another Italian crime film , " Violent Professionals " , and I must say the two complement each other very well . Italians have always lagged behind Americans in their budgets and production values , which is a real shame with this film . It is considered a " grindhouse " film , which unfairly demotes it to a b-movie ( or worse ) . With a cleaner sound and picture , this could have been a Hollywood hit , I suspect . I found the story very interesting , the characters ( and actors ) better than average and unlike " Violent Professionals " the plot is fairly clear - not too many secondary characters . If you like Mafia movies or crime films you should give this one a try . A film about the mob that 's actually from Italy ( how much more authentic do you want ? ) is as much as you can ask . Sure , it 's not " The Godfather " , but it 's not supposed to be . This isn't a drama , it 's a light comedy , heavy action buddy film .. like " Die Hard With a Vengeance " from the point of view of the bad guys . Well , okay , not really . If nothing else , this film made me want to check out other films from the director and the principle cast . Films besides " Escape From New York " ( where VanCleef plays " Hauk " ) and the usual cult movies . What 's more fun than discovering a lost classic ?  
  Tom the cat , Jerry the mouse , and Spike the Dog ( here called Butch , his third name , his second being ' Killer ' ) decide to sign a peace treaty to all love each other . It 's weird and a bit unnatural seeing them all buddy buddy like this and their friend 's seem to think so too . But by the end thanks to a disagreement over a steak , everything is back to normal and all is how it should be . This short is the second one of three on the new Spotlight DVD to be edited and I have no clue why this one was . This cartoon can be found on disc one of the Spotlight collection DVD of " Tom & Jerry " My Grade : B  
  This is one of the greatest sports movies ever made by Hollywood . What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of American history . What makes the story of James J . Corbett especially interesting is that Mr . Corbett introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day . In that respect James J . Corbett was truly innovated . But getting back to the movie , all the performances were excellent . Alexis Smith was beautiful . Indeed , she looked like Nicole Kidman . And although it 's a period piece , the story withstands the test of time ; it has not gone stale . Ward Bond 's portrayal of John L . Sullivan has to be one of the great portrayals of an actual sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scenes are realistic , well-staged and highly effective . That coupled with a great script makes this movie a must .  
  Though the pieces are uneven this collection of 11 short films is truly a moving and human experience . There were some who , in the wake of the emotion on the anniversary of the bombings , took this to be anti-American . I don't think thats the case , even though some parts might be taken that way if you don't look behind the obvious . Ultimately the film is nothing except an attempt by people to express their confusion , sympathy and feelings about what happened . These are stories of people who 's worlds have been shaken up by what happened on a Tuesday in September . As I said this film will move you , probably to tears . Its not always easy to watch , for example the film from Mexico is little more than a black screen with sound , but its effect is such as to lay even the strongest of people low . If you can be strong you really should see this film . It will comfort you and enlighten you and affect you ..  
  I was so glad I came across this short film . I 'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across , so when I saw this and saw that it was nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards , I was so pleased that I actually had a film that I was rooting for . The plot is pretty simple , the director , writer , and star Nacho Vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals . The result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy . It 's a well made short film , well edited and the actors all do a great job . And the last shot of the film is perfect . I highly recommend this film .  
  This is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong . A simple robbery . Pick up some serious change . Get our finances together and everything will be hunky-dory . Butmom and pop 's jewelry store ? No problem . Insurance pays for it all . No guns . Nobody gets hurt . Easy money . Older , more successful ( it would appear ) brother Andy ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) has a few minor problems . Heroin addiction , cocaine habituation . A wife ( Marisa Tomei ) thatwell , he can't seem to perform for . His flat belly days long gone . Younger , sweet , slightly dim-witted younger brother , Hank ( Ethan Hawke ) with a few dinero problems of his own . Behind in child support payments for his daughter , in debt to friends and relatives , not exactly wowing them in the work of work , etc . Sydney Lumet , in this performance at the age of 82 ( ! ) , directs and gets it 99.99 percent right , which is hard to do in a thriller . I have seen more thrillers than I can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes , the improbabilities , the cheesy scenes , and the hurry-up ending . Here Lumet makes a thriller like it 's a work of art . Every detail is perfect . The acting is superb . The plot has no holes . The story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the Bard himself . Hoffman of course is excellent . When you don't have marquee , leading man presence , you have to get by on talent , workmanship and pure concentration . Ethan Hawke , who is no stranger to the sweet , little guy role , adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we don't know whether to pity him or trash him . Albert Finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age . And Marisa Tomei , who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity , manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as Andy 's two timing wife . ( But who could blame her ? ) It 's almost a movie reviewer 's sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars , but if you study this film , as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do , you will notice the kind of excessive ( according to most Hollywood producers ) attention to detail that makes for real art-the sort of thing that only great artists can do , and indeed cannot help but do . ( By the way , I think there were twenty producers on this filmwell , maybe a dozen ; check the credits . ) All I can say in summation is , Way to go Sydney Lumet , author of a slew of excellent films , and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced agekudos . May we all do half so well . Okay , the 00.01 percent . It was unlikely that the father ( Albert Finney ) could have followed the cabs that Andy took around New York without somehow losing the tail . This is minor , and I wish all thrillers could have so small a blip . Also one wonders why Lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of Hank at the end . We can guess and guess . Perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor . Perhaps Lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out , and he just said , " Leave it like that . It really doesn't matter . " And I think it doesn't . What happens to Hank is not going to be good . He isn't the kind of guy who manages to run off to Mexico and is able to start a new life . He is the kind of guy who gets a " light " sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he wasn't really a man when he should have been . See this for Sidney Lumet , one of Hollywood 's best , director of The Pawnbroker ( 1964 ) , The Group ( 1966 ) , Serpico ( 1973 ) , Dog Day Afternoon ( 1975 ) , Network ( 1976 ) , and many more .  
  Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his finest films in his historic career in this very tense , and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children . With an A-list cast headed by Philip Seymour Hoffman ( an Oscar-worthy performance here ) , Ethan Hawke , Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney , Lumet has captured not just elements of botched crime stories such as Reservoir Dogs , but also family stories such as Ordinary People . Many viewers might be confused and feel underwhelmed at the construction of the plot Lumet has gone with here . Instead of showing it in a linear manner , he has gone the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order . I personally found this to be very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next . The script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei , as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman . All the actors are totally engaging to watch and Lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually doesn't delve in . Plenty of action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time , this is a rare movie that doesn't disappoint for one moment .  
  While the title " Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead " comes from an Irish proverb the film plays out like a Greek tragedy . It all starts with a botched robbery and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers attempt to escape the mess they 've gotten themselves into . The cast is well-assembled with Philip Seymour Hoffman & Ethan Hawke playing the aforementioned brothers . Notable support includes Albert Finney as their father and Marisa Tomei as the wife of one brother and lover of the other . Beyond these principals the acting is unremarkable . The story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve . The narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent time shifts . That being said , the film 's unpredictability is somewhat muted since it becomes apparent early on that this story is a tragedy , through and through . All in all , a pretty impressive debut for first-time screenwriter Kelly Masterson . Sidney Lumet 's direction is well handled but I 'm more impressed by the fact that he 's still directing at over eighty years old . I was less impressed by the score by Carter Burwell but it isn't a major distraction . In the end , the film proves to be compelling viewing and while the story & presentation may have superficial similarities to other films this one remains a unique experience .  
  This was one of the DVD 's I recently bought in a set of six called " Frenchfilm " to brush up our French before our planned holiday in beautiful Provence this year . So far , as well as improving our French we have considerably enhanced our appreciation of French cinema . What a breath of fresh air to the stale , predictable , unimaginative , crash bang wallop drivel being churned out by Hollywood . What a good example for screenplay writers , actors , directors and cinematographers to follow . It was so stimulating also to see two identifiable characters in the lead roles without them having to be glossy magazine cover figures . The other thing I liked about this film was the slow character and plot build up which kept you guessing as to how it was all going to end . Is there any real good in this selfish thug who continually treats his seemingly naïve benefactor with the type of contempt that an ex-con would display ? Will our sexually frustrated poor little half deaf heroine prove herself to the answer to her dreams and the situation that fate has bestowed upon her ? The viewer is intrigued by these questions and the actors unravel the answers slowly and convincingly as they face events that challenge and shape their feeling towards each other . Once you have seen this film , like me you may want to see it again . I still have to work out the director 's psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look . The plot does ask for a little imagination when our hero is given a chance to assist our misused and overworked heroine in the office . You must also be broad minded to believe in her brilliant lip reading and how some of the action falls into place . But if you go along for the thrilling ride with this example of French cinema at its best you will come out more than satisfied . Four stars out of five for me .  
  When John Singleton is on , he 's * on * ! And this is one of his better films . Not quite as tight as Boyz n the Hood , but close to it ( and with much of the same stellar cast ) . This film was very well written , very well put together , and very well shot . There 's very little to criticize , and most of my complaints are superficial ( eg : where did Fudge get the money for 6 years of college and a lot of expensive stuff ? No mention of a rich background .. And why doesn't Professor Phibbs have an office ? A professor of his stature * should * have one .. And while we 're at it , for an engineering student , hick or not , Remy 's a pretty dumb character - I 'd think that he 'd have a bit more in the way of basic intelligence - he talks and acts like a total buffoon ) . But that aside , the film was very sharp . A good array of characters and points of view ; and Singleton doesn't take sides in the story - many of the characters are unsympathetic , and he does a good job of interspersing the Panthers and Supremacist scenes together to show the folly on both sides . Much of the cinematography was excellent ; I especially loved the scene where Kirsty Swanson gets intimate with Taryn and Wayne each scene spliced together really well . Also the Malik / Deja scenes were really well shot as well . The dialogue was a bit much at times ; this film had a tendency to get * really * preachy at times , and it also tends to hammer the points it was making over your head when the points would be just as clear with out the bluntness ( we really didn't need the US flag with ' UNLEARN ' typed onto it , give some credit , we 're not morons .. ) . And to top it off , although * most * of the time Singleton uses melodrama quite well , sometimes it gets * way * too cheezy ( like Deja 's death , which is fine until she screams out ' WHY ! ' which simply ruined the entire effect and scene ) . But the acting , in general , was top of the line . Fabulous performances by Omar Epps ( perhaps the best I 've ever seen ) , Kirsty Swanson ( who knew Buffy could act ? ) , Michael Rapaport ( surprised the hell out of me .. after True Romance and Beautiful Girls I though he was a one-role actor ) , and of course Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne are * always * outstanding . Downside ? Jennifer Connelly was flat ; though it 's not completely her fault : her role was stereotypical and one-dimensional . Generic to the highest degree . And Tyra Banks , who had the role , was nothing short of horrid . She whined and whined and whined . Yet another in the long line of models-turned-actresses who failed miserably ( though there are a few who prove the exception to this rule ) . Finally , the soundtrack ! Wow ! An amazing soundtrack ( which is definitely worth buying ! ) which fits the film like a glove . Each scene has a twin song ( although the Tori Amos songs started to * really * annoy me by the end .. not her best work ) . Liz Phair , Rage Against the Machine , Ice Cube .. how can one go wrong ? All in all : a really good watch , a really strong cast , great script , great film . 8/10 .  
  Although DiG ! was being hailed as being closest to what the music industry is like it is highly fabricated . The director has misled the audience into believing the Brian Jonestown Massacre disappeared off the face of the earth post-'98 . And the rivalry between the Dandy Warhols and Jonestown has been milked . The truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film . That said this film is endlessly quotable and is an interesting watch as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art . One of the best things this film has going for it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene . Recommended mostly for the music and the two fantastic bands .  
  Anton Newcombe makes the film and he is the main subject . Watching him knock up a song if not a whole album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent . He thinks he is god but is so prollific and interesting . The DW are not really that interesting in comparison musicly or otherwise . " Hey , do you haver a drivers license ? " , Anton says to the cameraman , " Well lets go pawn this guitar ! " . Great use of archive / home video material . Great to see rock docs still being made . A cool doc about the creative process . If you like this go see Nirvana Live ! Tonight ! Sold Out ! on DVD . A good experience Anton is this film . 8 out of 10  
  Above-average film and acting partly spoiled by its completely predictable story line . Even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time . A scent of " Pleasantville " camp hangs around this flick . As a period piece , it 's more accurate than not . Its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is sketchy but moving . Chris Cooper turns in a first-class performance as Howard 's coal-miner daddy .  
  This movie will kick your ass ! Powerful acting in a story that pushes all of us to live out our dreams . Jake Gyllenhaal will go places from here , and the supporting cast was superb . Why would would anyone want to stay in Coalville and develop black lung anyway ?  
  A simple and effective film about what life is all about , responding to challenges . It took a lot of gall for Homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son , to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate . It took also three different challenges for Homer and his friends to conquer a personal and free future . The challenge of the first ever man-made artificial satellite , Sputnik 1 , a Soviet satellite , a milestone in human history , a turning point that Homer and his friends could not miss , did not want to miss . Then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds . Finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack , even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity , and even then Homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams . But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough . Homer is the carrier of the project but he is also the carrier of the inspiration he and his friends need . If he is the one who is going to get the university scholarship , because his friends gave him precedence , his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate , thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes . It is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road . But the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man , like mining or football . The working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father . If the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day , the working class fate I am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap . Here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think . This might have been the fourth challenge Homer had to face : the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by his own father .

  Dev Anand ( or Prashant ) and Zeenat Aman ( Jasbir / Janice ) are siblings brought up in single parent families . Jasbir ( the sister ) grows up in an affluent environment but this is not enough to lead her to reject her life and ultimately join a hippie movement that eventually leads her to drugs . Prashant ( the brother ) on the other hand grows up in a less affluent environment but grows up to be a matured gentleman . The story marks Prashant making efforts to save his little sister ( who is perpetually in a trance ) from a hostile hippie environment . This movie stands the test of time , commenting that cults and hippie groups are a place for those who give up on their lives when they should instead stand up and be counted in the face of adversity . Great music compositions in this movie that mean different things in different situations and to different people , and the director brings forth an eerie feeling to it .  
  The story for Hare Rama Hare Krishna actually came to Dev Anand 's mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in Kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests against his previous Prem Pujari in Calcutta . He was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt Prem Pujari 's posters . But the life of hippies re ignited a story in Dev 's mind to be made into a film . This was Dev Anand 's perhaps best directorial effort . The film was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and Zeenat Aman as Dev 's sister made a tremendous impact . This film was Dev Anand 's call to the nation to keep up their moral values . It is about a Montereal based Indian family and the brother 's role is a very affectionate one for his sister . But the parents quarrel and separate leaving Prashant ( Dev ) with mother and Jasbir ( Zeenat ) with father . She is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and she eventually believes that she will never see Prashant again . She is ill treated by her step mother and she runs away from home . Dev grows up to be a pilot and he learns that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with certain hippies . To reunite with his sister , Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti ( Mumtaz ) who was to later marry him and also Janice who in reality is Jasbir with a new name and new identity . She has forgotten her childhood and Dev too . Dev has to get his sister back amongst all other happenings which include his being suspected as a thief in Kathmandu and the people are after his life . This was a story well directed and acted-both by Dev Anand . We see more of Zeenat Aman than of Mumtaz . But the music by Rahul Dev Burman was well composed . Dev had first offered the music to be composed by Sachin Dev Burman but Burman Da did not want Dev to do the film . He was very close to Dev and his earlier film Prem Pujari , though was good , but had been opposed in Calcutta . Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter subject as he thought hippie cultist film might reignite people 's anger against Dev . But Dev continued with the film reassuring Burman Da and the film was indeed a success . R D Burman had Asha Bhosle sing the award winning Dum Maro Dum . Kanchi re Kanchi re was another good number . Overall it is a good film .  
  If you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor , then you will enjoy this flick . I don't understand why anyone wouldn't enjoy this one . Take it for what it is : a vehicle for Dennis Hopper to mess with your head and make you laugh . It ain't Shakespeare , but it is well done . Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one - Better than any episode of Baywatch - and shows a knack for subtle humor . Too bad she hasn't had many opportunities to expand on that . Tom Berenger fits his role of " real Navy " perfectly and William McNamara does a solid job as a hustler . Throw in a walk-on by Hopper in the middle of the chase for " the Cherry on this Sundae " and you 've got a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing . I bought this one as soon as it was available . Brain-candy .  
  My wife and I have watched this movie twice . Both of us used to be in the Military . Besides being funny as hell , it offers a very realistic view of life in the Navy from the perspective of A Navy enlisted man , and tells it " like it really is " . We 're adding this movie to our permanent collection !  
  Several young Iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain . When they 're caught , they 're penned in an area where the match remains within earshot , but out of sight . The prisoners plead to be let go , but rules are rules . Given the pedigree of its director , Jafar Panahi , it was disarming to discover that Offside is a comedy , and a frequently hilarious one . In 1997 's The Mirror , Panahi presents two versions of Iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is " real " . In 2000 's The Circle , several Iranian women step outside the system ; their transgressions are different , but they all end up in the same tragic place . However , thinking now about Offside , it 's hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy , because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous . As the women demand to know why they can't watch the soccer match and their captors struggle to answer , the only possible outcome is comedy . What makes Offside most affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system . They are simply soccer fans and patriots , and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly , they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nation 's grasp .  
  wow , how can I even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes ? It was surely the highlight of my year-nay-my life . As if the raptor graphics weren't amazing enough , the award-winning editors continued to use the exact same shot throughout the entire movie , even when the background didn't actually match up with the setting of the scene . Wow , what genius . And while the movie is full of plot-holes ( for instance , a few clips of a t-Rex type animal where a raptor should be and one key moment where Pappy finds a torture chamber , screams " Colin 's a girl ! " and runs out ) I will never forget the brilliance that is Raptor Planet . Thank you Sci-Fi for another classic .  
  Having lived in Ontario my whole life , in the same town that Marlene Moore grew up in , I 've heard stories of her from my parents , grandparents and family members . So when I found out that they would be filming a movie about her , and that the beginning would be shot on my street , and her house quite close to mine I was excited . If you read the book Rock a Bye Baby , which is about Marlene Moore you get quite the different image of her as a person , she was considered awkwardly beautiful by people who really had the chance to know her with the exception of her own family who frequently abused her as a child , with the exception of one of her brothers . Also , if you live in my area and are intelligent enough to listen to those around you who knew her from school you 'd find out that she was truly wounded before she even set foot in an institution , she was always defensive and what would seem like an unwillingness to learn in a school environment was actually embarrassment over the fact that she was unable to . Marlene did not deserve the life she was given , with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive . It was the government and the people around her that aided further in her death by not attempting to understand her needs and why she did what she did . I still find myself angered that she was put in jail for self-defense from a man who tried to rape her . As her brother once said , " They didn't know what to do with her so they locked her away and it killed her . " I believe in that with all my heart . Rest in peace Marlene , you deserve it so much .  
  I didn't really go into " Reign Over Me " knowing exactly what to expect either from the director or the story . The plot was easy enough to understand , I suppose . This guy 's whole family died in 9/11 , and he shuts the world out of his life . Alright . I didn't know if it was going to use the attachment of terrorism as a platform to speak on that or other issues relating to it , and it really doesn't on a very obvious level , so if you 're scared to be surrounded by political opinions that may be different from yours , I wouldn't worry about it . I think the writing even made a point never to explicitly mention " September the eleventh " . Overall , I was impressed . It was a very moving picture . The movie has a sense of humor , and it is very sharp , but it is definitely a drama where it counts . I typically don't like to think that comedic actors are incapable of actually acting , but sometimes , let 's be honest , they are . Adam Sandler is definitely capable of it ( and though I think so , you may disagree , Jim Carrey is also very well-rounded .. sometimes ) . Sandler 's portrayal of Charlie Fineman took a character that on the surface seems completely unreal and makes it become absolutely believable . I read many reviews that criticized the writing of Alan Johnson 's ( Don Cheadle in another excellent role , if not one that seems similar to a few of his more recent pictures ) wife , who is played well by Jada Pinkett Smith , calling her static and dull , but that is completely untrue . She has depth , but some of it gets hidden behind the main story , which does drift in and out of focus occasionally . ( Which also brings to mind some very unusual transitions done early in the movie , with a weird " Make everything out of focus " fadeout . After about the first 40 minutes , they aren't used anymore . Maybe it 's significant for the characters outlook , artistically , or maybe they just realized how irritating it was . ) The film gradually begins to reveal to us the point ( one of several , but definitely the most explicit ) of the story , which is that sometimes people have to deal with grief in their own way . Maybe it seems unorthodox to us , maybe it seems downright unhealthy , but maybe what some people want more than anything is just to forget . To just exist . The films soundtrack was excellent , and it used music to pursue and amplify moods , rather than establish them , which gives credit to the actors and the writers . The movie takes it 's name from the song " Love , Reign O'er Me " , off of The Who 's rock opera , Quadrophenia . The song itself is fairly insignificant to the actual story , but it is used powerfully in the movie over the course of the climax , and at the very end . The movie is paced well , and does not feel like it 's dragging anywhere in it 's length , which is a little over 2 hours . If you can accept Adam Sandler 's portrayal of this deeply heartbroken and broken down man , you will enjoy the movie . You will become entangled in the story , and you will genuinely feel for the characters in every minute of it . It is not the best movie of the year , and there 's nothing groundbreaking or positively amazing in it , but it 's a very enjoyable , watchable movie , all in all .  
  I saw this at a screening last night too . I was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what I expected . Not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion . I won't bother rehashing the plot too much because I think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better . But I will say that Adam Sandler 's performance was really refreshing and real . He was funny , and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies . Don Cheadle was believable as always . This movie isn't funny like Borat or Billy Madison but it has a good pace about it . I 'd say 90 % of the audience laughed for most of the film . Midway through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all together . I also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friend / white friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves .  
  Impactful film of four city slickers in crisis in Appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity . Each of four businessmen face their darkest fears when they tackle a challenging whitewater trip , on a river about to be replaced by a dam . When locals along the way decide to " have their way " with the interlopers it leads to several deaths and loads of trauma for the survivors . Each of the travelers is outstanding , although Voight gives the lead and strongest performance . The rural scenery and culture is well-captured , including the breathtaking dueling banjos sequence . I saw this on a date when it came out , not exactly the perfect date movie ( although we both enjoyed it ) . I sort of remember this as a break-out dramatic performance for Burt , Voight was already established . Not the sort of movie you could watch every week but it has a strong punch and is beautifully filmed .  
  This film was enjoyable but for the wrong reasons . The co-ordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments . Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene together near the end , where Williamson says to Ginty , " you sure do get around buddy boy ! " . I did enjoy this film only for Ginty and Williamson , but not for the storyline that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest ad-libbed most likely . A film with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so . It seems odd that no one else has a credit in the film , maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look . The one thing this film does have going for it is that it is quite violent , so that tripled with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty make for a film worth seeing .  
  After gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex-rental DVDs , I figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than Sam Mendes ? For a number of reasons , " American Beauty " doesn't appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that Tom Hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade . For this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins , and is simply wonderful to watch because of it . And despite my usual allergy to any film with Tom Hanks ' name on it ( still can't watch " Big " without wanting a cat to kick ) , I 'm glad I gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you 'll kick yourself for if you miss it . Normally squeaky-clean Hanks plays Michael Sullivan , a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during Prohibition in the early 1930 's . He is also a professional hit-man to mob boss John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons . But after his eldest ( Tyler Hoechlin ) witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing , the pair are forced to go on the run as John seeks to tidy the matter up . Soon , father and son are pursued to Chicago where a fellow hit-man ( a menacing Jude Law ) is waiting for them . On the face of it , it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as I 've said , this isn't really about gangsters at all . It 's about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances . Hanks is ( * grits teeth * ) superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little Hoechlin is also good as Sullivan 's son . In all honesty , there is not a single performance that I could single out as weaker than the others - the cast is pretty much faultless . As is the cinematography and costumes ( and it 's not often I praise costumes ! ) which recreates the 30 's with stunning effect . There has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades . This could easily have looked rubbish - they admit that the early 30 's look was difficult to put down - but it doesn't and that deserves every bit of credit . Chicago especially looks fantastic , lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats . True time-travel , even if a little CGI is needed . The story is also a winner , offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain . Law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer Maguire and proves that you don't have to be Cagney or De Niro or Brando to play a gangster . The film is decidedly noir-ish , driving rain and ill-lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are ( finally ) seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts . The whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the Tommy-Gun shootouts and extortion rackets . It can feel a little slow in places , especially if you 're used to masses of gun-play in movies like most modern audiences ( like yours truly ) but sometimes , words can speak louder than actions . Mendes has delivered a fine follow-up to his Oscar-winning debut , a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch . " Road To Perdition " may not be to everyone 's tastes but this is one DVD I shall not be exchanging anytime soon .  
  I must say , I was surprised with the quality of the movie . It was far better than I expected . Scenario and acting is quite good . The director made a good job as well . Although some scenes look a bit clumsy , it is a decent movie overall . The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end . The mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good . The plot was clear , consistent and well thought . Some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development . Moral of the story , it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good .  
  Ultra-grim crime drama from Pou-Soi Cheang , the director of " Home Sweet Home " . Tonally , it reminded me of Billy Tang 's " Run and Kill " , although it 's not as polished as that . Nevertheless , it 's an engaging , flawed bit of mayhem about a Cambodian loner , Pang ( Edison Chen ) , who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer . While fleeing the scene , he kills the partner of cop Sam Wai , who , to add insult to injury , is in the midst of dealing with his dying father , so Sam begins an insane , obsessive manhunt for Pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence . There must be something in the air lately because I 've never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as I have lately . This is grim , nasty stuff , which is why I 'm so partial to it , and I applaud its downbeat vibe . It 's visually arresting and the sound design is very unique . Dramatically , everything spirals downwards until every character finds him - or herself in a world of screaming pain . A subplot involving Pang 's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts a fine act of grotesque surgery .  
  i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such an impressive movie without any music . but it is . just the pictures . watch out for that picture : anne talking with that little boy benny ' bout the soul . really strong . might make you feel different .  
  I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now I 've seen the film ! What a ride ! And what a trip to finally get to know Darius Weems ! Such a courageous , wise , funny and talented spirit ! And what a Crew ! To listen to Darius laughing from being in the water at Panama City , to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in Louisiana , the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon , the excitement of rafting through some rapids , the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi , and the phone calls home , and as always - boys will be boys . This film needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike . Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage . And the Crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation . They got Darius a new wheelchair ; they documented accessibility problems ; they took Darius on the trip of his life ; and they touched many , many lives . By raising awareness of DMD and encouraging funding for research , this film will help accomplish the final goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD .  
  The Good Thing about this movie : The concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes . It also makes you think of those little things in life that could greatly affect the life of someone else without you ever knowing . Its a small world and this little movie shows us . The Bad Thing : There are too many characters and its hard to tell who the main character is but its still a great movie . Its a great movie and many people compare it to Magnolia which I haven't seen . 8/10 Not Rated-I would rate it PG-13 for brief violence , some language and sexual situations .  
  This is by far the funniest short made by the two comic geniuses . From the time they walk in , to the time Hardy just falls off the roof , this keeps me laughing hysterically . I highly suggest that every fan of Laurel and Hardy should see this short . I also recommend all of the Ghost Series . If you are looking for laughs , see this movie and you will be happy .  
  The romance of the movie , which is also its main theme , is good and nicely presented . However , the surrounding of the love story is too lyric , graphical and unrealistic . Even worse , the psychology of the main character is weird and incomprehensible , exactly like the end of the movie . Don't hesitate to watch this movie , if it attracted your interest , but don't expect too much of it either .  
  I liked this film very much . The story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow . There is no resolution to the story whatsoever , and you are left to wonder what really happened . Since I like that sort of film I enjoyed this . I especially like the " dating " scenes between the boys and I was drawn into their lives . And of course any film with a naked Staphane Rideau will get a couple of extra points . ; - )

Anderson is delightful . She doesn't look old at all , still hot indeed . Kristan Dunst looks lovely and does a pretty good job . Others are also pretty good . ' How To Lose Friends & Alienate People ' is a excellent entertainer . Don't miss this flick !  
  We first watched this film as part of a festival of new Argentine films in 2000 at the Walter Reade . Although we liked it , we didn't think it was extraordinary . Watching it for a second time , we found a different meaning in this look at life in Buenos Aires . The film takes place in one of the darkest days of Argentina , as the DeLaRua administration was ending . The country was in turmoil after the economy , which had flourished earlier in the 1990s , under the artificially climate President Menen created . It was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen and people got themselves living a nightmare . The story begins just as Santamarina , a bank employee , is fired because the collapse of the economy . Instead of receiving sympathy from his wife , she locks him out of the apartment and he , for all practical purposes , becomes a homeless man . He takes to the streets trying to make ends meet . The other story introduces us to Ariel , a young Jew , interviewing for a job in a Spanish company . It 's almost a miracle he gets the job . His father , Simon , owns a small restaurant in the Jewish quarter of " El Once " in the center of the city . Things go from bad to worse , when Ariel 's mother dies suddenly . Only Estela , the young woman who is in love with Ariel , comes to help father and son . Santamarina , who is a clean man , has to resort to take showers wherever he can . He chooses a ladies ' room in one of the subway stations . When the attendant , Elsa , finds him naked , she becomes furious , but she comes to her senses when she realizes the unhappy circumstances of this man who has seen better times . They become romantically involved , and Santamarina in one of his trips through the street garbage , finds an infant . Elsa , while surprised , wants to do the right thing . But Santamarina convinces her of the meaning of an innocent life in their lives will cement their love . Ariel , who has met the gorgeous Laura at work , begins a turbulent and heavy sexual affair with his beautiful co-worker , who unknown to him , is involved in a lesbian affair . Ariel who free lances by photographing weddings and other occasions , feels a passion for Laura , but he realizes what Estela has sacrificed in order to help his father and still loves him . Daniel Burman , whose " El Abrazo Partido " we thought was excellent , did wonders with this film . Things are put in its proper perspective after a second viewing recently and we must apologize for not having perceived it the first time around . If anything , this second time , the nuances of the screen play Mr . Burman and Emiliano Torres wrote , make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of what the country was living during those dark days . Daniel Hendler , who plays Ariel , has collaborated with Mr . Burman before to surprising results . He is not ' movie star pretty ' , yet , he is handsome . This actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work . Enrique Pineyro is another magnificent surprise . His Santamarina is disarming . In spite of all the bad things that have fallen on him , he keeps a rosy attitude toward everyone he meets . Stefania Sandrelli , the interesting Italian actress , makes a great contribution to the film with her Elsa . Hector Alterio , one of the best Argentine actors plays the small part of Simon . The gorgeous Chiara Coselli is seen as Laura and Melina Petrielli appears as the noble Estela . " Esperando al mesias " proves Daniel Burman is a voice to be reckoned with in the Argentine cinema .  
  Where was this film when I was a kid ? After his parents split up Tadashi moves with his mom to live his his grandfather . Tadashi 's sister stays with their dad and they talk frequently on the phone . Grandfather is only " here " every third day . Moms never really home . The kids always are picking on the poor kid . During a village festival Tadashi is chosen the " kirin rider " or spiritual champion of the peace and justice . Little does he suspect that soon he will have to actually step into role of hero as the forces of darkness join up with the rage of things discarded in a plot to destroy mankind and the spiritual world . Okay that was the easy part . Now comes the hard part , trying to explain the film . This is a great kids film . No this is a great film , flawed , ( very flawed ? ) but a great film none the less . It unfolds like all of those great books you loved as a kid and is just as dense at times as Tadashi struggles to find the strength to become a hero . Watching it I felt I was reading a great book , and thought how huge this would have been if it was a book . I loved that the film does not follow a normal path . Things often happen out of happenstance or through miscommunication , one character gets sucked into events simply because his foot falls asleep . There are twists and turns and moments that seem like non sequiters and are all the more charming for it ( which is typical Miike ) Certainly its a Takashi Miike film . That Japanese master of film is clearly in charge of a film that often touching , scary and funny all at the same time . No one except Miike seems to understand that you can have many emotions at the same time , or that you can suddenly have twists as things get dark one second and then funny the next . I admire the fact that Miike has made a film that is bleak and hopeful , that doesn't shy away from being scary , I mean really scary , especially for kids . This is the same dark territory that should be in the Harry Potter movies but rarely is . This a dark Grimms tale with humor . My first reaction upon seeing the opening image was that I couldn't believe anyone would begin a kids film with a picture of the end of the world , then I realized who was making the movie . Hats off to Miike for making a movie that knows kids can handle the frightening images . Its also operating on more than one level . The mechanical monsters that the bad guys make are forged from mankind 's discarded junk . Its the rage of being thrown away that fuels the monsters . One of the Yokai ( spirits ) talks about the rage sneakers thrown away because they are dirty or too small feels when they are tossed . You also have one of the good guys refusing to join the bad guys because that would be the human thing to do . Its a wild concept , but like other things floating around its what lifts this movie to another level . ( there are a good many riffs and references to other movies , TV shows and novels that make me wonder who this film is for since kids may not understand them , though many parents will ) And of course there are the monsters . They run the gamut from cheesy to spectacular with stops everywhere in between . Frankly you have to forgive the unevenness of their creation simply because they are has to be hundreds if not thousands of monsters on screen . Its way cool and it works . One of the main characters is a Yokai which I think is best described as a hamster in a tunic and is often played by a stuffed animal , it looks dumb and yet you will be cheering the little bugger and loving every moment he rides on Tadashi 's head . ( Acceptance is also easier if you 've ever seen the old woodcuts of the weird Japanese monsters ) I mentioned flaws , and there are a few . The effects are uneven , some of the sudden turns are a bit odd ( even if understandable ) and a few other minor things which are fading now some two hours after watching the film .. None of them truly hurt the film over all , however most kind of keep you from being completely happy with the movie . I really loved this movie . I 'm pretty sure that if I saw this as a kid it would have been my favorite film of all time . ( where 's the English dub ? ) . See this movie . Its a great trip . ( Besides its a good introduction to the films of Miike minus the blood and graphic sex )  
  Peaches is truly a marvelous film . I write this to refute a review from someone called ' Auscrit ' , that has appeared on this site . First of all the idea that either Monahans first film ' The Interview ' is somehow TV is an extraordinary statement . Here is a film that has been significantly praised around the world as is simply one of the best Australian Films ever made . It fully deserved to win best picture . Peaches is a brave , bold and courageous departure . For me it works on every level and I have now seen it twice . Monahan is a filmmaker who is demonstrating great skill and incredible sensitivity . For ' Auscrit ' to make the comment that it is another TV movie etc and that Hugo Weaving is no good simply does not ' get ' the film . Or more particularly does not want to get it . Frankly it is the sort of comment that one expects from either another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both . Or someone from inside the industry either distribution , exhibition or bureaucracy . Your average punter , I have found just does not write comments like that . I have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the film Sommersault . One has to wonder what people think they are looking at . Unfortunately in Australia at the time SS was released the push was , if you did not like it then there was something wrong with you not the film . This manipulation of the media is pretty common down under . The reality is the only similarity between the two films are that they are rights of passage films . Unfortunately for me SS is a film about nothing , that could have been told in 15 minutes . I see it as a one dimensional film about anxiety . Peaches in comparison is a master piece . Personally I cannot wait to what Monahan does next as he is clearly way ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema . In conclusion if the film does not win all at this years AFI 's and IF awards , then it is a rigged game . As for Auscrit , please find something more constructive do with your time  
  According to the book The Last of the Cowboy Heroes which is about Joel McCrea , Audie Murphy , and Randolph Scott , the author says that Albuquerque was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost . Hadn't been seen in years . Good thing for western fans somebody was doing some spring cleaning at Paramount because a print was apparently found and now it 's out on the open market . Albuquerque is a pretty good western too with Scott involved in a family feud with Uncle George Cleveland . George Cleveland sends for his nephew Randolph Scott with the intention of making him part of his freighting business , headquartered in the fast growing settlement of Albuquerque . Cleveland is more than just a business owner , he 's the town boss which he runs from a wheelchair . He even has the sheriff in his pocket . Randolph Scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing . That includes not backing relatives up when they 're villains . He goes to work for a rival outfit headed by brother and sister Russell Hayden and Catherine Craig . Cleveland is full of all kinds of tricks and he even sends for a western Mata Hari in the person of Barbara Britton to worm her way into the confidence of his rivals . Barbara 's great as the homespun vixen who develops her own agenda . Randolph Scott 's original home studio was Paramount , it was where his first studio contract was with . Albuquerque marked the last film he ever did for Paramount and they gave him a good one . Note also Lon Chaney , Jr . , who is George Cleveland 's chief henchman , a rather loathsome bully of a man and Gabby Hayes , who is just Gabby Hayes . Albuquerque must have been loved by Republicans across the nation in 1948 with its chief villain as a town boss who rules from a wheelchair . A certain Democrat from a wheelchair had made hash of them for four straight presidential elections and he was gone . They had high hopes of winning the White House that year too , but things went awry and they had to settle for an ersatz boss getting his comeuppance in Albuquerque . I 'm not sure why Cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was really made of it in the plot . My guess is he was injured and played the part that way because he had to . Still Albuquerque must have had great appeal to the GOP market .  
  I looked at this movie with my child eyes , and I wasn't disappointed . The story is well-known , some abandoned orphan has to be brought to his parents by an improbable trio ( mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal ) .. And I don't want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut . This one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture . Briefly : it works , it is funny and it is a " must-see " with your children ( they 'll like it ) .  
  This is my first CG animated film that I 've ever seen . Usually , the look of other animated films made me reticent to see them . Not Ice Age . I wanted to see it the moment I saw the trailer with Scrat , the hilarious sabertooth squirrel . Ice Age was sporadically funny and overall fun film to watch . The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby , set 20,000 years in the past . The visuals were great . Simply beautiful . It 's one thing to create convincing aninmation , it 's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and Ice Age is great to look at with its stylized visuals . Blue Sky Studios is a company to look out for in the future .  
  Finally I got to see the infamous " Ice Age " . Apart from maybe not being as dead funny as I 'd hoped for after seeing the brilliant teaser there is not a bad word I can say about it . Sure , it 's not as glamorous as a Disney production ( besides , it is Fox 's 1st attempt at a full length CG movie ) but it 's got immense heart and on some occasions ( like the look in Manfred 's eyes after we see the sad glimpse of his past ) I found myself on the verge of tears . But when they reunited the baby with its father I just couldn't hold them in anymore . A movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and cliché and manages to bring more than the best out of it ; the end result being one of the most touching animated creations I have ever seen . Great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you ( and great voice talents as well ) and many funny memorable scenes , especially from Scrat 's behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go . Plus the Dodo scene , which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002 . I honestly don't get it , but for some reason it really looks like CG animation will be taking the upper hand in the future . But if it just means that there will be more movies like this one ( and who can forget Pixar 's creations ) then I don't really mind , at least for now . 9/10  
  In this 1943 film , Judy Garland is deemed not to be ready for the big-time yet by the man who loves her-Van Heflin . This film was certainly a big change for Mr . Heflin , especially after his supporting Oscar win the year before in " Johnny Eager . " Wasn't Spring Byington too old to be the widowed mother of 5 children , with four of them appearing to look like her grandchildren ? The singing and dancing are just marvelously staged but the way that the blossoming romance between Heflin and Garland was depicted left a lot to be desired . It was a Gigi-like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer .  
  I first rented this film many years ago , and was completely enthralled by it . Just recently , feeling a strange need to revisit some of the way-too-few films that I 've immensely enjoyed in my lifetime , I decided to give " Erendira " another look . And I 'm glad I did , as I soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film . The story is about a teenaged girl ( Erendira , played remarkably by Claudia O'hana - in some respects she resembles Winona Ryder ! ) who accidentally burns down her grandmother 's mansion after which the grandmother , played downright hypnotically by Irene Papas , forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages . The viewing is at once fascinating and compelling - though , inspite of the basic premise , which deals with prostitution , is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content . The story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother , and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn - which , by the way , is in the rough and tumble part of rural Mexico . The film is very atmospheric , arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality . It sometimes borders on the bizarre , but not to the point of , say , a David Lynch film . It 's also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature , read the comments from previous viewers below .. Often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion , quiet and melancholy , adding just the right musical accents to highlight the Mexican setting . The cinematography of the rural places , many of which are in the desert , is quite superb . The film moves at a nice pace , neither too fast nor too slow , and after every scene I felt I had to rewind the tape and play it over again , just because it makes you want to do that . For me anyway , it really is that compelling . Hopefully you will see the film in its Spanish language version , with subtitles . I studied Spanish in high school as well as in college , and I was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue . Por ejemplo : " El mundo no es tan grande como pensaba . " ( " The world 's not as big as I thought " - i . e . , It 's a small world . ) This film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine , which , upon drinking , is immensely satisfying , however , you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there aren't more bottles just like this one .  
  I really liked this movie . Of course the idea is pretty much out there .. the federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an small-time thief to lure a more dangerous thief / computer hacker out of hiding . But Alvin Sanders , the man who the feds have " volunteered " to be implanted with the device , is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while . Alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good-humored but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem . Definetly worth a watch .  
  If you find yourself in need of an escape , something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world , Domino will satisfy that need . This is entertainment , after all ! The plot keeps your brain in motion - one of those movies ( like Usual Suspects ) where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out . I wondered about Domino Harvey herself , how her life became of interest to Hollywood . As for the acting , lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers . And any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well . Not once did I think of Kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume . And granted , Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often , but here , despite the violence , he shows signs of being capable of caring for other people .  
  If you 've ever wondered why they don't make porn with a plot , watch Dream Quest . On the one hand , you have to give the Armstrong credit both for making the effort to capitalize on this idea and for using such a strong adult cast to put some name power behind it . On the other hand , it also quickly becomes apparent why most porns never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialog connecting sex scenes together . These people simply cannot act ( and the story is , unfortunately , lame to a ridiculous degree ) . Still , I gave it a 7 because it was a nice try and there didn't seem to be much of an effort to cut corners . Also , I 'd like to see more attempts like this one . Maybe someday I will see the perfect combination of porn and plot .  
  I saw this film in Winnipeg recently - appropriate , given the location used . I first read Lawrence 's book back in the 70 's and for me , it 's always been a very powerful picture of the trials of aging in our society . It resonated when I was young , and it resonates even more now . When the film came out , I was keen to see if the story could survive . and was thoroughly impressed , especially with Ellen Burstyn 's performance . She manages to give us a complete human being , even though the character is generally cranky and judgmental - someone that you wouldn't want to live with . It 's great to be able to see favourite characters come to life so authentically .  
  As perhaps one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school , I thought I would add my comments . Seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way detracted from the film . The characters have so many complexities , everyone can relate to them in their own way . The brilliance of the adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perceptions onto the lives of the characters , rather than being spoon-fed an opinion . You can love them or dislike them , and still feel the emotional impact of the movie . Wonderful performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne really bring the characters to life . I 'd highly recommend it .  
  The characters are unlikeable and the script is awful . It 's a waste of the talents of Deneuve and Auteuil .  
  I gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned . From the domestic violence , to sexuality and many of the taboos therein . Outside of the gore I really would not call this horror so much as I would science fiction . It 's bleak , depressing and hopeless . While I don't mind a less than cheery ending , I 'm really very tired of the " humans suck " cliché that 's central to every movie . I know you can't get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self-hatred as a member of the human race , but how 's ' bout as a writer / director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN RACE are evil ! Right now , if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die , just go out , find a lake and swim ' til your arms are tired . This way you won't be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me I deserve to die for being alive . It 's silly , not thoughtful , and boring .  
  Unfortunately I made a mistake and I paid 7 Euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie . My points ; Film is based on 2 things ; 1 ) Ethnical point of View : As it happens on most of the American Films , the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the Asian culture . But unfortunately it is not enough . Knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods doesn't make a person understand a culture . For example shaving is the sign of clean life in Asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that . Lebanese people are Christian ( Ok they got that ) and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arabic countries . The main difference between eastern and western culture is we don't make ethnocentrism . So we don't judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film . 2 ) Sexual revolution of a girl : There is nothing much to say about this . Show me 10 girls which had these on their sexual awakening than I will say that I am wrong . I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre . Please watch Dr . Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor . A black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it . Where is the truth ? Where is the meaning about the movie .  
  The tenuous connection between this film and the first Grease is established right at the beginning of the film when Didi Conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young Maxwell Caulfield who is a British exchange student . Although in the previous film Olivia Newton St . John 's foreign speech pattern is not explained , it 's explained here Caulfield is her cousin . What 's Conn still doing in school , I guess she just likes hanging around Rydell High even though now she 's a beautician . Caulfield 's a smart kid , so of course the hood types led by Adrian Zmed have him labeled as a nerd . And that 's especially bad when Zmed 's girl friend decides she likes Caulfield . But being a nerd just isn't going to cut it . That 's when Caulfield decides to put on a modern day Zorro act . He gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride . He gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face . If getting Michelle Pheiffer is not in the cards , Caulfield won't have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he 's outfitted . Grease 2 introduced Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed . If you saw the first Grease film , a much better film , than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out . In addition to Conn , Eve Arden , Sid Caesar , and Dody Goodman , all faculty members from the original Grease return in their roles . The music score isn't remotely as good as the songs that come from the original . It 's not that Grease 2 is bad , it 's just not all that great .  
  When I was 11 , Grease 2 was like crack . It was a classless , shameful , euphoric , and powerfully addictive experience . My sister and I would watch it , rewind it , and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another . So , if you are an 11-year old girl , and you reviewed this film as " brilliant " or " fun " or " better than the original Grease , " you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass . If , however , you are not a little girl , you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an inane , artless , slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production , distribution , and / or consumption . For the sake of criticism , I will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows 1 . In a well-executed musical , the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters . In Grease 2 , with a few debatable exceptions , to the music is obscenely pointless . Most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way ( " Score Tonight , " " Reproduction , " " Do It For Our Country , " and " Prowlin ' " ) without making one concrete statement about any of the film 's characters or themes . Plus , all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance . 2 . The T-birds should be badass , and if not at least somewhat likable , but instead each of them is an annoying wussy-dufus-loser . In the end , when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred T-bird jacket and initiates him into the gang , Michael should kick it to the ground , spit on it , and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it . But of course , he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads , there is no greater honor than to be one with the T-birds . 3 . Since Michael is beautiful , smart , kind , resourceful , and above average in everyway ( his musical impotence notwithstanding ) , it is feasible that Stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask . Stephanie , on the other hand , is a slovenly , slack-jawed , bubble gum smacking , dirty sweatshirt wearing , gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat . So aside from being pretty ( I guess ) , she harbors no likable characteristics , thus , audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of Michael 's attraction to her . I could go on and on , but I didn't want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair . I will say this though , to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time 's sake : Grease 2 is an experience akin to re-living your first kiss . Only you are 32 now and kissing a snot-nosed 13-year old kid with acne and slobby braces . The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed . Trust me .  
  Why do all movies on Lifetime have such anemic titles ? " An Unexpected Love " - ooh , how provocative ! " This Much I know " would have been better . The film is nothing special . Real people don't really talk like these characters do and the situations are really hackneyed . The straight woman who " turns " lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character . If you wanna watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet fashion , you might enjoy this . Although it seems like it was written by someone who doesn't really get out in the world to observe people . Why am I wasting my time writing about it ?  
  i 've discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging . the zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary . then you get to the movie and it 's women with raccoon masks on . zero special effects .. and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet . the funny thing is that Lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie . the only thing i can think is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a " cult classic " .. however , i can't possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made . the real horror in this film is how bad it is . i 'm embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another Lommel film again !  
  Its spelled S L A S H E R S . I was happy when the main character flashed her boobs . That was pretty tight . Before and after that the movie pretty much blows . The acting is like E-list and it 's shown well in the movie . Not to mention it is so low budget that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are played by the same person . The whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film . The only other reason I liked the movie was because Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny . They said many stupid things that made me laugh . Other than that if you see this movie at Blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind Lawnmowerman 2 . Anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated .  
  i couldn't help but think of behind the mask : the rise of leslie vernon ( a massively more amazing film ) when watching this because of the realistic feel to it as well as the great innovative idea . this could have been a GREAT film . the acting is .. from some of the actors alright . from others .. it 's downright horrible . that aside the idea is great and the format is great . the story is pretty good as well , though suffering often from big blows to the logical mind . nevermind that though right ? it IS a horror movie after all . i really want to see this remade .. i really want it to be the fantastic film that it wants to be . however ( and you can't really fault the minds behind the movie for this ) this is obviously built upon a shoe string budget . and the fx really hurt the film overall . great movie . .. if you were to swap out for some better acting and slightly better fx . whoever wrote it should keep going though , great idea here .  
  Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made . The whole plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl , and all the attempts made to stop them . How Tom Selleck and Donna Mills ' careers managed to survive this is beyond me . However , the most frustrating thing about it was THERE WAS NO FOOTBALL IN IT AT ALL ! Avoid this one if possible .  
  Other than the great cinematography by the marvelous James Wong Howe in the battle scenes , this film is a true stinker . This is the second film that I 've seen in recent days directed by Alexander Korda . The first was Charles Laughton 's " Rembrandt . " It was so lousy that I shut it off . This one I 'm afraid is not very much better . Flora Robson is as ugly as ever as Queen Elizabeth . Perhaps , her performance as the virgin Queen was good for 1937 standards but when you compare it to that of a Helen Mirren , it is absolutely no match . In robotic fashion , Robson states her lines . Her battle message to the English troops is so lackluster in spirit . Even a dashing Laurence Olivier can't save this utter piece of boredom . Future wife Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesn't really convey anything here . To think , that Scarlett was 2 years later ! It 's a shame that history with the Spanish Armada is made out to be so boring in this film .  
  LL Cool J performed much better in this movie that I expected ! He did a fabulous job acting as a " renegade " cop within a " renegade " department . From the very beginning , he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he 's in . He acts as a sort of " gentle giant " - a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody , yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start - and he does an amazing job . He was quite clearly the best character in the movie . This was certainly a performance that will not win Morgan Freeman any awards . After starring in powerhouse films like the Shawshank Redemption this film was certainly a step down . His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor - and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner . There are so many ways his character ( Moses Ashford ) could have taken a more pivotal role . That he didn't was disappointing and a true let-down . I was hoping to see more from him in this film . Timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry . His portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive . This movie is a typical action movie that ( at least initially ) bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs LA has experienced in the past . Being an action movie , it has its share of shoot-em-up scenes , blood , and guts . These scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable . Watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end - think of what you would typically expect in a good-cops / bad-cops conflict - and it bears little resemblance to a REAL police shoot-out . What irked me most was the way Timberlake 's character behaved during shoot-out scenes . He starts out having guns and not using them . Then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he 's been firing a gun his whole life . Then he runs out of bullets and doesn't have a gun - and 30 seconds later , without moving or anything - suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns AND extra ammo ? ! Little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me . If what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay , then you 'll probably love this movie . Personally , it doesn't matter to me what KIND of movie it is as long as it is realistic . Make me believe that the story is true . This story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that I came away feeling unsatisfied .  
  Your mind will not be satisfied by this nobudget doomsday thriller ; but , pray , who 's will ? A youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as Church people . Small _ apocalyptically themed outing , END OF THE WORLD has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely ' 50s similar movies . And it 's not only that , but EOTW plays like a hybridnot only doomsday but convent creeps as well . The villain of the movie is a wellknown character actor . This wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of conventexploitation , that significantly ' 70s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated . Anyway , the convent 's secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco ! Christopher Lee is the pride of End of the World ; but the End of the World is not at all his pride !  
  When I read the back of the DVD case , I thought that it sounded really interesting .. so .. I had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the " 4 for 20 dollars " section at Blockbuster . When we got home and popped in the movie .. twenty minutes into it , we found ourselves turning to each other going " this sucks . Let 's put in something else . " I 'll admit , a few of the lines from the friends at the café made us smile a little bit . But come ON , at least get some decent actors ! Every once in a while in a movie , if the acting is bad and the movie isn't going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting , I can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they 're over ( or under ) doing their lines . But I can only take so much . Crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter , there was no delivery for their lines .. amateur doesn't even come close to the acting in this film . Anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some REALLY good drugs while they were watching the movie . It 's the most pointless thing I 've ever had the displeasure of watching . DO NOT WATCH OR BUY THIS MOVIE !  
  I hate to sound like an ' old person ' , but frankly I haven't seen too many movies that I like that were made after 1960 .. generally , movies just seem to get worse and worse ( although I quite enjoyed the Scott Baio vehicle " The Bread , My Sweet " , except for the ' de rigeur ' sex scene which added NOTHING of value to THAT movie ) . This movie makes the mother , a former Las Vegas chorus girl , seem to be incapable of surviving on her own , although she is clearly in her 50s ( though hinted at being in her 40s ) . I didn't buy it . I 'm 57 and like all the women I know in their 50s and 40s , more than capable of surviving on my own ( as I have been doing since I graduated from high school at 13 , got legally emancipated and set off on my own life 's journey . ) The daughter is not believable in her job role .. she gets a promotion she doesn't deserve ( a great opportunity ) and drops that ball too , but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver , the writers shoot her down as an ' opportunist ' , when she was just doing what any career-oriented person would do - taking advantage of a wide-open opportunity created by the lack of self-discipline of her coworker , a girl who apparently doesn't understand the concept of honoring her promises ( to her boss , in this case ) . The daughter grudgingly ' allows ' her mother to stay with her , on a temporary basis , but then treats her mother ( the woman who gave her Life and raised her to ' adulthood ' ) like a pariah . Apparently the ' writers ' of tripe like this do not understand that it is NOT ' the common thing ' for PARENTS to act like children , and then be treated AS children by THEIR children . That is just more of the societal ' baloney ' that Hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we , their public , were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings . This is a sad movie with a stupid ending . If the young male restauranteur had been real and not a two-dimensional ' tv character ' , he 'd have stayed with the MOTHER , who was not that much older than him and quite attractive . But in the end he ' falls ' for the daughter , a shallow , rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth , but in an ordinary , bland way . ( The ' opportunist ' young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive , physically . ) There was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter ( who was an uptight , selfish , self-centered b * tch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect ) to the mother - a woman who was kindhearted , sweet-tempered , humorous , and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend . Of course the mother had her own flaws .. she had reacted to her husband 's demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter . Regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed , this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually LIKE baloney . ( Where 's the mustard ? )  
  I bought Bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago . I watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again . The excessive amount of watery ' blood ' at the beginning is just plain obsolete - not to mention the " whip-around " wind sounds . My friends and I made a super low budget movie , and the effects still exceeded this crap fest . As for the amount of mistakes in this movie , there are way too many to count . I knew one of the actors - believe it or not , he was my THEATRE teacher . HA ! Final verdict : Don't bother with this " horror " flick . 3 Stars ( out of a possible 73 )  
  It a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of Oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an Asian background does NOT EVEN SHOW ONE ASIAN OR AFRICAN person , not even as an extra . That fact probably describes Norwegian race relations in general . - However . NO SPOILERS - ONLY A BRIEF INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTION : Buddy portrays four young people living in a flat-share in Oslo . The protagonist are two young men that don't manage to direct their life in any serious fashion , and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility - a sort of fear of growing up . The narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models . Quite the cliché . Although the story is mildly funny , the acting is good and as a ' young person ' one can sort of identify with the characters ` crazy ' situations and complicated love affairs , I don't find the story or the characters very believable . To polished and lacking in depth . This film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as ` Friends ' ( yes that show on TV ) . Has Norwegian film finally found its identity ? : Audience pleasers in well known American style . How about watching Lukas Moodysson 's Tillsammans ( Together ) .  
  As someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true-life tale , I was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been . THE BAD - I 'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he has played , but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator . The dialog is insipid and the pretty Kathryn Harrold is real garbage-mouth . From what I read , there were several directors replacing each other on this film , and that 's too bad . You can tell things aren't right with the story . I couldn't get " involved " with Treat Williams ' portrayal of Cooper , either . He should have been fascinating , but he wasn't in this movie . It 's also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of " folk hero , " but I admit I wound up rooting for the guy , too . Not everything was disappointing . I can't complain about the scenery , from the lush , green forests of Oregon to the desert in Arizona . I 'd like to see this movie re-made and done better , because it is a one of a kind story .  
  Awful . This thriller should have buried . What a piece of crap . Terrible writing , characters are less than believable . Horrible Schlock ! Stick some B- stars in a terribly written POS to try and give it a little credit , but it fails miserably . If I didn't have to write ten lines about this movie I would have given it a word word review , it starts with ' sh ' and ends with ' it ' . Horrible ending , retarded . Who writes this crap . The ending of this film is so contrived , weak it 's as if they had no idea what to do with this story line , or they just ran out of money . Most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie . It 's a good thing that these actors are on the way out , because this would be a career killer . Good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it . At least no one important , like future investors . It could have ended a thousand different ways , but as it is , I feel cheated out of my precious time . Don't bother with this one , you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back .  
  One of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying , it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked . One of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they ( the yuppies ) are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art . While the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning , I find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner . If these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home , I would bet that American Psycho would be one of those movies .  
  This is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues . That is no exaggeration : you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it . I sincerely thought Fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does Erwin / Elvira suicides at the end , but instead of this , in every scene somebody is trying to explain : " when he was young , this happened .. " and " he just came back from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there .. " , etc . Soon in the movie , Erwin / Elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute ( certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat ) , and while telling her the story of Elvira 's life , Fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other . It is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying . Of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of " I have suffered much in my life , and am about to die " . In one of the sparse moments where actually happens something , Erwin / Elvira encounters a former lover , that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys ( as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality ) is that he recognizes Elvira . There are some interesting shots and ideas , I must admit ( such as when the nun tells the story of the young Erwin ) , but everything on the movie is wasted due to Fassbinder 's self - indulgence .  
  2 stars out of a possible 10 - and that is being overly generous . I thought with a cast of James Woods , Cathy Bates , Randy Quaid , Lou Gossett , Jr . , and Henry Thomas - how could it miss . I was wrong . I can only wonder what drugs Sam Shepard was on the week-end he cranked out this piece of dribble . I 'd long suspected Sam S . of being kind of nuts , this film , based on his play , confirms it . This is the kind of artsy b . s . that actors LOVE to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote . However , for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash , there is absolutely NOTHING to love about this movie . You haven't seen dysfunctional families until you 've seen this bunch . Pa is crazy , Ma is crazy , the son is crazy and the daughter is , oh yeah , crazy . They also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush , especially the teenage daughter . In addition to the above , as if that weren't enough , the plot-and it 's so thin you could read thorough it-has a hole in it the size of Alaska . Ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm . As it turns out so is Pa . Now I don't claim to be a real estate expert , but the last time I checked , property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold . If only one of them owned the property , then the other could not legally sell it , so it would be pointless for that person to do so . Mr . Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact , and therefore , his plot does not work . Not that anything else was really working anyway . The only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity , and I can't imagine why anyone would want to .  
  Horrible ending - and I can't believe Moore spent a year coming up with it . Smacks of L . Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs , which Hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks . This was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first 3.5 years . Now , the first 1.5 hours were action packed , though absurd in the premise , and then it deteriorated into a slow , painful , sophomoric dissolution of the series . Unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was . Were we to think more deeply ? If I wanted a lesson in a-materialism , I would reread Daniel Quinn 's Ishmael . Absurd to think 38K people would give up everything for a " fresh start " . Absurd to throw in a disappearing Kara , and a reappearing Baltar and Six . Absurd to throw in the Mitochondrial Eve . Just absurd .  
  The fight scenes were great . Loved the old and newer cylons and how they painted the ones on their side . It was the ending that I hated . I was disappointed that it was earth but 150k years back . But to travel all that way just to start over ? Are you kidding me ? 38k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise , they abandon technology ? No way . Sure they were eating paper and rationing food , but that is over . They can live like humans again . They only have one good doctor . What are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth .. yea right . No one would have made that choice .  
  I saw the 10p . m . showing and I must say that this movie was nothing special . Although I did not leave the theater wanting my time back ( as I don't actually pay for movies anymore ) I didn't really find any redeeming qualities . There were a few lines and such that made me chuckle , but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger ( in mind more than age as this film is rated R ) male audience . The fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well . I know you all want to hear Samuel L . say his infamous line , but let 's be honest , it 's a whole lot of hype for very little pay off . The only truly horrible part of the film was the CG , which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen . Now I am a reasonable man , I knew going into the theater that I wasn't going to be seeing " Casablanka , " and I am at least thankful that this film is an original ( albiet inane ) idea and not some re-make or franchise spin off . However to be honest , if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months .  
  This film had so much promise . I was very excited about this film . In the end , it was laughable at best , painful at worst . The acting styles ran the gamut from really , really , flat ( the angels , the wife and daughter ) to over-animated ( Casper 's character ) . I felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other . Pay special attention to the scene regarding " the bug " . It 's pretty much an insult to the audience 's ability to figure things out . In defense of that scene , though , it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie . I had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations . Too bad they didn't make use of it . I didn't feel like I was transported to exotic locations . Anybody could insert stock footage of the Coliseum in Rome . However , to end on a positive note , I thought the sets were pretty good . I really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers . It is my opinion ( and that 's all it is ) that if the SCHMALTZ factor would have been much much lower and the ACTION factor would have been greatly increased , this film would have been good .  
  Yes I admit I cried during this movie . It was so incredibly disappointing , that I couldn't help myself but cry . TBN ( Trinity Broadcasting Network ) has done it again . First with having the Million Dollar Man ( ex-professional wrestler ) on their program , and now this . The Omega Code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies . It was quite amusing , yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate . The movie follows what is known as " the bible code " rather than following actual biblical scripture . This film is extremely poorly made ; from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting . Its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie . It appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the USA channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie . I highly recommend you do not watch this movie , even if your life depended on it .  
  Quite honestly , The Omega Code is the worst movie I have seen in a very long time . During the first 30 minutes I sat stunned in my seat , trying to decide if I should demand a refund . But since I hadn't paid to see it in the first place ( passes ) , I figured I might as well stay . And I didn't think it could possibly get any worse . It did . I will quickly run through the low points ( includes some spoilers ) : The horrible miscasting of Casper Van Dien as Gillen Lane , a motivational speaker with two PhDs . The characterization was inconsistent ; for example , Lane , despite his credentials , is a complete nitwit . Then there 's the lame-o depiction of the fulfillment of the Biblical prophecies ; we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated Biblical Code . Also , terrible " action " sequences : Lane escapes from tough situations without explanation , and the one time Lane actually does seem to be in danger , it turns out to be a dream sequence ! That 's cute for grammar school writing assignments , but it 's an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture . The pacing was bad : after a long opener , the first third of the movie changes scenes every 90 seconds . Later , the pacing improves , but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around . And as someone else mentioned , years pass yet no one ( not even Lane 's young daughter ) ages . That was disconcerting . There are a few good things , though . The quality of the film ( e . g . lack of graininess ) is high and very attractive . The outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism . Also , there are a few moments in the last part of the film when Lane calls on God ( finally ) to help him - this proved to be quite exhilarating - even to me , someone who does not accept Jesus as a personal savior . But I liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie . Unfortunately , it was followed by major incomprehensibility . The characters , dialogue , direction and acting were ALL poorly done . Michael Ironside had nothing to do , and Michael York was just weird . I think the producers wanted to do too much ; if the plot had been tighter and more focused , and the characterization more fleshed out , the film would have been far better . In a nutshell , The Omega Code disappoints . Definitely do not pay to see this . I give it * out of ten stars .  
  I should have known I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as the lead character . Words cannot describe , nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was . But please allow me to try to describe it : Horrible acting , terrible dialog , corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force-fed the beliefs and propeganda from the Trinity Broadcasting Network . Its a weak attempt at trying to show Hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep , religious message attached to it . They failed miserably . It was clearly the worst movie I have seen in a long time .  
  The film is poorly casted , except for some familiar old Hollywood names . Other performances by unknown names ( i . e . , Jennifer Gabrielle ) are uninspiring . I have seen other films by this director , unfortunately this is one of his worst . Perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay ? In a positive note , Kim Bassinger 's and Pat Morita 's performance saved the movie from oblivion . I enjoyed Pat more in Karate Kid , though . There are many good movies to see , and in short , this one is not one of them . Save your money and the celluloid . Jason Vanness  
  I notice that the previous reviewer ( who appears to be still at school ) gave this movie a very good review and I can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn't seen the far superior 1989 BBC adaptation of this classic novel . The major problem I had with this ( 1999 ) version was the casting of Anthony Way as Tom Long . Anthony Way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the TV mini-series " The Choir " . I can only assume that he was cast for the role of Tom Long on the strength of his excellent acting in " The Choir " . Unfortunately the small boy who appeared in " The Choir " had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time " Tom 's Midnight Garden " was filmed and as such Anthony fails to convince as schoolboy Tom . It is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that Tom ( as played by Anthony ) would befriend the far younger Hatty . In the 1989 BBC version Tom and Hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable . For a 1999 movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the 1989 TV effects . The casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic . As a final observation I would point out that the VHS of the 1989 BBC version fetches well over £20.00 second hand whereas a new DVD of this version can be bought for under £5.00 , need I say more ?  
  OK me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b-movies since we do them ourselves . Anyway , the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff .. and Tom Savini ! There is just no way this movie can fail ! Right ? wrong ! It just seems like such a waste ! There was really no story , the dialog was terrible ( is anyone there ? x 1000 ! ) , the characters were .. well , they really lacked any kind of personality .. The effects were terrible .. and whats up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing .. with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff ? We were sitting the whole movie waiting for something .. anything to happen .. but no .. " oh , here comes the nymphs ! great ! oh .. they 're kissing .. again .. and now for the violence ! OK .. nothing really happens .. again .. oh , now they run around .. and the closeups of eyes .. again .. oh , heres Tom Savini ! Oh .. he died .. right .. OK , maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen .. no .. oh ! Cool ! a severed head ! the end .. oh crap .. " And finally , since i 'm so full of myself .. i 'll tell you this ! Give me a van , six actors , a weird looking house , Tom Savini , a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and i could make the coolest movie you 've ever seen .. I 've made movies with zero budget in two days that has better effects , better acting and a better script than this .. what is this Johannes guy doing ? Making cool movies is easy ! It could have been so great .. I 'm really upset !  
  This movie was so bad that my i . q . went down about 40 points after seeing it . It made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and think that it was worth it . It must of been some kind of personal favor to Van Damme .  
  You know Jason , you know Freddy , and you know Leatherface . Now , get ready for : The Safety Pin Killer ! That 's right , in Killer Workout , a dumb slasher movie if I 've ever seen one , the unseen murderer dispatches his ( or her ? ) victims with an oversized , novelty safety pin . It is an odd choice to be sure , the kind of thing that deserves an explanation . Naturally , the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing . As the title suggests , an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect . In fact , the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer , just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed . And since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead , it 's really just process of elimination . Oddly , while the entire name cast is killed off , the aerobics classes continue in earnest . In fact , nothing is capable of stopping the dancing . While three men are murdered in the next room , the workout goes on . Death isn't even a factor ; one character dies , but is still seen prominently in the later workout sessions . Director David Prior knew what he was doing when named the movie Killer Workout and not Logical Workout . Cop chases , explosive tanning beds , and hundreds of shots of women 's exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure . Much like the woman caught in the tanning bed , I felt very uncomfortable by the end of Killer Workout . Finally , thankfully , THE END flashed on the screen . What happened next ? You got it , shots of the women working out . Not even the end of the movie can stop them !  
  I am definitely a Burt Reynolds fan , but sorry , this one really stinks . Most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie . I can't believe he even made this one . Is he actually that hard up for money ?  
  This movie was like a bad indie with A-list talent . The plot was silly , all the way to the end . It reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the 1980 's . I would have given it a one , but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile . I think the worst thing was the underwater scene 's held off of the dock . The underwater lighting seemed to come from no were , and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air , this air tank would kind of appear . I would avoid this , unless there is nothing else on the shelf . Good Day .  
  SPOILERS AHEAD This is one of the worst movies ever made - it 's that simple . There is not one redeeming quality about this movie . The first 10 minutes are quite tricky - they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat . Instead , you will spend 83 minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization . The lake was ridiculous , looked like an aquarium , and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed . Characters show their advanced teleportation powers , for example Alex Thomas who falls into the lake ( drunk ) , and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position . Angie Harmon put up a pitiful performance as Kate , made worse by the space-time continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader . An example of this would be when she said , " Flashlight ! " in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half . Finally , the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that I have ever seen . It was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists . An example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on Alex 's car . I would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie . The ending was absolutely pathetic . The writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say , " oh yeah ! " Instead , we 're left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line . Unfortunately , there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crap . I give this a . 5 out of 10 , the . 5 being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book .  
  Some guy gets whacked . Right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him . He 's got some bodyguards and they whack the killer , but a reporter gets interested . She goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked . She walks in , and corners one bodyguard , but he doesn't feel like talking . I can't figure out why . It 's not like anyone else is interested . She 's the only reporter there . Anyway , her editor discourages her from working on this lame story . But hey , she does anyway . She goes to see the killer 's sister & mom . A few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time - somebody blows up their trailer - huge ball of fire . Then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital . She finds him hungover on his boat , but a minute later they 're both underwater sucking on a scuba tank ' cause three guys are trying to whack them ( and have blown up the boat big time - huge ball of fire ) . The reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them . In the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street , there 's a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse , some car chases with wreckage & death , a fake suicide , etc . etc . Lotsa stiffs , all kindsa carnage . Great stuff , but what the reporter and the bodyguard can't figure is : why in hell the original guy got whacked . What 's the motivation ? Of course , it might help us to figure out why the reporter 's even interested . Through almost all of this she 's the only reporter on the story . Nobody else in the media cares . Not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies . True , the original guy who got whacked wasn't exactly a celebrity . His job was a little bit dull . He was just the President . Yeah , the one who lives in the White House . Oh , and the bodyguard is a Secret Service agent . Is that the spoiler ? It should be . After all there are no TV cameras , no other print reporters , no bloggers .. just another one of those police blotter crimes .. So what 's the spoiler ? Lemme think .. No ! Wait ! The spoiler is that his wife did it ! Yeah .. the First Lady . She was p-ed because the President was fooling around . And she gets away with it . She 's really sharp , huh ? But how the hell could anybody ever figure that out ? Why would anyone bother ? After all , only one reporter is even interested . I give this move a " 1 " . It was so dumb I just had to keep watching . And it only got dumber ! That 's the real spoiler ! But even though I 've told you , you 've got to see it to believe it !  
  Dialogue : stilted , clichéd ; Acting : hammy , clichéd ; Plot : predictable , clichéd . Just what are Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski doing in this " B " rubbish ? Plummer was well established decades before this movie was made , Kinski had masterpieces like " Tess " and " Cat People " behind her .. Must have been desperate . The bad guys all have bad-guy accents - * bad * bad-guy accents ! ( Plummer especially ! Where * did * he learn to do " German " ? ) and most of them have bad-guy sneers as well . The innocent bystanders all overdo their panicking enough to make you laugh . The good guy survives , amongst other things : * a 5 " throwing knife buried hilt-deep in his shoulder - just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at all ; * marines ' machine-gun fire ( I think someone referred to a . 50 ) in the leg which he sorts out by tying a bandage around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp ; * several fist-fights in which he sustains multiple punches to the face as well as being run cranium-first into a door frame ; * a fall , backwards , from what looks like the third floor , onto paving , without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience . The script has exactly 3 clever lines , the rest of the time it 's all so dull and boring . OK it 's not all bad . Plummer does bring a certain class to his part , and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick . Of course that doesn't say much , but he can do the callous villain without resorting to the ham techniques most of the villains use here . He delivers his " Ve haff vays and meance " type lines with some menace , but you are always aware you are watching Christopher Plummer acting the villain . This movie is truly an awful waste of time . The acting , such as it is , is sort of 70 's 007 movies wooden line delivery meets Bruce Lee 's very obviously faked fight scenes , but it 's not even anywhere near as good as either a Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee film . Don't bother .  
  Film starts with 3 people meeting each other in the bar . OK . They 're talking about their imaginary lives , lying all the time , with no reason . Still OK . From time to time , they even make you laugh . Interesting . First 30 minutes you actually enjoy it ! But then .. things become worse .. Nothing 's happening .. for a long time .. and then , when something happen , all you can see are naked old " ladies " touching each other ! Not OK . Disgusting ! By the way , this part should be the top of the movie , but it 's everything except that ! Movie has no point , it 's boring , and sick ! The strangest thing is that here ( Belgrade , Serbia ) on FEST ( film festival ) , this movie was the most popular according to researches , of course , before people watched it ! I even thought ( before watching ) : " Hay , this might be interesting , although it 's a Russian movie " ! But , God , No !  
  It was disgusting and painful . What a waste of a cast ! I swear , the audience ( 1/2 full ) laughed TWICE in 90 minutes . This is not a lie . Do not even rent it . Zeta Jones was just too mean to be believable . Cusack was OK . Just OK . I felt sorry for him ( the actor ) in case people remember this mess . Roberts was the same as she always is . Charming and sweet , but with no purpose . The " romance " with John was completely unbelievable .  
  What a pathetic movie . I won't waste much time commenting about it . I 'm still trying to get back the couple hours I wasted on it . Let me leave it simply with - Shaq has NO BUSINESS being an actor or singer . He is utterly without talent at both discplines . It 's a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut CDs . Much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no-talent that is Shaq .  
  What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking ? Was Hollywood responsible for this travesty , or can I take comfort in the idea that someone who didn't speak English as a first language just completely missed the point of Charlotte Bronte 's classic ? I don't think I can improve on a comment I read below , so I 'll just paraphrase it : " Jane Eyre is a great great book , the screenwriter should read it sometime . " It 's true that this movie 's two leads were sadly miscast . But pity the actors , because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes . The dialog that makes you understand the Jane and Rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun .. deleted from the script . The marriage proposal , the fortune teller .. gone . The allusions , half joking , half sincerely felt , to Jane as a fairy sprite from olde England come to rescue Rochester in his despair .. eliminated . It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and Jane 's interactions with the Rivers family . But it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written . Do yourself a favor and go find the 1983 ( ? ) mini series with Timothy Dalton .  
  What 's up with Robert " Pretentious " Altman ? Was he saving on lighting ? Everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable . I mean , have you ever seen a lawyer 's office where everyone works by candlelight ? Don't waste your time . In fact , don't waste your time with anything Altman makes : It 's all a pretentious waste of film .  
  When I saw that Mary Louise Parker was associated with this epic novel turned film , I was intrigued . Being a fan of the book , I assumed she 'd be playing Tony , Roz , or Charis , but more so , I was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head-y , almost psychological ( but not psychological thriller ) novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who hadn't read the novel , and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had . The book is a complex reflection of society , women , and modern life , and I was interested to see how they used the 3 different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film . What they actually did was a crime . The biggest error and confusing issue is : Why would Oxygen , a network that advertises as being for women , take an amazing book about how complex , wonderful , and terrible women are and can be , and change the protagonist from 3 women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story ? It seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask Roz , Tony , and Charis about how they knew Zenia and in doing that , they rushed through bulk of the book . In doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it , aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with . In the film , these women aren't people , they are characters . In the book Zenia does fake her death , but the book mentions it to get this point across , while the film wastes 30-45 minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use . They tried to make this complex book an episode of Law and Order or CSI . It turns out that Mary Louise Parker played Zenia , which was SO wrong . Zenia is a Catherine Zeta-Jones , Angelina Jolie , or maybe even a Scarlett Johnasson type . She is a woman men can't not adore , and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by , but in a " keep your enemies closer " kind of way . And once she gets closer , she seems totally genuine and trust worthy , despite your better judgment . She 's the kind of woman who , even when she loses , she wins : she 's always still beautiful , still rich , and there are always still people out there who don't know her game . In the film , Zenia didn't take Charis 's man ( the blonde American draft dodger who was using Charis in the first place .. ) but instead took August and tried to become her legal guardian ( and apparently came back to be her Lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies ) . And Zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with August , but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed . It 's was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book , but I think had I not read the book , I would have spent the whole movie confused , if I had bothered to stick with it at all . And Roz 's husband was dead before Zenia came in to the picture ( which was weird since Zenia took Roz 's business AND home life in the book , which is why Roz hated her so much ) and she and Zenia had conspired to kill Roz 's husband years and years back . And according to the film Tony and West had been dating forever .. even at the party where Zenia and West ( in the book ) had painted the whole place black and they made Tony seem like this totally with it ( and evil , bitchy ) person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it . Tony 's character was SO wrong in this film .. she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky , mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book . The film basically implied smart women are evil , beautiful women are evil , powerful women are evil , and women who teach yoga are off their rockers . They basically tried to make it so Zenia wasn't necessarily as awful as she was in the book , and then , in the end , the three women convince this former cop ( who , of course in the process of researching this , meets Zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to Barbados or something ridiculous , which of course Zenia bails on ) to hide Zenia 's body ( which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at , but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony , or they conspired together to do it .. ) and then Zenia also managed to take all of Roz 's money in the process . By the end of the film I was only half paying attention between commercials b / c it had spiraled so far out in space from what it could and should have been . If you aren't confused by this breakdown of the film , then maybe you would like it , because I have read the book and seen the movie , and from the movie alone I am ridiculously confused . It was terrible . I get that making a film out of that book is quite a task , but if you are going to take on the task , you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary , instead of creating some useless character to be our Alice in wonderland . Are there really no fluffier books that Oxygen could be making at least half decent TV movies of ?  
  Hawked as THE MOST OFFENSIVE MOVIE EVER , GUARANTEED TO OFFEND EVERYONE - Guess what ? It worked , I 'm offended that we shelled out money to rent this . Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on TV was true . Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us ! It was by far the worst movie I 've seen since Hollow Man . I generally avoid the crappy ones , but got sucked into this one . We have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it , and his movie picking privileges have been revoked . There is nothing remotely funny about this movie .. even the " adventures of dickman " scene was sophomoric at best .. Color me p * ed . Thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason .. no .. it just sucked . NEVER WATCH THIS ! for any reason whatsoever . Not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny . That 's saying ALOT . Please for the love of all that is holy , if you cherish your sanity - never view this movie . It 's many things - stupid , pointless , and worthless to name a few . But the main thing it was aiming for : offensively funny - it failed miserably . Crash and burn ..  
  In its way , Mister Foe ( originally , and more appropriately , titled Hallam Foe  I can't see addressing its title character as " mister " ) , is a tribute to good acting . Both Jamie Bell , as Hallam , a physically attractive voyeur / creep , and Sophia Myles , as Kate , his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance , are convincing . The problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life . A young man who spies on the intimate details of people 's lives the way Hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp . And a woman in Kate 's situation would be repulsed and frightened - she would probably call the police . These things are not , however , what happens in the movie . Poor Hallam 's mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he 's been having an affair . Hallam , of course , hates his stepmother and lets he know it . She has sex with him . Kate 's some kind of an employment person who places Hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games . She looks like his birth mother . It all ends happily with Hallam " resolving " his " issues " . Forty some years ago , the play and brilliantly acted movie , Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf , had a similarly optimistic ending , with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart . The trouble is , it doesn't always work that way , especially when nobody really cares . In Virginia Woolf , the ending 's plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation . In Mister Foe , the emotional revelation never really happens .  
  This flick reminded me of those lame " erotic thrillers " I used to stay up late and watch on Cinemax when I was 13 . I 'd label this flick softer-core since there is just no simulated bump and grinder . There is , however , a ton of nudity - the opening scene is in a strip club , we see Kane Hodder 's keester ( or at least a stunt butt ) and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the Munster 's for a costume . 13 year old boys rejoice . Other than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI I 've seen in years . The shots look like FMV 's from the video game Resident Evil in terms of quality . The wolf is too bad to be explained and , despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way , way too many times . The plot and acting make no sense . There is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybrid-werewolves - the Darkwolf is the latter but from what I can tell hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do - look human , change to a wolf an kill people . The Darkwolf is trying to find a mate but oddly can't find the mate but can sniff out anyone she touches . Once more , this skills proves less than useful since the Darkwolf winds up killing several folks his target never touched , met or even saw as best I can tell . The mate doesn't know she 's a werewolf and she 's fighting the transformation or something . You 'd think it 'd be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but , well they did . Want quality low-end werewolf-ism , go rent Dog soldiers want a ton of T & A this is your flick .  
  In the bygone days of the Catholic Church , a sin-eater was an individual that , through ritual , would take the sins of a dying person upon themselves . Often , these people were excommunicate or similar individuals who the church would not absolve , thereby denying them entrance into Heaven . The sin-eaters were seen as blasphemous , circumventing the chruch 's monopoly on redemption . Sex this up a bit with some overt supernatural mojo , let the concept wander where it may , and you have " The Order " , a movie that combines " Stigmata " ' s religious anti-authoritarianism , " The X-Files " ' paranormal investigation , and " The Thorn Birds " ' sexual spirituality into an odd melange that sometimes works . Alex ( Heath Ledger ) is a rogue priest , one of the last members of the Order of the Carolingians , a semi-heretical order of knowledge-seeking , demon-fighting priests . When Alex 's mentor is found dead under bizarre circumstances , Bishop Driscoll ( Peter Weller ) sends Alex to investigate . Tagging along are fellow Carolingian Thomas ( Mark Addy ) and Mara ( Shannyn Sossman ) , who was subject to one of Alex 's exorcisms a year prior . The three go to Rome to investigate and are drawn into a dark underworld of bizarre Catholic heresy , ominous prophecies , demonic intrusions , and a man claiming to be the last surviving Sin-Eater ( Benno Furmann ) . Written and directed by Brian Helgeland ( who worked with the same principals on the scattershot and half-hearted " A Knight 's Tale " ) , the film is an odd one , and difficult to classify . It wants to be several things at once - supernatural thriller , religious intrigue , dramatic television pilot - and only sometimes succeeds at any of them . This isn't helped by the slow pace or the fact that most of the actors seem to be sleepwalking through their performances with occasional bursts of brilliance . Ledger , in particular , has a particularly stunning scene of despair in an otherwise monochromatic performance . Sossman , however , displayed the same disconnected performance that she 's given in all of her films ( most notably in " The Rules Of Attraction " ) . The plot itself meanders back and forth between several different story arcs , leading you to wonder which is the main one with each arc containing its share of red herrings . Large gaps of narrative appear to be lost between scenes at times , which can be confusing for many , but this is also one of the film 's saving graces . The structure of the film - coupled by the fact that there is never a truly clear antagonist until the very end of the film - forces the viewer to analyze and reason in a time when most films are blatantly obvious about everything ( the exception to this is historical background on the Carolingians and the practice of sin-eating , both of which are explained in dry exposition ) . Even at the beginning of the film , character relationships and history are inferred instead of explained . Combine this with the on-location shooting and judicious use of special effects , and you have a very old-world supernatural thriller , with even the opening credits reminiscent of something from the late 70 's / early 80 's . A brief mention here , as well , for the subtle and organic score by David Torn , a combination of minimalist orchestration and Lisa Gerrard-style exotic vocals . A very nice score that is evocative without being bombastic and exists in a very deceptive simplicity . A confusing plot , a lack of purpose , and sometimes sleepy performances would often damn a movie , but for some reason , " The Order " remains watchable . Many people will be very turned off by the movie for its odd sensibilities , and some may even become angry that they are forced to engage the higher functions of their brain to understand it . Still , the film 's sheer intangibility will prevent it from being either a critical or commercial success until the DVD , which I 'm sure will be stocked with copious amounts of deleted scenes . A recommended film only for people who like to think while they watch . 6 out of 10 .  
  OK .. I watch a lot of bad movies . I pride myself on that fact . many times there are some gems in the B rated bombs . But this movie is one of the worst I have watched . I like a good horror movie .. but one with a plot of and sense of movement . The opening scenes seemed pretty good . Decent music and imagery . Then it goes down hill from there . One of the main characters has a disability ( Ringing in the Ears called Tinnitus ) . Now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret . They made that too much of a focus of the movie . So what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he shouldn't have been . No need to keep bringing it up . So this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table . So instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body . Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her . Well after seeing her sister over and over again ( as a zombie like ghost ) and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her . Now the body is recovered and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her . Bad thing is that she didn't have much of a plan . Only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped . The idiot didn't even believe he killed her . So all is revealed there and even though she had a gun .. somehow she manages to get herself strangled . So the last scenes of the movie are of the " spirits " of her and her twin walking out of the water . So you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins . And not one but two innocent people die . Good things about the movie : imagery Bad things about the movie : music sound effects long and drawn out misdirection of plot low grade acting from some not all actors  
  This movie was way over-hyped . A lot of the viewers , who thought this was " amazing " must have been into the old school movies , cause the whole movie is set in the past . At first I thought the movie was just showing something from the past , so I was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass , but it just going . Basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past , and the 2 don't mix very well in this movie , even with special effects . You could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with . There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did , so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying " it 's the greatest movie ever done " . It 's just crap on a stick . It also didn't help that the story line was soo crappy . I don't understand why Hollywood agreed to have this movie produced , and I also don't understand how actors / actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this . It 's almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print .. " It will all be done on a computer " . This was a movie that should have been on a movie network , because nothing about this movie was revolutionary . I 'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this . Whatever you do , don't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow .  
  What a waste of time ! I 've tried to sit through ' Sky Captain .. " about 6 times , and every time , within about 3 minutes , I start doing something else - anything else ! It 's a downright boring movie , the acting is terrible , the writing dull , and obviously a first-time director , because it 's stiff . And I wanted to love it . I love sci-fi , the old cliffhangers , and I can appreciate the attempt at nods to Flash Gordon , and Metropolis , but my God , what a waste of money . I used to work for Paramount Pictures , and I had written Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests . She told me they 'd never have an interest or need to do it . 10 years later , Paramount releases this piece of crap . Sherry was right in 1993 , but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog . Blue screen an effect shot , but not an entire movie . Let 's not forget , neither Jude nor Jolie are terrific actors ( but easy on the eyes ) . Paltrow 's performance reminds me of a high school effort . Too bad - it could 've worked , but only under a skilled director . the funny thing is , Sky Captain 's director will keep getting work , even after this dreck . It 's commerce , not art !  
  This is a film that had a lot to live down to . on the year of its release legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst film of the year and I 'd heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was criticised for being too complicated To be honest the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word " plot " is used because as far as I can see there is no plot as such . There 's something involving Russian gangsters , a character called Pete Thompson who 's trying to get his wife Sarah pregnant , and an Irish bloke called Sean . How they all fit into something called a " plot " I 'm not sure . It 's difficult to explain the plots of Guy Ritchie films but if you watch any of his films I 'm sure we can all agree that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing . Likewise a James Bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes . You will have a serious problem believing RANCID ALUMINIUM has any type of central plot that can be cogently explained Taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bells as to what sort of film you 'll be watching . Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made in the last 15 years and she 's doing nothing to become inconsistent . Steven Berkoff gives acting a bad name ( and he plays a character called Kant which sums up the wit of this movie ) while one of the supporting characters is played by a TV presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it 's utterly forgettable . I saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching I was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching , but by now I 've mainly forgotten why . But this doesn't alter the fact that I remember disliking this piece of crap immensely  
  William S . Hart ( as Jim Treen ) , the most eligible bachelor in Canyon City , is finally getting hitched , to pretty blonde waitress Leona Hutton ( as Molly Stewart ) . His fiancée doesn't know it , but Mr . Hart is secretly the western town 's " Most Wanted " bandit . However , Hart is planning to go straight , due to his marriage plans . Unfortunately , Ms . Hutton discovers Hart 's secret stash , whilst cleaning up his untidy cabin ; so , she calls off the wedding . Next , Hutton succumbs to the charms of mining swindler Frank Borzage ( as W . Sloane Carey ) . Serviceable entertainment from superstar Hart ; he was ranked no less than # 1 at the box office , by Quigley Publications , for the years 1915 and 1916 ( ahead of Mary Pickford ) . The principles perform capably . Later on , Frank Borzage was quite a director ; and Leona Hutton , a suicide .. * A Knight of the Trails ( 8/20/15 ) William S . Hart ~ William S . Hart , Leona Hutton , Frank Borzage  
  As long as there 's been 3d technology , ( 1950 's I think ) there 's been animation made for it . I remember specifically , a Donald Duck cartoon with Chip and Dale in it . I don't remember the name at the moment , but the plot was that Donald worked at a circus , was feeding an elephant peanuts and Chip and Dale were stealing the peanuts . This was made to watch in 3d probably 1960 's . If you happened to watch Meet the Robinsons in 3d in theaters , they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of it 's origin . There are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made specifically to be viewed through 3d glasses . This claim was a bad move because it 's not difficult to prove them wrong . On top of that , this just looks like a bad movie .  
  This story is about the romantic triangle between a nth . African male prostitute , a French transsexual prostitute ( Stephanie ) and a Russian waiter who speaks no French and never seems to shave . As a film it is dull , dreary and depressing , shot either on foggy , overcast winter days or in badly lit interiors , where everyone is bathed in a weird blue luminescence . And yes , I know , it 's because the white balance was out . Everyone is pale and downcast and looks haggard , shabby and dirty . Bodies are bony and shot in such closeup that they look quite ugly and unappealing . Moles , greasy hair . Yuk . Bad news in a film where people spend a lot of time either naked or having sex . And the story ? Well , Stephanie 's mother is dying . All three characters go back to Stephanie 's home village where , through a bunch of flashbacks to desolate countryside and predictably dingy interiors , we see a bit of Stephanie 's childhood as a boy called Pierre . The mother dies . Well .. and that 's about it , really . Character development is kept to a minimum , as is the denouement of the story . I suppose the storyline is not linear ( it would explain a lot of non sequiteurs ) but really , after paying my seven euros I don't feel like having to construct the film myself : that 's what the director takes my money for . To expect me to join the story telling process and get my hands dirty , so to speak , is asking way too much . This film is a heap of pretentious rubbish made , above all , from a desire to epater les bourgeois ( ie shock the straights ) . I can see how it was a shoo-in for the Berlin Film Festival , and I can see why it got nowhere .  
  Oh , for crying out loud , this has got to be the LAMEST movie I 've seen all year , and I 'm sorry the normally awesome John Cusack was even involved in this brainless , twitty piece of Stupidity . Where Sleepless in Seattle delivered what amounts to be the same message , albeit on a more subtle , somewhat more mature level , Serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer , and then proceeds to pound it into your psyche for the next tedious hour and a half or so ( and that 's an hour and a half of my life I 'll never get back again , thank you very much ! ) . It 's bad enough the main characters of this movie have the emotional maturity level of fourteen-year-olds ( actually I 've known better fourteen-year-olds .. ) , except maybe for Jeremy Piven , who was enjoyable enough . Just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie where Kate Beckinsale 's character plays that annoying silliness of a game about throwing all sensibility to the wind ( literally ) had my best friend and I irritated beyond belief . I told my husband Rockstar had more intelligence , and at least , the characters in Rockstar weren't half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this " Serendipitous " mess . It 's annoying to watch protagonists who seem to have no clue about choice in their lives , and feel they 're nothing more than puppets to destiny and the whims of fate . How utterly tiresome . I 'm sure this movie will be more likely enjoyed by those who 'd rather not engage in the chaotic messiness of making more complex life choices and then responsibly living with the consequences . After all , here 's a movie where our hero and heroine live happily ever after only after wreaking havoc and misery on two other people 's lives ( namely their respective fiancées ) , not to mention other relatives and friends , just to get there .  
  If there has ever been a worse comedy than ' Gray Matters ' I am unaware of it . The New York Jewish comedy 's ' funny ' premise is that siblings Sam & Gray are mistaken for a couple and so decide to fix Sam up with a girlfriend , only to find that Gray is equally attracted to their target - Charlie . The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is apparently only a surprise to her . There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence , a deeply embarrassing ' drunk act ' from Moynahan and Graham , and a performance that would embarrass forests everywhere for its woodenness from Tom Cavanagh . Sissy Spacek demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and will want this excised from her resume . Molly Shannon plays the homely friend with lumpen insouciance . Only Alan Cumming emerges with any credit but is seriously under-employed and given nothing with which to work . The whole disaster is cemented by Graham 's bizarre eye-rolling performance culminating with the penultimate scene where she wears a comedy hat and an overcoat despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar . It is astonishing that this film was ever released it has no redeeming feature and should be avoided at all costs .  
  It was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the Chick Flick audience , to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most . However , this was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan ( who became annoying as hell in her own right ) . Her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles . This film might have been more , as there was suitable budget for settings , actors and a decent story line . My wife and I both agreed that this was ' Muck ' at the end , as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high ! Better luck next time , hope Miss Graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like From Hell .  
  I have been familiar with the fantastic book of ' Goodnight Mister Tom ' for absolutely ages and it was only recently when I got the chance to watch this adaption of it . I have heard lots of positive remarks about this , so I had high hopes . Once this film had finished , I was horrified . This film is not a good film at all . ' Goodnight Mister Tom ' was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4.5/10 of the book was missed out . Particularly , I found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this . There was not much dialogue , It was rushed and far too fast-moving , but I was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between William Beech and Tom in this film which was a true let down . The casting was not all that good , either . I thought this could have been really good , but it was so different to the book ! Anextremely poor adaption , one of the worst I 've seen . This deserves a decent remake that 'd better be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage .  
  It 's getting worse , the series is on a serious down fall . The first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a buch of really , really terrible movies . Robert Englund gives another great performance as Freddy but the rest of the cast can't act . The story is Alice , having survived the previous installment of the Nightmare series , finds the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger starting once again . This time , the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of Alice 's unborn child . His intention is to be " born again " into the real world . The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother , but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her own son ? Check out the first three , miss the next three then watch the last one .  
  " The Dream Child " of 1989 is the fifth film in the ( generally overrated ) " Nightmare " series , and at the latest from this point on , the series became total garbage . The only good films in the series were Wes Craven 's 1984 original , and the third part , " The Dream Warriors " of 1987 . The second part was disappointing and boring , and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman Freddy Krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes . This fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for ( admittedly great ) visuals , and one creepy scene , a flashback sequence to how Freddy Krueger came into existence . The rest of the film consists mainly of our razor-clawed maniac-turned-jokester yelling stupid one-liners , and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses , who desperately try to avoid falling asleep , because good old Freddy awaits them in their dreams . Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson , and a bunch of uninteresting crap , such as a super-dumb ' eerie ' children 's rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel .. In Short : No originality , just a decline of the old formula , and an over-load of painfully annoying jokes . My ( generous ) rating of 3/10 is due to the great visuals , and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel , " Freddy 's Dead " , which is awful beyond belief . In case you 're not a hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiast , " The Dream Child " should be avoided , and even if you are , this is more than likely to disappoint .  
  Given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness ( 81 minutes - including end credits , so roughly 76 minutes of actual film ) . But what it cannot explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed . The gags are quick and sometimes not even funny . The only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the Nike basketball spots , James Woods ' portrayal of Max Van Sydow 's character in the Exorcist , and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film . Very unfunny was the take off of Charlie 's Angels , which like the first Scary Movie and the Matrix spin off scene , basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it . Today 's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70 's such as the Exorcist and maybe of the 80s ' Poltergeist , et . al . Hopefully Scary Movie 3 will take some time to put together , making the spoofs more enjoyable . One thing though , the film features more than the last one of promising young actress Anna Faris ( whom I will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel ) . Just for her casting and acting ability , I give this movie a " 3 " out of " 10 " .  
  This stuffy melodrama is quite easily the worst film starring Ingrid Bergman that I 've seen . Even her luminous screen presence can't save this insufferably slow and meandering movie that 's nearly impossible to sit through without fast-forwarding a lot of it . Only for die-hard Bergman fans ; others are very likely to fall asleep . I suggest you to watch " For Whom the Bell Tolls " instead .  
  There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer : actress Nichole Hiltz . She is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge . Directed by Simon Gornick , the film stars Joyce Hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her cheatin ' spouse . Oh , but not by conventional means . She plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl Nichole Hiltz as her weapon of choice . She wants Nichole ( as Tuesday ) to get close to her ex ( the handsome but dull Stephan Jenkins , who should stick to music ) to embarrass him and ruin his life . David DeLuise is good in his few brief moments , and former " Crime Story " star Anthony Dennison is given virtually nothing to do but scowl . Hiltz on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful , then evil and devious . She also handles vulnerable and " maybe a bit psychotic " well . She 's also quite hot ( though there 's no naughty bits show ) so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she is aimed at . But the performance is kind of wasted in this movie , which is just not edgy or interesting enough to recommend .  
  I had somewhat high hopes for this since I like Tim Roth . I was not pleased with this film . I liked the Ang Lee The Hulk a few years back so I figured this would have more of a bang to it . First I was very disappointed with John Hurt 's performance here . He looks as if his eyebrows were re-shaped for this . His performance was not convincing . He was not as good as one would expect . Tim Roth is cool as always here . The Gama thing didn't really stick to the original story line I don't think . I guess the best part of the film was the end . It had some cool action . The only problem with the original was that it was too long . This one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times . I remember some time ago when Walmart had this movie really cheap for sale and I always wondered why ? . Now I know . I was hoping to to get blown away , but I was not .  
  ' P ' ( or Club-P ) should really be called ' L ' for lame . Every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its much-hyped logline : " Thai lesbians fighting monsters . " Rather , this is the tale of a Khmer country girl who 's grandmother has taught her a little witchcraft along with a few odd ( but specific ) rules : " don't walk under a clothesline , " " don't eat raw meat , " and " don't accept money for your powers . " Well , guess what folks , the girl moves to Bangkok to raise some money as a ' bar-girl ' and manages to break all the rules granny taught her which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the ' foreign johns ' who pay for her services . While this film can't even be released in Thailand due to it 's controversial subject matter most American audiences will find this ho-hum horror pic a cross between " Showgirls " and " Interview with the Vampire " as directed by Walt Disney . If not for a few scenes with significant amounts of blood the MPAA could probably rate this for pre-teens only . There is literally broadcast TV adult fare , although you 'd expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a Thai porn star in real life . As for the ' lesbian ' angle , there 's one brief smooch and a couple of " I love you 's " to prove that the two main stars really are a couple ( on brother ) . And the P-bar has got to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs on and do carnival stunts ( there 's a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girl 's mouth .. ooh , phallic imagery ) . NO nudity , NO real monster ( unless you count a five foot high Thai spirit with yellow eyes ) , and no way any ADULT should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on DVD . You 've been warned !  
  Bought this movie in the bargain bin at Rogers Video store for $ 2 . I enjoy a good B movie now and then and figured this looked like a good one . The movie is quite cliche " 1970 's " and is quite groovy for that . Unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie . In fact , I turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and figured a week later that I should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was . The movie has good spots in it , but you have to wait and wait and wait .. for them . If you are into B movies , this might just be for you , just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens , and did I mention not much story line either ..  
  This movie is little more than poorly-made , fetish porn , and this is saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made in that era . This was recommended to me by friend as a " unique film experience . " He was right . I suppose he meant that as a joke . Not disgusting , not even that shocking . Just mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock art . A little bit of camp value , though I don't believe the makers of this film intended this . And yes , as a previous reviewer mentioned , it 's sex with a guy in a bear suit . Don't spend a lot of money on this . Try to borrow it , if you must see it . Or contact me , I 'd be happy to sell you my copy for half price . I may have to see another of this particular director 's films , as he seems to have a certain following . But if it 's anything like this , I will again regret another 2 hours of my life gone forever .  
  This is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron . The acting is second rate . Poor Mathew Modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film . And god help Gina Gershon . Her accent is too over the top . It sounds nothing like an true English woman . It sounds forced and phony , much like her acting . She should stick to what she does best , lesbian showgirl con-artist who plays in a rock & roll band and has a drug problem . The other characters are no better . They are two dimensional . empty , vapid and silly . How are we to supposed to care about these people . At one point Christy Scott Cashman get 's lost in Central Park . Really ? It 's not that hard to navigate Central Park . Just follow any path out . Not only did I not care about ANY of the characters , I downright hated them . The only reason I even stayed with this train-wreck of a film was Fisher Stevens . Even his brilliant humor couldn't save this dying Fish . Each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us . The script was awful as was the acting . If you catch this Fish throw it back !  
  I didnt think it was possible , but i have found film worse than ' Body Melt ' . This film is really really bad ! And what makes it worse is that its another Australian film .. Shot on what looks like VHS , and with a terrible 80 's rock soundtrack , it just keep getting worse and worse , which is hard to believe seeing how bad the beginning is ( skinned male hanging up-side-down in a white tomato sauce sprayed room anyone ? ) . And why do their accents keep changing ? From bad New York drawl , to prissy english , then pure Aussie ! And it happens to the whole cast ! This film also claims to have won some film festival on the cover ( i believe it was the Utah Film Festival ) . This has to be a lie because no-one in their right mind would nominate this for anything ( perhaps the Golden Rasberries but i thinks its too bad for that aswell ) . Come on guys ! This film has to be number 1 on the bottom 100 ! It has to be ten times a bad as those films already on there . Well done to the " film " makers of this trash , for proving there is a reason not to see films .. 0/10  
  After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep , I decided that I may as well be entertained while I suffered from sleep deprivation . This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it . What a mistake ! Here is the plot ( potential spoilers , if you even care ) : a neurotic man with an addiction to candy ( Josh Kornbluth ) works as a temp for some ridiculous company . Suddenly , he is offered the chance to " go perm , " which seems to be the favorite catch-phrase of this movie . But with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp , Josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he doesn't want to do it . He hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt . His inability to send several " very important " letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious , but is merely stupid . Josh meets and deceives a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together ( obviously a fantasy of Josh 's in real life , as such a thing would never happen ) . A bunch of other stuff happens , but it 's too trite and inane to go into now . Despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy , I only laughed twice during it ; the first time was the opening shot of Josh Kornbluth ( my initial reaction was one of stifling fear ) and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman ( yeah , right ) . Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying-looking person I have ever seen in my life . He is an unattractive , overweight , balding Jewish man who I am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women . I do not at all sympathize with Josh 's character . He is lazy and unmotivated and I just don't appreciate the failed attempts at humor . Skip it , even if your life depends upon it .  
  William Lustig 's followup to " Maniac " proves conclusively that , without Tom Savini 's spectacular effects and Spinell 's convincing performance , " Maniac " would never have become the cult hit that it did . " Vigilante " is badly directed , with a simple-minded script that spells everything out for you and is predictable at every turn , and also mediocre performances by all the actors . Judging from the sense of " deja vu " this film gave me , Lustig had watched " Death Wish " several times too many before making this ! ( * 1/2 )  
  Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel . I don't know how he came up with this film ! The idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of American Society is hopeful , that makes it 2 out of ten . But this is not a movie . Is that the best someone can do with a great idea ( the west-east clash ) . There are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a MAC * with the fingers of an Amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity ( because she is just ignorant about the facts ) . The characters are not well shaped . And the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me . At the ending scene Lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen . And the background music says " .. I will pray " . The thing is not about religion actually . But it ends up with this . How you are gonna see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray . The lights are already shining on the truth . Its just that nobody wants to see it . ps : " My home is not a place . It is people " The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence . But it is wasted behind this film making . ( by the way ; as " someone " mentioned below , Americas finest young man are not finest , they are just the " poor " and the " hopeless " ones who sign up for the army in need of good paychecks which is not provided by the government ! )  
  The End of Violence and certainly the Million Dollar hotel hinted at the idea the Wenders has lost his vision , his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture . The Land of Plenty seals the coffin , I 'm afraid , by being a vastly unimaginative , obviously sentimental and cliché 'd film . The characters are entirely flat and stereotyped , the writing , plot and direction are amateurish , at best . For the first time in quite a while , I was impatient for the film to end so I could get on with my life . The war-torn delirium of the uncle , the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusion .. it all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic , hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen . What happened ? The days of experimentation , perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him , I 'm afraid . Let 's hope he finds his inspiration again .. At the Toronto film festival , which is where I saw the film , Wenders was there to introduce it . Completely lacking in humility , he offered us the following : " I hope .. no , wait .. I KNOW you 're going to enjoy the next two hours . " I 'm afraid he couldn't be more wrong ..  
  Weak Bobby " Pineapple Salsa " Flay and Mario Batali bring this down . Flay being the worst . Definitely a one trick pony , I think they could have gotten other American chefs to come to the table on this one as the Iron Chefs . The kind of dishes this duo come up with really .. don't reflect on the creativity of the original Iron Chef Series . I don't think Batali even went to chef school , actually . There are a lot of great chefs in America , I just wonder why they don't appear on the Food Network . It would also help to have more regional ingredients and perhaps co-hosts who can handle the pressure . I like Alton Brown , but he is a bit too flippant / funny for this role .  
  I sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn't take anymore . It felt as though I 'd watched dozens of episodes already , and then it hit me .. There 's nothing new here ! I 've heard that joke on Seinfeld , I saw someone fall like that on friends , an episode of Happy Days had almost the same storyline , ect . None of the actors are interesting here either ! Some were good on other shows ( not here ) , and others are new to a profession they should have never entered . Avoid this stinker !  
  Horrendous pillaging of a classic . It wasn't written convincingly at all why Mary should develop such sympathy for Bates . He may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him , but he still doesn't help himself at all with his actions . ( inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently disused motel ; telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues ; lying about the knives , etc .. ) This , in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept Mary extremely wary of him , but this somehow doesn't happen just so they can play the ' mistaken identity murder game later on . Which in itself is also ridiculous : ' So-and-so is the real killer - plus her as well - also him ! There were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative didn't need extending . It was good to see Perkins reprising his famous role again , but that 's about the only small pleasure to be had . It 's definitely not a patch on Hitchcock , and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you shouldn't be bothering at all .  
  .. for the Lt to have chosen this one . First , the film wasn't horrible , it was just Hollywood . Worst case I need this to happen or we have no movie scenario : if Willis ' mission was to save the doctor , but she was adamant that her " people " make it out of the missionary , he would have put her on that first chopper and marched those refugees to the border without her . He would not have compromised his package for the refugees . That 's not how it works . But , as I pointed out , this is Hollywood , we must have drama . This is why we make movies , because reality isn't quite so complicated . However , I did think that Willis and the good doctor had workable chemistry . That said , there are also some well done battle scenes in the film . It 's not a waste of time , " Tears of the Sun " is worth the dvd rental fee . Check it out on a rainy day and you 'll be satisfied .  
  Ugh ! Another one of those " fooled by the cover " DVDs . I expected some kind of action at least with bears , cats , & such on the cover . I got NOTHING ! Bad movie ! . I forced myself to watch this all the way through thinking that eventually SOMETHING would happen .. no luck . Now the reason I gave this a 2 is because of the scenery ; otherwise it sucked . The kid was terrible , talking to himself ( although I suppose they couldn't just run a movie with dumb music and no dialogue at all ) , doing his lame karate stances to a tree stump , threatening a raccoon , munching on worms , and ( what a dumbass ) kicking a porcupine . And he wouldn't be pulling those quills out that easily either .. they stick like fishhooks . At least he fought the bear ( weakly ) a couple of times . What was up with the flashback thing ? It made a bad movie even worse . I wanted to see a survival movie , not some dramatic bs about a kid suffering thru divorce . What else can I say ? Well , maybe they should have had the bear eat the kid or something . At least that would have been more exciting . People , don't waste your time on this one .  
  This clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking . Jared Rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorly-created character in an ill-fated movie , thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie . The film 's main thrust is how a boy 's temporary excursion into the Canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother 's extramarital affair . Unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random " survival events " ( including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear ) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid isn't just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie ( and what a nightmare it is ! ) . Furthermore , despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film , there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing , including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded . All in all , a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to , much less innocent kids .  
  I wish I could give this movie a zero . Cheesy effects and acting . The only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is . Lets start with the kid who plays Brian . What a geek ! I couldn't believe the mullet ! Then there was the talking to himself . I guess they couldn't just have the movie be silent , but still . Of course they had to have him skinny-dipping too , not something I wanted to see . But Jared gave a great performance , compared to the special effects department . Everything from the bear to the crash was something I could do myself , and better . I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had anything to do with the production , seeing as the movie was not even called Hatchet . Finally , I do not think the writer had ever read the book , seeing as nothing was the same . I think the book was great , but this movie stunk like a smelly goat !  
  After seeing only half of the film in school back in November , today , I saw that it was on Flix channel and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and to write a new review on it . The book that the film is based on , Hatchet , is OK . This is a terrible adaption of it though . Awful ( and I mean awful ) acting , bad dialogue , and average cinematography make up this terrible adaption of Hatchet . The film starts off Brian who is the cliché image of a late 80s teen ( sporting a mullet , banging his head to cheap 80s rock music ) and his mother driving in a car for him to get on a plane to fly up to see his estranged Dad ( his parents are divorced .. now cue the dramatic pause . ) Now Brian has said goodbye to Mom and dog and is flying up to see his father . The pilot is a fat , ugly , rude man ( wasn't like that in the book ) who after 2 minutes in the air , has a heart attack and dies . In the book it goes into more detail with the pilot having more pains and it seemed to be that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack . The plane ( within another two minutes ) has gone empty on fuel ( leaving us , the viewers , to assume that he 's been up there for hours even though the sun hasn't changed position and the scenery looks EXACTLY the same . ) Now 's he 's crashed landed . This is the point in the movie where everything is a lot different then it was in the book . In the book it said his jacket was torn to shreds but in the movie it is perfectly fine with no tears or rips ( looks like he just bought it ) , it never said he climbed a mountain , saw a wolf , and fell asleep up there on the mountain , it never said he was attacked by a bear ( it said a moose but not a bear ) , it never said he eats the several bugs that he does , it never mentions the second tornado or that he learned to get those sparrows , skin them , and eat them or that little fish farm trap that he makes ( that is destroyed by one of the tornadoes ) nor does it mention him hurting his ribs from one of the tornadoes . I don't even think you can call what was depicted in the film a tornado . All it was was just a windstorm that knocked down several of his things . My favorite part of this camp fest was Brian 's lame flashbacks ( that are never mentioned in the book ) especially the cliché scene of Brian waking up , walking over to the window and seeing his Dad ( with all of his things packed that can all perfectly fit into just the back of his truck ) leaving and screams " DAADD ! " ( yet of course his father didn't hear him even though he was just right outside ) and he punches his fist through the window ( wtf ? ) The ending is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book ( I said close . ) In the book I think one of the key things that the rescue pilot said to Brian when he landed was " you 're the kid who they 've been looking for ! They stopped months ago .. " yet they left that line out in the movie . There 's a pathetic epilogue with Brian ( somehow without counseling or therapy ) getting back to normal with his family . I think we were supposed to assume that they were getting together for Thanksgiving ( because they had a turkey on the counter . ) Then it shows his temporary home ( for what , in the movie , seemed like three days , but in the book was for several months ) and his hatchet , still in a tree where he left it ( also didn't happen in the book ) showing where he carved a message , so perfectly done : " HOME " ( where we really supposed to believe that he carved that that perfectly with just that hatchet ? ) No quote can sum this movie up better then when Enid from Ghost World said " this is so bad it 's gone past good and back to bad again . " Perfect description of this movie . I wouldn't recommend it to somebody ( who hasn't read the book ) and are just looking to watch a movie nor would I to somebody who has read the book ( because they 'll be disappointed and bored to death . For those who have read the book , leave what your imagination created as the movie . This is awful and will bring down your thoughts on the book . 1/10  
  this movie has lot of downsides and thats all i could see . it is painfully long and awfully directed . i could see whole audience getting impatient and waiting for it to end . run time is way over 3 hrs which could have been edited to less then 2 hrs . transition between stories is average . most people confessed being on seating expecting something better to come out . its funny only in pockets . ambitious project and a below par execution . govinda does a fair job , anil kapoor disappointed me , rest we as expected . if u r expecting anything close to babel or love actually then its no where close .  
  This is a sad film made for sad people . I was sitting in theaters tearing my hair apart , wanting to break the chairs in front of me as the movie spitted out one cringe-inducing scenes after another . And there were people roaring with laughter behind me , which made me wonder what kind of films these people must be watching to actually enjoy this horse-s * t . Nikkhil Advani has six stories with no plot and no interesting characters . The screenplay is dull , probably he was drunk when he was writing this film . There is no strong hold on any of these stories . Nothing new , nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before . One of the stories is about this couple not being able to have sex because of series of disasters taking place every time they want to do it . I mean seriously is this story really required ? Its not funny , not creative but only proves that Advani has no sense of comedy . Another of the stories ( which was probably the only story I was interested in ) is based on a man 's infidelity and that too ends in a lame age-old sati-savitri pati-parmeshwar crap . I have no idea what the Salmaan-Priyanka plot was all about . There was no issue in the plot for it to be a plot . She can't take Karan Johar 's film because she has to marry Salmaan ? Why can't she marry him and still take the film ? or does Advani and Priyanaka just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors cant be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married ? With six actors in the film obviously Advani cant produce the film all by himself . So he makes full use of sponsors like the Times group , shamelessly promoting their Filmfare magazines . And also some jewelery brand which the women in the film absolutely seem to adore ! I come to IMDb to give it the worst rating and i am shocked to see posts praising the film . It just goes to show the sad state of bollywood and how star struck the fans are . With fans like these , movies like Salaam E Ishq will be continue to be made and worse probably be a hit .  
  i wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry . Porretta was good looking but resembled like a Mexican porn star not an English outlaw . costumes ? what costumes ? a t-shirt with strips of black leather on it . it was Marion 's clothes-or lack of them-that really got me . do the ' fans ' of this stinker really believe women dressed like that in medieval england . the Mongols and vikings were inaccurate and stupid , but the episode with an ALIEN was worst of all . Especially as his make up mainly consisted of oatmeal on his face-an old trick . The hedgehog monster was pretty funny , as was climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of arrows-as if . the US accents grated as did the initial drawling voice over ' RAW-bin Hood and LIDDLE John ' . the second robin and Marion were really quite minging in looks and what was left of the show went totally down the pan ..  
  To confess having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a pretty tough admission for an heterosexual to make . But what can I tell you ? Maybe is that famous extra something that everybody talks about and makes a star a star . It crosses that barrier . It pulls you into unknown sensual and emotional territory . Brando had it in spades , Montgomery Clift , Gary Cooper , James Dean of course and in more recent times , Tom Cruise , Jude Law , Johnny Depp , Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup . Women fell in love with Garbo , Dietrich , Katharine and Audrey Hepburn , Grace Kelly , Marilyn Monroe , Julie Christie , Charlotte Rampling , Meryl Streep , Vanessa Redgrave , Julia Roberts and very very recently Natalie Portman . But Brad Pitt has , singlehandedly , redefined the concept . He is the only reason to go out , get in the car , find parking , buy a ticket , popcorn and get into a theatre to see " Troy " If you liked epics in the " Jupiter 's Darling " style you may enjoy this . But if you don't , go all the same , we want to keep Brad Pitt in business .  
  A craven , cowardly film . Director Boorman shows Cahill burglarizing rich houses , but the male occupant is shown being unfaithful with the nanny , thats all right then . The forensic scientist investigating Cahill is blown up in his car , but he is rat faced sourpuss , and doesn't look like a nice man , so thats all right too . The Beits , owner of Russborrough House , made their money by exploiting ' darkies ' digging up diamonds , so it 's okay to rob priceless art from them and hide it in a bunker in the Wicklow mountains . The Garda kill his ferrets and are implicated in his murder . The moral equivalencing is sickening , Boorman looks for a hit film , but doesn't have the guts to stand against the criminality of the generals gang , who terrorized the neighbourhood , and unleashed another wave of scumbags upon Dublin . He even liaised with the Generals son while making it . Disgusting . Shame on him for his cowardice .  
  Prior to this film , I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi : the trashy zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore ( 1981 ) , famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man-child Peter Bark , and the enjoyably sleazy giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer . Neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema , but both were entertaining in their own special way ( and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didn't hurt ) . Massacre , however , is dull , dull , dull , despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh . The story , about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot , is confusing and oh-so boring : when the blood isn't flowing and the skin isn't on show , the film is a real struggle to sit through ( it took me four attempts to finish ) , with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of note . The only point of interest about the film is that its producer , Lucio Fulci , used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega-gory movie Cat In The Brain ( AKA Nightmare Concert ) . And if you 've already seen that film , then there is very little reason to bother with Massacre .  
  Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi ( Burial Ground ) and produced by legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci . Now with this mix of great talent you would think this movie would have been a true gore fest . This could not be further from that . Massacre falls right on its face as being one of the most boring slasher films I have seen come out of Italian cinema . I was actually struggling to stay awake during the film and I have never had that problem with Italian horror films . Massacre starts out with a hooker being slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax . This scene was used in Fulci 's Nightmare Concert . This isn't a bad scene and it raises your expectations of the movie as being an ax wielding slaughter . Unfortuanitly , the next hour of the movie is SO boring . The movie goes on to a set of a horror film being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly acted your interest starts to leak away . The last 30 minutes of the movie aren't so bad but still could have been much better . The gore in the movie was pathetic and since Fulci used most of the gore scenes in Nightmare Concert there was nothing new here . The end of the movie did leave a nice twist but there was still to much unanswered and the continuity falls right through the floor . This wasn't a very good film but for a true Italian horror freak ( like myself ) this movie is a must have since it is very rare . 4/10 stars  
  As you may have gathered from the title , I wholeheartedly believe this movie to be the worst zombie movie of all time . The acting , camera-work , writing , special effects and anything else remotely related to this movie sucked . People have argued that while this movie is terribly-acted and terribly-produced but it comes through with a witty intelligent script . Wow . The plot has more holes than I or anyone else could possibly count . For starters , why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when it 's not safe ? I know the government 's supposed to be evil but they don't gain anything by killing the entire population of the country . There wouldn't be anyone to govern ! Another thing that I was wondering about , even if the government told everyone to go to work , why would people go if the streets were swarming with zombies ? Were the zombies going to hide in the bushes and ambush the unsuspecting people in order to aid the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet ? And how about the ending ? That stupid Torch guy sacrifices his life in order to get a few close up shots of the zombies . He probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature . And another thing , why does he say Hindenburg before he dies . The Hindenburg was a rare event seen by a very few people . The zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country , possibly the world . He doesn't think anyone else will get a few snapshots ? They also managed to ruin the only semi-interesting scene in the film when the soldier is watching the exotic dancer . Why did the zombie hide behind a curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl ? Especially when the zombie could have come through the DOOR . It 's probably just something an unintelligent zombie movie fan such as myself wouldn't understand . Every day I pray that God with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in Feeding the Masses . Anywho , I think it 's interesting that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to physically hurt the people involved in the production . Hey Trent Haaga , I 'm calling you out !  
  This remake of the 1962 orginal film'o the book has some very good parts to commend it and some fine performances by some fine actors - however Scorsese opts toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch . DeNiro is a superb actor , dedicated to giving his all in the work he does , however he needs direction to focus his talent , and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film . Gregory Peck 's cameo is serviceable but nothing more whilst Robert Michum is always fun to watch , even with as few lines as this . Nick Nolte turns in a better performance than Lorenzo 's Oil but is not on the same form as " Weeds " . Joe Don Baker has some great lines while Juliette Lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes skips a generation . Some good points ? The start credits ( ! ) , the first view of Cody 's back when doing dips in the prison , the scene where Cody is attacked with baseball bats , Sam Bowden 's decent into full-fledged panic , Cody 's outwardly calm but unnerving prescence . The worst ? The " Cleaning woman - BUT NOT REALLY ! " part . Clinging bare-handed to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed . ( Are there no speed bumps in the US ? ) The " He 's dead - BUT NOT REALLY ! " partS and the aforementioned rambling ending . I may watch the original again , but I 've yet to be tempted to watch the remake in four years since seeing it .  
  not to long after Jeff Jarrett left the WWF for good he spoke of that night . Owen Hart and him where good friends and both 2nd generation wrestlers . Jeff first remarks " I was literally pushed thru the curtain as my lifeless friends body was wheeled past me " . Debra McMichael ( Steve Austin 's Ex wife as well as Steve Mondo McMichael Ex wife " . ) As Owen Hart Fell , a video promo the ring was darkened , as a Blue Blazer ( owen Hart Promo was played . The fall and video of owen in the ring was never showed on TV . There are a few news photos that got posted . When they came back from the video promo Jim ross was talking over a all we had was a crowd shot \ . , He stated that Owen Hart as The blue blazer has fallen and doesn't look good . Lawler then came back from the ring his face was ashen he told Jim that the situation was very critical paramedics where working hard to revive him . Rock And HH where going there match in a private room when another Referee came in and told them Owen fell at first , knowing Owen Harts constantly being a prankster they thought it wasn't real . But both later stated that the look of the referee face said it all . In fact as he fell , as mentioned in other post , he yelled for the referee and ring announcer to move . Brother Bret hart was a plane heading to LA to do a angle on the Tonight Show , he couldn't get any of the plane phones to work , One of the captains got a message to call home something had happened . When he landed in La Eric bishoff was there told him what had happened , and put him on a charter flight to Kansas City to the morgue , Bret even later with Owens widow Martha went up to the top of the arena where Owen was standing . Police found no foul play formerly closed as a accident . Most of the Information in Bret Harts book as well as the book by Martha Hart ,  
  This film is awful . The CGI is the very cheap gray blob CGI . The crocodile looks like a large gray smudge . The worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive . It is mostly a photo-shopped CGI that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the CGI smudge across the screen . This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects that I have ever witnessed , and I have seen lots of the very bad Sci-Fi Channel movies . Aside from the terrible lack of special effects , the cast is composed of the typical low-cost actors who probably work as Waiters / Waitresses at local diners while they wait for their Big Breaks . Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault Kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the Villains Headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off Kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building ( and crushing Kate ) the Croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water . No laws of Physics can apply to this movie or the special effects . At least there is honor among crocodiles .  
  This film is really terrible . terrible as in it is a waste of 84 minutes of your life . Special effects are so terrible . The acting wasn't convincing . Its about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about " blood surfing " . Blood surfing is when they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a 31 foot crocodile interrupts there holiday . The sharks don't look real . The crocodile is even worse , and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature , but the crocodile gets stuck and 2 females flash it . The deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in time . A pointless , terrible film thats not worth seeing !  
  Sometimes I rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and / or crocodiles are still getting made these days . They 've been making these lame " Jaws " - copies since the 70s , it 's not like they 're getting any more well-liked . The idea is still exactly the same . So we have an animal that starts murdering people . First it takes down some secondary characters , then it starts attacking the main characters , usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous , who usually plays a specialist . One of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow , usually with an explosion . Then , we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive , or has laid eggs , etc . etc . " Krocodylus " basically uses the same overused ideas , and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation . Unless you count the fact that the " specialist " is a captain in this one variation , in that case your standards are pretty low . It 's funny that he 's played by Duncan Regehr though , he like totally used to be Zorro . Hell I 'll give it a bonus point for that .  
  Wow . Rarely have I felt the need to comment on movies lately , but this one especially is begging for a beatdown . Let 's start at the beginning . First , writer-director Susan Montford puts Kim Basinger in the tired old victim role , complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence . Let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite . Montford 's pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the Christmas tree with no star is laughable . When She Goes Out for some Christmas wrapping paper one dark and ominous night , Della is furious that somebody double-parked their car on the busiest shopping night of the year . She decides to do something about it , so she leaves a nasty note on the car 's windshield . The next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to Della walking around aimlessly in the shopping mall . When she finally gets to her car , the thugs confront her about the note , a cop is killed , and she runs , and they catch up to her , and she gets away , and they chase her some more , and on and on . Everything is completely predictable and uninvolving . The thugs are not scary or menacing at all , and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways . This is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine . Why the bad guys don't just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me . And once , just once , in a film like this , does the leader of the pack have to die last ? What does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept ? Much of the movie simply consists of Lukas Haas running around in the woods screaming " Della ! " And the inclusion of Joy Division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting . The part that really made me run for my computer keypad was when Della , exhausted and hurt , cries out to the heavens , " Where are you , God ? " Where , indeed , was god when this movie was being made ? I give it a 2 only because of competent cinematography and lighting , and it 's not as bad as ' BTK Killer , ' the ultimate marker for judging any terrible film . Cheers !  
  As seems to be the general gist of these comments , the film has some stunning animation ( I watched it on blu-ray ) but it really falls short of any real depth . Firstly the characters are all pretty dull . I got a hint of a kind of Laputa situation between Agito , Toola and the main antagonist Shunack . However maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking ( Laputa being my favourite animé , original Engilsh dub ) . The characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly , leaving poor old Minka jealous and rejected ( she loves Agito , who seems oblivious of this ) . However she promptly seems to forgive Toola at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more " happy " . There is also a serious lack of explanation . Like who are the druids really ? Are they people ? and who are the weird women / girls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest ? There is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans superpowers . The plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the blanks about this . It is almost like a weird version of The Day of the Triffids . And who does call Toola ? why bother with this if it wont be explained ? I really wanted to like this film but I found the plot no where near as deep as a film like Ghost in the Shell or having any real character like those of Miyazaki . I do not resent watching it but I do sort of wish I hadn't bought it . My advice ? Give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare , but borrow it , or buy it cheap ! Perhaps if your new to animé films and don't have much to go by you will enjoy it . It certainly is visually pleasing .  
  One of the those " coming of age " films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids . This movie has neither . It is a poor excuse to let Sylvia Kristel 's body double frolic with a dorky Eric Brown . To make matters worse , the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny , sexy , or dramatic . Laugh awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with burying a dead woman in his front yard . Ponder vigorously on why a woman famous for Emmanuelle needs a body double . As the movie went on and on , I started to imagine a hybrid of Private Lessons and Little Miss Millions that had Sylvia Kristel seduce Jennifer Love Hewitt as Howard Hesseman makes us nostalgic for WKRP . Watch this to laugh at other people 's stupidity , or for Ed Begley Jr . ' s committed performance , or to wonder what Sylvia Kristel would look like with Jennifer Love Hewitt . But I can give you an idea of your lesson , stay away from movies staring Sylvia Kristel that are not Emmanuelle .  
  Horror spoofs are not just a thing of the 21st century . Way before the ' Scary Movie ' series there were a few examples of this genre , mostly in the 80s . But like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss . Some like ' Elvira , Mistress of the Dark ' mostly rise above that , but other like ' Saturday the 14th ' and it 's sequel fail to deliver the laughs . But out of all these types of films there is one particularly big offender and that 's ' Transylvania 6-5000 , ' a major waste of time for many reasons . Pros : A great cast that does it 's best . Some of the dopey humor is amusing . A corny , but catch theme song . Some good Transylvanian locations . Cons : Threadbare plot . Mostly tedious pacing . Most of the humor just doesn't cut it . The monsters are given little to do and little screen time . I thought this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies ? Lame ending that will likely make viewers angry . Final thoughts : This is a comedy ? If it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between ? Comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor , not roll our eyes and yawn , aching for it to be over . I can't believe Anchor Bay released this tired junk . I 'll admit it 's not one of the worst films ever made , but it 's not worth anyone 's time or money even if you 're a fan of any of the actors . See ' Transylvania Twist ' instead . My rating : 2/5  
  This movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s , Jack Pearl ( radio 's " Baron Munchausen " ) as well as Jimmy Durante . However , 7-1/2 decades later , it 's being billed as a Three Stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today . Film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful Edna May Oliver as well as Zazu Pitts . As for the Stooges , this is a film from there very early days-before MGM had any idea what to do with the team . At this point , they were known as " Ted Healy and his Stooges " as Healy was the front man . Fortunately for the Stooges , they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man ( read up on him-you 'll see what I mean ) and the rest is history . Within a year , they were making very successful shorts for Columbia and executives at MGM were soon kicking themselves for losing the team . This sort of thing was a common occurrence at MGM , a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy ( such as the films of Buster Keaton , Laurel and Hardy , Abbott and Costello and others ) . In fact , up until they left for Columbia , MGM put them in a wide variety of odd film roles-including acting with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in DANCING LADY . And , oddly , in this film they didn't act as a team-they just did various supporting roles , such as Larry playing the piano ! This particular film begins with Pearl and Durante lost in the African jungle . When they are rescued and brought home , all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show-punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there . As for Pearl , I could really see why he never made a successful transition to films , as he has the personality of a slug ( but slightly less welcome ) . As for Durante , I never knew what the public saw in him-as least as far as his films are concerned-he was loud and .. loud ! He apparently took time off from helping MGM to ruin Buster Keaton 's career to make this film . Together , Pearl and Durante rely on lots of verbal humor ( ? ) and Vaudeville-style routines that tend to fall rather flat . In this film , the Stooges they didn't yet have the right chemistry . Seeing Healy doing the job that Moe did in their later films is odd . What they did in the film was pretty good , but because all the segments were short , they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines . Stooges fans might be very frustrated at this , though die-hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life-long goal of seeing everything Stooge-even the rotten Joe DeRita and Joe Besser films ( oh , and did they got bad after the deaths of Shemp and Curly ) . Overall , the film is rather dull and disappointing . However , there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess . At about the 13 minute mark , you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing . Look carefully , as this is Walter Brennan in a role you 'd certainly never expect ! Another unusual thing to look for in the film is the " Clean as a Whistle " song starting at about 22 minutes into the film . This song and dance number is clearly an example of a so-called " Pre-Code " scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 ( when the Production Code was strengthened ) . Despite the word " Clean " in the title , it 's a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh-enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything ! It 's quite shocking when seen today , though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s . Finally , at the 63 minute mark , see Jimmy Durante set race relations back a few decades . See the film , you 'll see that I mean !  
  This film 's basic premise is a political cartoon . I suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a " feel-good " film on gender equality . Indeed a recent commentator stated : " it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do . " What claptrap ! No one , man or woman can do anything they want to do , and unfortunately Demi Moore " buffing " up for SEAL Hell Week in the early 27 week BUD / S program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a SEAL is simply not going to make it so . There is approximately an 80 % dropout rate in what is arguably THE roughest military training program - those are the ones who voluntarily drop out , can't compete on a physical level , suffer frequent physical injury during the training or can't handle the psychological harassment . I never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived , purported message of this film . In the real world , Demi wouldn't last the first 24 hours in this harsh and sustained physical training . Wishing alone won't do it . Skip this film as wishful thinking , and better spend your time reading " The Warrior Elite " by Dick Couch ( Crown , New York 2001 ) for the best description as to what really goes on in this training . Ring the bell , Demi !  
  After seeing a heavily censored version of this movie on television years ago , I was curious to see the unedited version . I was surprised that it was more believable and well acted than I remembered , but one thing really stood out . I think other reviewers have mentioned this also , namely , what exactly is the nature and motivation of the Chris Sarandon character ? Has he raped other victims before ? Is he completely psychotic or an " average " sociopath ? How did he expect to get away with his attack on the younger sister ? Is this character at all credible , or is it just a matter of more background being necessary ? He seems almost simultaneously to be an uncomfortably believable character , and too crazy to actually be able to hold on to a teaching job that puts him in contact with young , vulnerable girls . This seems to to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general . It has nothing to do with his performance , which is terrifyingly convincing . The movie occupies an uneasy position between sheer exploitation and a half way serious treatment of the subject , without quite settling into either mode . Not the worst movie ever made , but not all that good , either .  
  ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE ( 1940 ) is the ninth ( 9th ) film of the series and it shows the direction it was inevitably headed into . Characters ANDY HARDY ( Mickey Rooney ) and JUDGE HARDY ( Lewis Stone ) were going to be front and center . The rest of the cast was going too just punch the clock and collect their checks . The series would rise to the occasion again and have its moments but a fatal decline had set in . Lewis Stone throughout the series would continue too portray the character of JUDGE HARDY in a sympathetic manner . The rest of the cast would be professional even though given less and less to do . Mickey Rooney on the other hand would continue his character as if there was no learning curve . ANDYs ' reaction to any situation was in a naive and unbelievable way . Even after he returned as a veteran of World War II service in LOVE LAUGHS AT ANDY HARDY ( 1946 ) his reaction to any ' teapot tempest ' was the same , juvenile . In this film it is clearly illustrated . ANDY gets himself into several unbelievable situations that with a simple explanation would have been resolved . This screen writing device was known as the ' idiot plot ' . A means of stretching a poorly written scenario . Maybe it was less Mickey Rooneys ' fault then the Director and the Writers . Most likely George B . Seitz had directed one too many and a firmer hand was needed too control Rooneys ' excesses . To see our overview of the entire series go to YOU 'RE ONLY YOUNG ONCE ( 1937 ) .  
  I hated this movie . It was absolutely horrible , poor , poor , PITIFUL acting , REAL REAL REAL stupid criminals that weren't even the LEAST BIT funny ( unlike the first 2 home alone movies that were very good ) . all the boobie traps are weak , pathetic excuses for ideas poorly copied of of the first two which just meant that the people writing this movie were just lazy because their paycheck didn't go above 20 bucks a week . This movie is absolutely lousy , it 's not worth even renting . In fact don't even watch it on t . v . ! Go use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two ! I BARELY give this 1 star ( out of 10 ) . Just trust me when I say , if you liked the first two , and you are not a complete stupid person , you will not like this movie , do not watch this movie !  
  Syriana swept the critics upon release and everything seemed to be raving about it . I suppose it 's one of those films that is intensely intelligent .. so intelligent that I think you need to be well versed in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind . I don't consider myself unintelligent , I 've been studying politics since my early teens and I enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless it 's a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message . Syriana tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away . I would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist it 's a 10/10 are lying because they think they look better . This film was the most confusing , senseless , mindless dribble I have seen in awhile .. Especially considering the critical acclaim , the Oscar nods , and the cast . Screenplay writer Stephen Gaghan has disappointed me yet again . His horribly written Havoc preceded this film and I think he 's just trying way too hard . I can't believe he was offered the opportunity to write the Da Vinci Code screenplay . On top of that Gaghan directed the film which made it an absolute mess . I had no idea who anyone was , why things were happening , who was who and what was what . It was a disaster . Because I don't really know who anyone was I can only mention the actors and what I thought of their performances because despite the horrendously complicated script the actors did alright . George Clooney plays C.I.A. field agent and assassin I think ? Bob Barnes . Clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately he 's managed to churn out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part . Barnes was a complex character with a sordid history and if I knew what was going on with him I would have really enjoyed his character . Matt Damon plays Bryan Woodman and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the headlights which I can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it . Amanda Peet plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given . Christopher Plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something . I like Plummer and love seeing him show up even if he doesn't get top billing anymore . The cast is intense if only the story made sense . I 'd like to exact quote the description of plot on IMDb . " A missile disappears in Iran , but the CIA has other problems : the heir to an Emirate gives an oil contract to China , cutting out a US company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and merges with a small firm that has landed a Kazakhstani oil contract . The Department of Justice suspects bribery , and the oil company 's law firm finds a scapegoat . The CIA also needs one when its plot to kill the Emir-apparent fails . Agent Bob Barnes , the fall guy , sorts out the double cross . An American economist parlays the death of his son into a contract to advise the sheik the CIA wants dead . The jobless Pakistanis join a fundamentalist group . All roads start and end in the oil fields . " WHAT ! ? ! ? Say who now ? Syriana might be the thinking man 's movie but it bored me to tears and no matter how hard I tried to stay with it I eventually surrendered and turned it off after an hour and a half and you couldn't have bribed me enough to get me to finish it . I suppose if you want to form an opinion than by all means watch it but I promise you someone looking for entertainment or an enjoyable film will be asleep in the first half hour . 1/10  
  This is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit around drinking beers , eating pizza , and laugh at . Unfortunately for me I found myself watching this one alone . My friends and I rented a big block of movies and never got around to seeing this one . It was due back and I figured that it was a waste not to watch it . So I did , and I was impressed at how absolutely terrible this movie is . Now , I love bad movies quite a bit , and I probably would have liked this one if the " hero " wasn't so utterly loathsome . The entire movie I was hoping that he 'd put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him ! He does very little heroic things in the movie . He 's a beefy , disgusting , stupid thing . He has less redeeming qualities than the villains do . And what was it with all the naked chicks ? I mean , I love naked chicks just as much as the next guy , but this movie went a tad overboard in that department . Well , anyway , if you love bad movies and can stand a disgusting " hero " then I 'm sure you 'll like this schlock of a film .  
  Did anyone else notice whenever they are in the car each time the camera takes a new angle they switch roads . Like in one scene it is a one lane residential with sidewalks , next they are on a multiple lane highway with a divider , next a two lane country road with double yellow lanes . I can understand a low budget but that was just sloppy film work . I also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie . I think that if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy then you may enjoy this movie . If , however , you find his work / not funny then I would recommend staying away from this one .  
  I have to say the first I watched this film was about 6 years ago , and I actually enjoyed it then . I bought the DVD recently , and upon a second viewing I wondered why I liked it . The acting was awful , and as usual we have the stereo-typical clansmen in their fake costumes . The acting was awful at best . Tim Roth did an OK job as did Liam Neeson , but I 've no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking . The plot line was good , but the execution was just poor . I 'm tired of seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the films . Braveheart was even worse though , which is this films only saving grace . But seriously , people didn't speak like that in those days , why do all the actors have to have Glaswegian accents ? Just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes . I notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the Americans , and to be honest I can see why they 'd like it , I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts . However , if you are thinking of buying the DVD , I 'd say spend your money on something else , like a better film .  
  I Am Curious is really two films in one - half of it is the sexual experimental side of Lena and the other half is her curiosity with political / socialism . Whatever the director 's intention , the two don't really mesh together . The director should have just stuck with the romantic side of Lena and made a separate movie for the politics . There is a bizarre mixture of political / war rallies , Dr . King , serious political interviews , flopping breasts , and pubic hair . The film feels more like a fictional documentary than a movie . Other than the interesting sex scenes , you 'll be bored dry watching this film . Unlike many other reviewers , I think the nude / sexual scenes are overdone for what it is . If you want to see real porn , I 'm sure there are better choices . The pervasive nudity is a major distraction from whatever plot there is . I think the cast did a fine job however . They played their parts believably . There is little of the over-the-topness I 'm so used to seeing in the American films during this time .  
  This movie is just like every other dutch movie , so if you enjoy movies such as turks fruit and de kleine blonde dood . then you might be okay with this one ( even though those two have much better stories and actors ) Zomerhitte starts strong enough , but even that one good scene ends up having nothing to do with the storyline . There 's a lot of nudity ( but me and others just could not find that girl attractive ) , the dialog is laughable ( as we did a lot to the annoyance of other movie watchers ) , and some of the scenes are so completely random that this is more of an unintentional comedy than anything else ( like a random scene in which an owl rips somebody 's eye out .. it has nothing to do with anything and is only referenced once later in a sentence saying " did you hear what happened .. I was there " ) . the only reason I gave it a 2 is because some of the places they are at look nice .. that 's it . And the reason I saw it was because we went to the sneak preview ( here in Holland we have a strange system regarding sneak previews , you pay less money then for a regular movie and you don't know what movie it is that you will be watching . All you know is that it 's a new movie that 's not yet in the theaters ) . My advice is to stay far away from this film , if you really want to see a good dutch movie watch temmink or zwartboek .  
  ( aka : DEMONS II ) Made for Italian TV although shot in English and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier DEMONS films . It was supposed to be simply titled , THE OGRE , which is how director Lamberto Bava had released it . An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer . The woman ( Virginia Bryant ) has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine-cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon-like structure hanging down from the ceiling . It glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it . It drips what looks like green paint . Of course the husband doesn't believe any of this . The villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it . But then the OGRE itself appears in what looks like some kind of 16th Centaury costume with what looks like a wolf 's head attached to it and it 's attracted to the scent of orchids . The films isn't really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring . There 's no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool . The OGRE itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family 's Jeep Cherokee . The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was defective , with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film , a flaw I hope Shriek has since corrected . Extras include a short interview with Lamberto Bava where he explains how this wasn't a sequel , etc .. etc .. along with some trailers to other Shriek DVD releases . This is pretty standard stuff . 3 out of 10  
  Oliver Hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see Ollie 's new wife and baby . The problem is , they don't exist-Ollie apparently made them up ! So , it 's up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family . This isn't a particularly unique story idea , as I 've seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot . The best of these was Bobby Vernon 's DON'T KID ME . It is much better than ONE TOO MANY-probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later-when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick . Now I am not against physical comedy , but in some slapstick films , people starting shooting guns wildly , kick and strangle each other , etc . with little provocation . Sadly , at the end of ONE TOO MANY , that 's exactly what they do . None of it makes sense and it was as if they 'd just run out of story ideas . Overall , not exactly a milestone in entertainment . There 's just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan like myself .  
  Someone mentioned editing . This is edited badly and what started out as somewhat intriguing became an incomprehensible mess . For starters , let us know what it is you are trying to do with these experiments . Why are these people the best choices for the type of experimenting they are involved in ? And , what exactly are they testing ? Apparently there is some grand plan that some agency is going to exploit . The acting is pretty bad . Everyone is emoting . Everyone is keeping secrets . They frequently mention that if it weren't for the money , they 'd hang it up . There 's a deranged minister who spouts scripture . On and on . But , again , the biggest hang up is the lack of laying out a playing field for the actors . There are some really cheesy elements . Those little rooms and those chaise lounges . The awful wallpaper ( was it wallpaper ? ) . It was interesting , but didn't seem to go anywhere .  
  I have rarely been subjected to such outright nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure . A horrible joke of a film , I cringed throughout . Terrible , trite , distorted and riddled with outright lies and half truths . The famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw was to originally be a consultant for this film . However , he found the script to be so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused , and also demanded they stop using his name as a source ( it embarrassed him to think people would think he was involved ) . One scene shows Hitler beating his dog . There is not one source for this . Hitler loved animals above people . He brought in the strictest animal welfare laws in Europe , banned vivisection and animal experimentation . He was also a vegetarian . The film turns his gaining of the Iron Cross into a farce , involving bribery . Utter lies . He was awarded it for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time . There are no historical documents showing that Hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece . Not one . Apart from these , Hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this garbage flick . If he was even half as ignorant , demented and thick as he is in this nonsense film as in real life you would not even know he had ever existed . Never mind become the leader of Germany . Honestly , this film was utterly terrible . Go watch Downfall and give this a very wide berth .  
  first this deserves about 5 stars due to acting ( some which would give me a better subjective opinion and NOT an objective one as it should by giving this one , WELL DESERVED , star ) but then i know that those facts are used for the actor ( S ) NAMES to increase the rating of something like this .. i do have a problem with such productions ; yet another attempt ( just like " untraceable " ) of a systematic propagandistic feature promoting government intrusion on your rights ( how interesting that it comes at a moment when IPS providers trying to " preferentiate " = CENSOR information , and the Americans and Canadians are fighting AGAINST that at this very moments ) . this time is not by labeling torrent file transfers as evil ( that one was intended to remind you of such feeling whenever you transfer data on the net ) , but by literally attempting in creating a sexual frustrated population as a whole . SEEMS LIKE FEAR PROMOTION IS HOLLYWOOD 'S NORM THIS DAYS , especially when coming to thrillers which is the most " on demand " motion picture genre for past 2 decades or so = most viewed , best way to try influence the society as a whole . such levels of violence are depicted in this 2 features of morally and " ethical " people , that it gives a new much needed meaning to " anti-heroes " figures . make no mistake , this is NOT " DEXTER " which was meant to be high-quality entertainment . STOP SELLING " FEAR " please , the world would be a better place without it and the dollars made of it . the opening scene and generally the first 10 minutes really give a frightful picture of an Erroll Babbage that is CLEARLLY suffering of sexual frustration . the way he handles the black male is very disturbing if not outright racist ( for sure a " cliche " at least ) ( in real life someone would probably get a beating for it , you will see what i mean ) . the second scene ( with Claire Danes 's character present ) is even more extreme . at that point i realized , in my opinion that Erroll Babbage is a very dangerous individual to people around him . how many people , that have seen or will see this movie , have never been " hold down " ( regarding BOTH sexes ) out of self , COMMON gratification ! ? . typically the movie gives an extreme CRIMINAL case ( that unfortunately did , is and will likely happen again sometime , somewhere ) BUT fingers everyone else indirectly as well as " you could become that " , etc . anyone that is familiar with Sigmund Freud and Jung will know very well that sexuality is not something to be judged let alone " asses " , by such fanatical " hero " here . SAFE sex in its many forms IS healthy and not some evil that apparently Richard Gere character is obsessed with , on his way for some sexual " crusade " . have we not learned anything from the abundant recent scandals involving priests and young boys ! ? or for how long an American teenager can see extreme violence on " pg-13 " but he can not even see a woman breast until " R-18 " ! ? ! ? ( yet the industry targets them with this VERY SAME sexual perversions like " american pie " series for example ) . raise the kids tester-one levels but frustrate them and drive them underground in developing fetishes to UNhealthy EXTREMES ! ? all sexual activities ( upon MUTUAL acceptance ) integrates individuals better then some " rightous " nut-case , THAT blames his misfortunes and shortcomings on " the lives of others " ( a new German movie that would work great in comparing this 2 distinct and world apart features on the very same subject ) . here , like in that movie , you will probably appreciate the actors for well portraying the opposite of what they should have been . i am very disappointed with Richard Gere especially after the recent " hunting party " , a feature where he really shines and about a more realistic " hero " ( after real facts as well ) . but then it just reminds me that all those people are only actors that get paid to play someone 's political and social agenda . " the flock " and " untraceable " 2 heads of the same hidden beast ) ) ) it just reminds you , if know anyone with similar views on the subject as a WHOLE , as Erroll Babbage has those here , to stay clear of them for THEIR own safety . they would kill my family faster then any 0.00001 chances of Paul Jerrod in anyone 's life would .. in the end i recommend this to anyone thinking negative here about MY " assesment " of this particular movie ( and " untraceable " actually ) , so you can likely have similar thoughts as i did . nothing sweeter then a propagandistic movie shooting itself in the " foot " . ) ) ) ) for once i agree with the rating , this is not a feature for teenagers or kids ; simply because at best would confuse them even more then the " common " belief of " money + fame + fashion " and how that relates to sexuality . " scream " series and movies as such AT LEAST have a defined entertainment value ( even if a dumb one in my opinion ) . but this one is just another " trust me i know what is good for you " deeply ( not so well done i might add ) subliminal messages .  
  Cannon pulled off a real visual beauty of a medieval epic that appears fascinating ( except for the dragon prop ) . Now just how did the long-gone studio known for Chuck Norris movies ever come up with a complete lack of knowledge in the first place ? Case in point : the amateurish acting and horrible plot is a sign that reviving the medieval legend is no cure for some lousy execution . They actually went on and made another cheap exploitationer featuring hundreds of lusty bimbos , just to make this look even better . For the two " Barbarian Brothers " , they sure know how to make weird noises than becoming brave warriors so strong and bold enough to save their native land . This is the single greatest waste of potential I 've seen from an " expensive " low-budget movie , and worse enough to let an axe strike through the gorgeous print without mercy . All of this followed an advertising campaign that sold T-shirts based on THE BARBARIANS ! The movie alone makes a great souvenir !  
  This was the worst movie I have ever seen Billy Zane in . I understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new comers , who did pretty good for newbies , but over all , the movie was not believable . With all of the gunfire , you would think the police would have intervened . Even the coin being a bug on Sean was stupid . The way Sean suddenly realizes the coin is the bug , was not realistic . Looks like this movie was slapped together fast . Poor job . Get a better writer . The count down to the end was not in sync with anything . It took longer to fight . And what a coincidence that each time Billy was going to blast Sean , he 'd be out of bullets . Once , I can believe , but not twice . Actually , Billy 's character was goofy . It was so stupid when Sean punches him out at the end . It was like a comedy . Bad ! Bad ! Bad !  
  The second half of Steven Soderbergh 's revolutionary bio on Che Guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to Bolivia . In order to maintain his saintly visage of Che Soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in Cuba and the folly of his Congo adventure ( " This is the history of a failure " he writes in the preface of his Congo Journal ) to concentrate fully on Che 's attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in Bolivia . It would turn out to be a disaster and Guevara 's final act . What plagued the first chapter follows suit here as Soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative Guevara once again being played like James Dean in East of Eden by Bernicio Del Toro . The problem is Guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness Bolivian Jungle . Unlike Werner Herzog in the magnificent , Aguirre , the Wrath of God Soderbergh fails to utilize the jungle 's metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas . He seems more concerned with keeping Che 's nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders . There is one Herzogian moment where Che sits astride an obstinate horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall Soderbergh 's mise en scene remains flat , sloppy and uninteresting . In both of his films Soderbergh shows he is clearly a Che groupie and because of it his focus remains myopic and narrow . He spends too much time building his monument to Che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga , especially Fidel Castro . Making matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire . One would think he was steeped in enough Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that sweeping change is showcased a lot better with sweeping style .  
  First of all , this plot is way overdone - girl wants to make it , everyone loves her , snobby girl intervenes , all looks lost , girl pulls through , everyone loves her again etc . Throw in the fitting in thing , an attractive male crushing on the heroine , plus single-parent troubles and it 's so predictable that you can practically recite along with it . Second of all , I really hate how they keep on dissing classical music . They send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close-minded - in fact , I don't recall the quote exactly , but I remember at one point in the movie , Holly says , " Why do they have to be so uptight .. so classical ? " It 's really insulting how label classical music in this way . Third , I 've went over it dozens of times , but the only reason that I can think of for making this movie is to promote Britney Spears . there just isn't any point at all . And oh yeah , while the actress who portrayed Holly ( I 'm not sure whether that was really her singing or not ) had a reasonably good voice , it wasn't as amazing as they were making it out to be - especially when she was belting . She was oversupporting the whole time . 1/10 stars .  
  can any movie become more naive than this ? you cant believe a piece of this script . and its ssoo predictable that you can tell the plot and the ending from the first 10 minutes . the leading actress seems like she wants to be Barbie ( but she doesn't make it , the doll has MORE acting skills ) . the easiness that the character passes and remains in a a music school makes the phantom of the opera novel seem like a historical biography . i wont even comment on the shallowness of the characters but the ONE good thing of the film is Madsen 's performance which manages to bring life to a melo-like one-dimensional character . The movie is so cheesy that it sticks to your teeth . i can think some 13 year old Britney-obsessed girls shouting " O , do give us a break ! If we want fairy tales there is always the Brothers Grimm book hidden somewhere in the attic " . I gave it 2 instead of one only for Virginia Madsen .  
  Here we are : two travelers from a distant futuristic world arrive on earth .. one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life , another is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the saviour of an entire race . So what could we call this killing machine ? It 's almost like he 's some kind of destroyer , or eradicator .. sort of like an exterminator or something . What 's the word I 'm looking for .. something that terminates things ? Hmm .. Anyway , the protector ( who swiftly doffs the white tunic he stole from Luke Skywalker in favour of local clothing ) finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a future-born hero-to-be . The evil uhh .. " exterminator " kills some rednecks and steals their guns and clothes , then attempts to locate the woman by visiting her workplace and asking around by looking menacingly into people 's eyes and repeating her name threateningly . Then begins a desperate race for survival as the seemingly deathless and unstoppable " exterminator " pursues the couple across the countryside . At some point he may acquire boots and a motorcycle , but I 'm not sure . Perhaps , in an exciting finale , he will attempt to crush them under the wheels of an enormous tanker truck full of .. acid . Then the truck will crash . They will be saved .. but no ! He will then re-emerge , as strong as ever . He will kill the protector and pursue the girl into a meat packing plant , where in a terrifying finish , he is pushed into a large piece of industrial chopping machinery , and destroyed once and for all . But maybe I 'm extrapolating too much .. after all , I did stop watching this movie after Mr . Protector magically impregnates Sean Young by kissing her at a bar , then tells her the child will be born in 3 days . The costumes and effects are great in this movie .. I loved them the first time I saw them on Star Trek : Next Generation too ! Sean Young does another great turn as an unemotive Replicant , and career sweat-hog Stephen Baldwin is also on board as Young 's Fat Cop Boyfriend . Not sure where he fits into the plot though .. maybe he 's an import from a different James Cameron movie ?  
  * spoilers * spoilers * spoilers * spoilers There are bad movies and then there are movies which are so awful that they become affectionately comical in their ineptness . Such is the case with Columbia Pictures ' ' The Grudge . ' This cinematic atrocity began when an otherwise well intentioned American saw a Japanese made for TV film ' Ju-on ' and was inspired to remake the movie in English . This began a virtual tsunami of bad decisions which circumnavigated the globe until it washed ashore in Orlando on October 21 , 2004 . The premise , and I use the word loosely , involves a house in Tokyo haunted by a skinny Momma ghost who looks like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette , along with her ghastly sidekick a chubby , rambunctious but evil second grader . Is there anything scarier than a creepy 8 year old Japanese boy ? Sure there is ! Count Chocula comes to mind . With this whimsical bunch we must add a mysterious black cat who I have affectionately named Chim Chim . ( Remember Speed Racer ? ) As you have already guessed , they were murdered in this domicile of doom and now desire to kill everyone who enters the premises . You see , as explained by a Japanese detective , when someone dies in a rage their ghost seeks revenge on everyone who steps on the property lines as defined by the county commissioner or something like that , I forget . The story begins innocently enough with acclaimed thespian Bill Pullman leaping to his death from a balcony . My guess is Bill Pullman got this job because of his kids begged him for a trip to Tokyo Disneyland . Next we endure the mildly interesting saga of Nurse Yoko , ' oh no don't go in there ' screams the audience , but alas she heeds not the dire warnings and is predictably snuffed out like a magic lantern . About 30 minutes into the movie we finally see its American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen . Sarah Michelle Gellar might be a competent actress but I could not help thinking of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , so much so that it was distracting . It is the equivalent to having Jennifer Anniston star in a movie about the adventures of six friends in New York . Try as you may , you just can't stop thinking about the other project which made her famous . But I digress , Karen , the nurse is hired as a replacement for the original care giver who disappeared at spooks r us . She snoops around , meets the ghosts , coma lady dies , and some other stuff happens . Watching the fair haired vixen searching for clues I half expected her to find the ghost and pull its mask off to reveal it was actually old man Gower who owned the abandoned amusement park ! ' I would 've gotten away with it too if it weren't for you meddling kids and that dog of yours ! ' Director Takashi Shimizu , who is vying to be the Ed Wood of Asia , made two unfortunate decisions involving sound . First , he choose to use a soundtrack only when someone is about to be killed . This is an excellent devise for obliterating any suspense because the audience gets a two minute warning to prepare for another miserably predictable murder . Second , he gave the ghosts a bizarre guttural noise that sounds like a gargling gopher . After the movie , I heard several people exiting the theatre making the sound and laughing . Sarah Michelle Gellar ends up being the sole survivor . And of course we learn that the fire she set to burn down the house was extinguished in time for the obligatory next chapter . However , considering the humorous reactions of the audience , they did not want a sequel but an apology . ' The Grudge ' could be easily re-edited into a comedy , perhaps then it will be appreciated for its camp value . Baring that , this will go down as the greatest cinematic thriller since ' Godzilla vs . Megalon . ' I would suggest waiting until the movie comes to your local discount theatre where it can receive the public ridicule it so richly deserves .  
  Wow , what a total let down ! The fact people think this film is scary is ridiculous . The special effects were a direct rip-off of " The ring . " The story ? Was there one ? Not in my opinion .. Just a bunch of flashy imaging . The entire film was a boring , stupid , mess . I guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns . However , this is the worst horror film I have seen in years . And that Buffy chick ? Well , she 's a bad actress ! As plastic as Barbie and just as talented .. No , wait , that would be an insult to the talents of Barbie ! I suppose many kiddies helped this film at the box office as it was PG-13 , and had it been rated R , it would have bombed IMO ! Stupid movie !  
  I hate to throw out lines like this , but in this case I feel like I have to : the American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst film I have seen in theaters in the last 5 years . There , I said it . And now that I have gotten that out of my system , please let me explain why . " When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage , a curse is born . The curse gathers in that place of death . Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury . " That is the premise of THE GRUDGE and I will admit it sounds intriguing . Unfortunately , the filmmakers take it no further . Those who encounter the " curse " are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get . You want more ? Well too bad . Some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of THE GRUDGE is to scare you . The problem is that when there is no plot to speak of , creepy images and sounds can only go so far . Director Takashi Shimizu , pulling a George Sluizer and remaking his own original film ( s ) , valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour  by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over . It pretty much unfolds like this : - person walks into house - something flashes by the camera and / or a strange sound is heard - person goes to investigate - sound starts to get loud - person sees a ghost - loud scream and / or cat screech - cut to black Before the audience is even given a hint of plot , this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour . The first time was actually somewhat creepy . Each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on . By the time the end of the film rolled around , my friend and I were laughingly wondering if this scene would end " with a loud scream and a cut to black . " We were never proved wrong . The film has no liner storyline , instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled . I have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it is done right . The film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason . I haven't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2 . And this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had . If you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death , how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic ? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone ? Obviously greenlit the second the American version of THE RING made $ 15 million its first weekend , THE GRUDGE is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie . The scariest things about THE GRUDGE are that it made $ 40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the " scariest movie ever made . " I wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see THE GRUDGE ?  
  A Vietnam vet decides to take over a backwater town run amok , and anyone who steps in his path is eliminated ( including women ) . Released to theaters just prior to " A Star Is Born " , which turned his career around , this action-drama mishmash starring Kris Kristofferson is wildly off-kilter , thoughtless and mean-spirited . Filmed in Simi Valley , CA , the results are truly unseemly , with redneck clichés and mindless violence making up most of director George Armitage 's script . Armitage has gathered a most curious ' 70s cast for his film , including Jan-Michael Vincent , Victoria Principal , Bernadette Peters , and , in a bit , Loni Anderson ; however , the center of the whole thing is Kristofferson , who is gruff and rude throughout . It deserves points I suppose for being a completely unsympathetic drive-in thriller , but the bad vibes ( and the ridiculous climax ) coat the whole project like an ugly stain . * 1/2 from *  
  and a 30,000 $ budget and this movie still looks like it was made for 50 $ . You can tell from the first frame to the last that he didn't care one bit about the movies continuity or plot , he was just happy to be making a zombie movie . What the end result shows is a lazy film maker who loves zombie movies . It could have been great if he just had of given a care . The end result is endless zoom ins on poorly done gore , and even more poorly produced metal plays over it . What happens when you combine high hopes , big dreams , a decent budget , hard work , and one idiot behind the camera .  
  Man , what a scam this turned out to be ! Not because it wasn't any good ( as I wasn't really expecting anything from it ) but because I was misled by the DVD sleeve which ignorantly paraded its " stars " as being Stuart Whitman , Stella Stevens and Tony Bill . Sure enough , their names did not appear in the film 's opening credits , much less themselves in the rest of it ! As it turned out , the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure LAS VEGAS LADY ( 1975 )  but what that one has to do with THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER is anybody 's guess Even so , since I paid $ 1.50 for its rental and I was in a monster-movie mood anyhow , I elected to watch the movie regardless and , yup , it stunk ! Apart from the fact that it had a no-name cast and an anonymous crew , an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most I could do with it is laugh at the JAWS-like pretensions and , intentionally so , at the resistible antics of two moronic layabouts-cum-boat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on . The creature itself  a plesiosaur i . e . half-dinosaur / half-fish  is imperfectly realized ( naturally ) but , as had been the case with THE GIANT CLAW ( 1957 ) which I 've also just seen , this didn't seem to bother the film-makers none as they flaunt it as much as they can , especially during the movie 's second half !  
  * Don't read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of " The Crater Lake Monster " to be a total surprise * A claymation plesiosaur rises from the depths of Crater Lake to wreak havoc on a group of local rednecks , not to mention your fast forward button . To call " The Crater Lake Monster " amateurish is to overstate the obvious . If you aren't a fan of low budget drive-in films , you probably wouldn't be looking here in the first place . The problem with the movie is that when there 's no monster action going on , it really sucks and goes nowhere . The script is very Ed Wood-ish , in that it 's utterly contrived in the way it sets up the main action sequences . Nothing is too outlandish for " The Crater Lake Monster " . It explains its dinosaur by having a meteor crash into Crater Lake , ' superheating ' the water to the point where it incubates a dinosaur egg that has apparently been resting at the bottom of the lake for millennia . Even if we could accept that the egg could have been lying there for so long and remained uncovered and viable , wouldn't " superheating " the water to such a high temperature cause most of the lake to evaporate ? Other than some token fog in one or two scenes , we see no evidence of the water being hot , other than a few lines in the script . The script is padded rather obviously in a few sequences , and it will do anything to get the characters near the lake so that they can be menaced by the claymation dino . A couple just passing through experiences car trouble and while their automobile is being serviced , they decide to rent a boat and head out into Crater Lake . Hmm .. do you think these strangers in the story could be there so they would run into our title monstrosity ? In a sequence that 's just plain bizarre , a drunk robs a liquor store and decides to murder the cashier and a bystander instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of booze . A car chase ensues , and wouldn't ya know it .. they end up right by the lake . Snack time for Cratey ! Yeah , it 's not hard to figure out , and you 're so far ahead of the script that you 're irritated when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfold . The shamelessness of it all is endearing , and I really want to like " The Crater Lake Monster " . I just can't do it . There 's not enough here to go on , and this is more of a movie to put on during a party , because you could talk right over it and it wouldn't matter . The film has a slim list of the things going for it , the most important being the dinosaur itself , which appears in three forms : a shadow puppet , a large model head that is dragged woodenly through the water , and a fully realized claymation insert that actually looks pretty good . There are also a pair of lovable hicks in it , and they carry the majority of the intentional humor in the movie . A downbeat ending leaves us mourning the death of both the monster AND one of our beloved hicks , so every good thing about this film is dead by the end of it . Why was I so affected by this conclusion ? Was it the mournful song played over the closing credits ? Or was I just weeping inwardly for the time that I waste watching films like this ?  
  I have nothing against a fast-paced fright-flick , but this Stephen King-derived nonsense is too freshly-scrubbed , too bright and modern . The plot , about a new teenage boy in a small town who is a " Sleepwalker " - sort of a cross between a vampire and a werewolf-and who feeds on the blood of female virgins , begs for a more mysterious , ambiguous treatment . This thriller is given an inappropriately colorful look and feel , with hardly any atmosphere . The kids are predictably pretty and energetic , but the big plus is Alice Kridge as the boy 's mother ; Kridge , from " Ghost Story " , never broke out of the filler-female mold , and it 's a huge loss that she hasn't been used more . Her performance is creepy and intense , and gives hint that " Sleepwalkers " might 've been a much better film with a different focus and tighter direction . It 's too over-the-top and commercially-driven , with an uneven tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama . Stephen King pops up in a cameo , as do real-life directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper . * 1/2 from *  
  There are no spoilers here .. Because there is no plot to spoil . Madchen Amick is living proof a face can make a living acting - no talent required . The only bright spot are a few really good one-liners delivered very nicely by Alice Krige , but then again , she IS Alice Krige . Her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be . She is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot . How they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery . The screenplay writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script . It has major continuity problems , superficial stereotypical characters , horror formula writing , and simply falls short of making any sense what-so-ever . The creatures , while they have neat skills like going " dim " , the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored . Don't waste any time on this one .  
  not your typical vamp story , not bram stoker or anne rice here . a truly original vampyre story . these vampyres are genetic mutants who the sunlight don't bother . they are pure evil to . the film is not perfect . many of the actors are clearly amateurs . the two leads who play van helsing and rally the vampyre chick are pretty good though . the film is intensely violent which may disturb some people . also it is loaded with scientific detail that many will find hard to understand and may get bored with . i was sold on the clever storyline and the couple good performances . no telling how successful this film could be if they had a bigger budget and it got mass distribution  
  I have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further . Nothing about this film worked , absolutely nothing . Delmar our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise ex-jailbird . At the same time her friend Hortense is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her . She also happens to be sleeping with Marlon who is desperately in love with her . Then there 's Delmar 's brother Jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict , Missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father . On the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends , one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film . So far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life , death , grief and love in the first half , the film simply loses direction . If the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed . For instance , why does Delmar think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money , especially when the prospective parents are a creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife ? Why is Hortense so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly doesn't love her ? How is it Missy manages to kick her coke habit overnight ? Is Jethro regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems , or is Missy the exception ? Has Delmar and Jethro 's mother always been on the eccentric side , or is it a more recent development ? Why is Jethro so keen on Cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room ? Why did Moses spend years in prison for stealing a car , a relatively minor crime ? How does Delmar manage to end up giving birth to Moses ' baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex ? These questions are posed in the screenplay but sadly are never answered . I can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script . Big mistake . Losing several subplots especially the Hortense and Marlon story , which adds nothing to the overall film , would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the Delmar , Jethro and Moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else . Add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all , including Jorja Fox who does her best to rise above the material . I 'm not surprised that this appears to have been the director 's last film as this effort shows no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story .  
  This is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies . Once again it doesn't make since . The killer still kills for fun . But this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie . Which means that it is the stupidest movie ever . Don't watch this . If you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it . You 'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it . Because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror , action , and crime . Don't let your children watch this . Teenager , young child or young adult , this movie has that sorta impact upon people .  
  I can't say much about this film . I think it speaks for itself ( as do the current ratings on here ) . I rented this about two years ago and I totally regretted it . I even / tried / to like it by watching it twice , but I just couldn't . I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever , ever again . And I 'm not one to trash a movie , but I truly believe this was awful . It wasn't even funny in the slightest . The only bits I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them . I think this film ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me . All I can think of when I see one of their films now-a-days is this terrible movie , and it reminds me not to waste my money . Amy Poehler is so very annoying , too . Overall , well , I think you get my point . The stars are for Walken , by the way .  
  Personally I think this show looks pretty cheaply made . Some of the actors are terrible . They over do it & seem fake . I can always tell how it 's going to end within the first 10 minutes or less of watching because they make it so transparently clear . It 's not very well written either . I love to watch it to laugh at it . You know the saying " It 's so bad that it 's good ? " Well , that saying applies to this show . I also like to watch just to see if I 'm right when I guess how it 's all going to end . So far I 've been right every time . It 's like a little game that I play . It 's nice when you are bored & you feel like laughing at something .  
  Although there 's Flying Guillotines as part of the title of this movie , it has no connections to the original Flying Guillotines ( 1975 ) and its sequel Flying Guillotines II ( 1978 ) . The two originals are masterpieces of kung-fu movie and still stands out as a classic . This is a much inferior copy of the original , and even as a regular kung-fu movie , it 's below average . First of all , this movie doesn't have much acting . It 's one senseless fight scene after another , and flying guillotine doesn't even play a major part in them . Story is about some Shaolin monks who are tracking down some villains who 've took off with a sacred book , and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot . The same evil prince has plans to lure the monks in and use the flying guillotines on them . There are four movies with Flying Guillotine as part of its title . This in my opinion is of least quality . The design of the flying guillotine in this movie is different from the other three indicating that this movie was produced by a different entity from the other three . The movie has no chemistry asides from being unintentionally funny due to poor production . Best skip this and watch the two originals .  
  This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 ( the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972 ) . Regardless of the exact date , the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period-with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s . The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks . These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort . This was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art , and like most performance art , it 's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome . The film , to put it even more bluntly , is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film , their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and " with it " to be understood by us mortals .  
  Some have praised _ Atlantis : _ The_Lost_Empire _ as a Disney adventure for adults . I don't think so-at least not for thinking adults . This script suggests a beginning as a live-action movie , that struck someone as the type of crap you cannot sell to adults anymore . The " crack staff " of many older adventure movies has been done well before , ( think _ The Dirty Dozen _ ) but _ Atlantis _ represents one of the worse films in that motif . The characters are weak . Even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best . An MD / Medicine Man , a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons , if we have not at least seen these before , we have seen mix-and-match quirks before . The story about how one companion , Vinny played by Don Novello ( Fr . Guido Sarducci ) , went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing . Only the main character , Milo Thatch , a young Atlantis-obsessed academic voiced by Michael J . Fox , has any depth to him . Milo 's search for Atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him . The opening scene shows a much younger Milo giddily perched on a knee , as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head . And while the characters were thin at best , the best part about _ Atlantis _ was the voice talent . Perhaps Milo 's depth is no thicker than Fox 's charm . Commander Rourke loses nothing being voiced by James Garner . Although Rourke is a pretty stock military type , Garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery . Garner 's vocal performance is the high point . I 'm sorry to say Leonard Nimoy 's Dying King is nothing more than obligatory . Additionally , Don Novello as the demolition expert , Vinny Santorini , was also notable for one or two well-done , funny lines-but I 've always liked Father Guido Sarducci , anyway . Also well done was the Computer Animation . The BACKGROUND animation , that is . The character animation has not been this bad for Disney since the minimalism that drove Don Bluth out the door . The character animation does nothing if not make already flat characters appear even flatter . Aside from landscapes , buildings and vehicles there isn't much to impress . The plot was the worst . Some say hackneyed or trite . I 'm not so sure about that . Any serviceable plot can be made into something new with the proper treatment . Shakespeare often started from a known story and plot and was famous only for putting on a new coat of paint . So the treatment is the thing . And _ Atlantis _ obviously lacks that . I cannot begin to go into all the logic gaps without a spoiler section . The plot was bad . The plot 's bridges snap like twine and the ending does not make sense . To add to that , the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness . * SPOILERS * 1 . Right at the beginning when Milo reveals that runic or Celtic symbols have been wrongly transliterated and the " Coast of Ireland " should read the " Coast of Iceland " , we begin to have problems . The writers of the script would need to know the British take for Eire or Eireann as " Ireland " , and completely ignore the older , Latin term Hibernia . But more than this , they need to know of the Vikings conspiracy to call the greener island Iceland and the icier island Greenland . By making it the matter of a mis-tranliterated " letter " , the writers have doomed themselves to requiring a runic version of English and a post-Roman date on the script . Since this is long after Atlantis was supposed to have sunk into its undersea cave . And without visible clues and less technology than Milo had , made the inscription far less trustworthy . 2 . The Shepard 's Journal could not be written before the sinking of Atlantis , or it would know nothing about the cave or the crystal lying " in the King 's eye " . It must have been written after the sinking , but without even the technology that Milo 's expedition had , how the heck did anybody get by the Leviathan . So how could it know more about anything after that ? And why would it be written in Atlantian ? Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things . However clairvoyance and astral travel do not require the shepard to write in Atlantian . So it 's got to be some sort automatic writing . Since noone left in Atlantis can read , it must be the spirits of the crystal beaming messages to the surface . This would have made more sense . But could also have been explained within the movie : Milo could have discovered that this power had been calling him all his life-appeared in dreams , etc . This needed to be explored in the movie . 3 . The Atlantians should simply not be able to comprehend modern languages . No-one expects that the original Indo-Europeans would be able to converse in Europe , anymore than Romans would understand that hard " c " s or their day became French " ch " s ( pronounced like " sh " s , no less ! ) 4 . Current Atlantians were alive before the cataclysm-when apparently they * could * read , yet now are unable to read what they used to , or operate similar machinery . 5 . The Mass Illiteracy points out a crucial flaw in the movie . NOTHING seems to have happened to this culture . It seems suspended in air until Milo can rescue it . Even though it appears that life is not a constant struggle for survival , no-one wants to compose poetry or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of Atlantian school systems going downhill toward the end and lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall into illiteracy . 5 . Kida can be excused for not knowing how to read or operate the machinery if she was so young when the Cataclysm of Stupidity set in-But ANY OF IT * HARDLY * qualifies her father for Deification ! Kashakim 's foolishness almost single-handedly wiped his people from existence . Killed a bunch in the cataclysm , stalled progress ( not a lot killed here , but he oversaw a massive slide in culture and progress ) until someone could take the crystal to kill everybody , if they weren't boiled in lava first because the Giant Robots weren't there to protect them . A bolt of blue electricity should have shattered Kashakim 's likeness , when Kida tried joining her father 's image to the circle of GREAT Kings of Atlantis ! 6 . Even though Milo was the only one who could read Atlantian , Rourke and others knew enough to look through a book of gibberish and find a page on a crystal-which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or " phases of the sun " diagram . 7 . If Milo 's grandfather had told Rourke about it , it still does not explain what how Rourke would have suffered from Milo 's reading it as part of the book . Ripping out the page-which was dog-eared in Rourke 's hand , even though Milo found NO sign of a torn page in the book apparently-only was there to tip off the viewer that " something was not quite right " . Unless the word " crystal " would have set alarms off in Milo 's head that somebody would try to steal it , Milo would have suspected nothing . It 's just thick-headed foreshadowing . 8 . The crew 's " double-cross " was not a character change . We learned that Vinny , Sweet , Audrey and Cookie had been going along with Rourke from the beginning . However , the " change of heart " falls flat . It was a change , and needed to be better motivated . Hard to do with characters who weren't given anything to begin with . 9 . Niggling little bit that the lava flows up over the dome , instead of filling in the rest of the area that we view the sequence from . It 's liquid ; it will not flow over the protective dome until it fills up all lower areas . 10 . The ending STINKS ! - and makes no sense other than to appease political correctness . With it 's powersource restored , Atlantis is no longer a weak power , needing coddling . The giant robot guardians and the sky-cycles shooting blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear from us than they might . The technology is superior to ours , and definitely to early 20th-century . In the end Milo needs to teach the Atlantians to read , for what ? The whole idea is to leave their little quiet , chastened culture alone , not to send it into hyperdrive . * END SPOILERS * Perhaps , the Lost World plot and the turn of the century setting should give me a hint that this is more an homage to pulps . The failures I find with the film agree with this idea . But I am at a loss why I should pay to see thin characters and plot holes simply because many dime novels had them as well . And pulp stories is part of the " crap they can't sell adults anymore " , anyway . We have become a bit more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow up as well . Raiders of the Lost Ark lost none of its pulp feel and avoided so much badness . 4 out of 10-the movie is enjoyable but as I think about the plot , it seeps ever lower .  
  Where to begin ? # 1 Amitabh 's son , played by Akshaye Khanna , is 30 . Amitabh 's been in prison for 33 + years .. he A ) Telepathically transmitted the sperm home ? B ) Asked a nice Pakistani guard to mail it for him ? C ) They allow conjugal visits in secret Pakistani Jails D ) All of the above E ) The producers were having a little too much bhang at the time they approved the script ? # 2 ) Amrita Rao ( Yumm ! ) wants Khanna - he 's yum , yum , yummy .. and apparently he wants her - who wouldn't , right ? ! .. But , when her dad gets ratted out , and then killed ( I hardly think this is a ' spoiler ' as you 'd have to be brain-dead and blind not to see this coming in the film ) he 's pretty emotionless towards this catastrophe and with the tip ( metaphorically ) of his hat , leaves her behind to save his dad , never mind her loss , and says ( paraphrasing ) " If god wills it , we 'll meet again " .. Basically meaning , " I 'm gonna get my dad and MY job done , sorry for your loss - CYA ! Buh Bye ! " - callus beyond even low-life Hollywood standards .. # 3 ) There are so many holes in this horrible waste of time called a movie , that you can drive all the jeeps , trucks camels and any extra stuff through it . Pass - really , complete and total waste of time - Oh ! There is a great dance sequence ( yes , only one - as in dance sequence - regardless of quality ) great belly dancing - but NOT worth watching just for this . Rent Veer-Zaara or Lakshya ( will Hrithik Roshan ever take acting lessons ? ) for better Indo-Pak conflict movies .. In fact , Veer-Zaara is pretty damned good - 7.5/8 I 'd say !  
  Not that I was really surprised .. movies are never as good as the books that they originated from . I was looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my favorite books , even though I knew it would probably suck . I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised . However , they strayed from the book 's storyline too much , and the movie version did not convey how horrible this house really was . Ending was different too . Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible due to some really bad cosmetic surgery . The acting was unremarkable at best . Perhaps if a theatrical version was made so that they wouldn't have to stay so much in Lifetime 's " made for TV movie " box , it would be a better flick . If you saw this movie I highly encourage you to track down the book and read it . I doubt you 'll be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as I do every time I read it .  
  This is not an entirely bad movie . The plot ( new house built next door seems to be haunted ) is not bad , the mood is creepy enough , and the acting is okay . The big problem I had is that , being familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle ( from Twin Peaks and other shows ) , I couldn't get over how different she looks with her apparently new , big lips . I kept staring at them . They look so out of place on her face ! They make her look completely different ( and not better ) . Mark-Paul Gosselaar , the actor who plays Kim the architect who designs and pours his heart and soul into the house , does a fine job . And Lara ( as Col ) is also quite good ( but those lips ! ) as the owner of the house next door . Her husband , Walker ( Colin Ferguson ) is appropriately wooden . The various characters who live in the house were also fine . I particularly liked Pie ( Charlotte Sullivan ) and her husband , Buddy ( Stephen Amell ) , the first people to move into the house . The attempt to involve us in the overall neighborhood vibe fails , unfortunately , as the other neighbors are not particularly likable . For some reason the director was unable to make the " haunted " house particularly ominous . Other movies ( such as Amityville Horror , The Legend of Hell House ) manage to achieve that spooky feel , but it just doesn't happen here . The closest is when Col paints a depiction of the house . Another thing that didn't work for me is the plot twist that occurs with Kim , the architect . Initially , he appears to be a victim of the house like the others ( it has sucked him dry of inspiration ) , but later he seems to have joined forces with it in evil . Overall , not a bad movie for horror fans if you can take your eyes off those big lips !  
  This movie is pure guano . Mom always said if you can't say anything nice .. but even Mom would say I had to do my part to warn others of this movie . I can guarantee this is the film that Geoffrey Rush wishes would just go away . I would hope that Greg Kinnear fired his agent .. from a cannon for giving him the script . After this Ben Stiller is probably praying for someone to pitch " There 's Still Something About Mary . " I have always been a fan of Wes Studi 's , thank whatever you hold holy that he wore a mask through the film so maybe people won't identify the film with him . It starts of promisingly with a stylistic spoof of the cinematography of the Batman films and then just loses something .. like a coherent plot and half decent effects . The jokes are telegraphed an hour before the punchline comes , and even then they fall flat . If you want to see an effective spoof of the comic book world see " Chasing Amy " . RUN ! DON'T WALK AWAY FROM " MYSTERY MEN " !  
  Well I 'll start with the good points . The movie was only 86 minutes long , and some of it was so bad it was funny . Now for the low points . My first warning sign came with an actual " warning " on the film . When it started the following " warning " was displayed : " The film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images . Because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun , pretty or romantic . " I should have saved myself the 86 minutes and turned it off then . The first words of the film were : " I 'm at the glue factory . " It was some guy talking on his phone , and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory . I don't know why . So the basis of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the Zodiac Killer and starts imitating him . The budget for this film was at least 50 bucks and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find . The acting was worse than me reading straight from a script . That 's what is looked like they were doing . The script was horrible , and the big " twist " was that this guy who wrote a biography on the Zodiac Killer was actually the Zodiac Killer . Of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious within the first 10 minutes . Without any more painful details of the plot , here were some horrible highlights of the movie . They try to make the Zodiac Killer compare himself to an " army of one " because soldiers are really just murderers . Then they tried to make an attempt at " Satanic Worship " by showing some guys in black hoods in a meeting . The great " computer hacker " was able to get this kid 's address when someone gave him the kid 's name and phone number . For some reason he had to hack into the FBI to get someone address . I 'm not sure why he didn't just look it up in the phone book or use whitepages . com . There was also a random allusion to 9/11 for no reason . I also learned that no matter where you get shot , blood will come out of your mouth within seconds . So if you like really bad acting , sub-par scripts , bad camera work and an obvious plot , you 'll love Zodiac Killer !  
  Why ? Because for one reason , there has never been a more adorable scene in any film than Ann Margret singing " Bye Bye Birdie " at the opening . She reprises it again at the ending , too ( in a different mood ! ) . Both wonderful . Rent it and see . Even if that 's all of it that you watch . You 'll agree , I 'm sure . Everything about the original was so excellent it just didn't need a remake , sorry ! Jason and Vanessa gave commendable performances , as well as Tyne and Chynna . In fact , all the actors and singers in this new version were giving their ' all , ' but it 's like trying to improve on " Casablanca " - it just can't be done ! It 's even annoying finding yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to appreciate the remake , and it just falls short , through no fault of the actors .  
  Following a car accident , a mad scientist ( Jason Evers ) keeps the head of his fiancee ( Virgina Leith ) alive . He then goes on the prowl looking for the perfect body to make her whole again . Pretty lame all the way around , nothing redeeming here . Also in the cast are : Leslie Daniels , Bonnie Sharie and Bruce Brighton . Someone should have helped put this one out of its misery . Let it die .  
  Perhaps one of the most overrated so-called horror classics ever made , Halloween does feature the memorable Michael Myers and some great acting by Jamie Lee Curtis . However , its rewatchability factor is very close to zero , as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on dullness / culmination to the actual events . This is the sort of movie you can walk away from to microwave popcorn and not miss anything at all . How it spawned so many sequels , I will never comprehend . Thank God Rob Zombie is remaking this . And generally , I hate remakes . Surely he will more than compensate for all the random time-filling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely lacks . This is a movie we feel we have to like , much like the way we 're taught that we SHOULD enjoy Dickens . Don't assume this is a classic .  
  I caught this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival . I hadn't heard much about it ; only that it was a tightly-paced thriller , shot digitally on a very low budget . I was hoping to catch the next big Brit-Flick . But I have to say , I was severely disappointed . " This Is Not A Love Song " follows two criminals , who , after accidentally shooting and killing a farmer 's young daughter , become embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them down . The real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a British film . The camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story , as are the over the top performances , and the appalling use of slow motion , which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video . There are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty , which instead come over as hilarious and over the top ( Cue a pathetic , obligatory drug scene , and countless , pointless camera zooms ) . No amount of cliche 's such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad story . We 've seen this kind of thing many times before , and made a hundred times better , particularly in John Boorman 's masterful " Deliverance . " But while in the latter film , we actually cared about the characters , in this film , I found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible . Even this wouldn't have been so bad if their adversaries had been frightening or worthwhile , but instead , are merely a collection of stereotypical , inbred-looking countryfolk . Again , another offensive , overused cliche ' coming to the fore . Surely there are some nice people in the country , filmmakers ? In its defense , " This Is Not A Love Song " does contain a couple of good , suspenseful moments , but it 's hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video , or , at a push , getting a very limited cinema release . It 's not a patch on last year 's Low-Budget hunted in the hills movie , " Dog soldiers " . Maybe British Cinema could actually get kick-started again if the right money stopped going to the wrong people .  
  Now , I won't deny that when I purchased this off eBay , I had high expectations . This was an incredible out-of-print work from the master of comedy that I so enjoy . However , I was soon to be disappointed . Apologies to those who enjoyed it , but I just found the Compleat Al to be very difficult to watch . I got a few smiles , sure , but the majority of the funny came from the music videos ( which I 've got on DVD ) and the rest was basically filler . You could tell that this was not Al 's greatest video achievement ( that honor goes to UHF ) . Honestly , I doubt if this will ever make the jump to DVD , so if you 're an ultra-hardcore Al fan and just HAVE to own everything , buy the tape off eBay . Just don't pay too much for it .  
  This motion picture comes straight out of the dark dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment . This production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 90 's by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies . The most famous disasters in their ouvre are " Subspecies " , " Seedpeople " and " Trancers " . None of these are recommended and neither is Doctor Mordrid , actually . Hyperactive director Charles Band did come to the right company for his film . Doctor Mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely humourless . I only saw it because it stars Jeffrey Combs . I learned that it can have several disadvantages if you 're a fan of him . For every good movie , it seems like he has made 5 inferior ones . Anyways , the story is about the battle between 2 ancient sorcerers . One good one who 's here since 150 years to protect the humans ( Jeffrey as Dr . Mordrid ) and one wicked one called Kabal . He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason I already forgot . Combs gets his instructions from mentor . That " guy " only exists of a pair of eyes in space . Very very cheesy , that is ! Every once and a while a blinding lightflash is shown on the screen but that 's about the only form of Special effects this movie has got . The whole thing is just a piece of whining and nagging and when the two wizards finally face each other , it 's over before you know it .. I would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little , but noo .. In some scenes , you really can detect some originality and creativity ( like for example Jeffrey 's lecture about the influence of the moon on criminals ) and if you really pay attention , you might even find some very small but nice aspects ( like the raven which is called Edgar Allen ) but overall , it 's a terrible waste of time and energy . I 'm a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe he is a superhero in my eyes .. but he sure doesn't have to put on a stupid maillot for that .  
  Okay .. it seems like so far , only the Barman fans have commented on this film - time for a counterpoint . Beware , this writeup is * LONG * . For those not in the knowing ( mostly the non-Belgians ) : Tom Barman , director of this film , is the frontman of dEUS , one of the better known rock bands of the late 90 's here in Belgium . Basically , they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale . Then , egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart , with Barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the dEUS-monicker . The way it always happens in such cases , the post-breakdown dEUS was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original . They tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album " The Ideal Crash " in 1999 , presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting . They didn't quite make it . However , egos were still pretty big it seems : big enough for Barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies . More often than not this sort of thing is a VERY big mistake , and this film does not make the exception . And Barman clearly went for * art * on this one , another very big mistake . For one thing , he 's a musician , not a movie director . For another , dEUS at it 's best made fun and provoking music , but never anything close to what I would consider * art * . It shows . So , what 's this movie about ? Basically , it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people , doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in Antwerp , as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting . The characters are shallow , the plot totally pointless and the film just doesn't have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings . Humor ? The whole film made me smile ( slightly ) about 3 times , and actually managed to provoke a single 5-second laugh ( not quite loud ) . Mood ? The film just doesn't seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all . Mystery ? Well , ( * MINOR SPOILER * ) the idea of the " wind-man " , inspiring the name of the film , is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza - not very , and has been done a thousand times before ( anyone remember Johny Destiny - one of Tarantino 's worst appearances on film to date ) ( * END MINOR SPOILER * ) . And well , its * artistic * , so don't expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous . In other words , except for the few smiles , it bored me out of my shorts . So what remains ? Well , the soundtrack is pretty good , though it suffers from some of the same problems that other OST 's have shown lately : first , it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the CD . Second , it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs , which simply doesn't work . In the end , it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs . And sadly , it 's Barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention , though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as I 'm concerned . All in all , it just stands to show that Barman knows more about music than movies . Camera work is okay as well , though not anything that would make you scream out with joy . The only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sight-seeing factor . Since I originate from Antwerp , it was fun to play a kind of " guess-the-location " game . I would hardly consider this as a quality though . All in all , another chance lost for Flemmish film . I keep on noticing that lately , the best Belgian movies have been coming from the French part of the country . This is mostly because at least , they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional ( the brothers Daerden come to mind ) . Maybe the Flemmish art-house filmmakers should try that too .  
  Actually , they don't , but they certainly did when trying to think of a singular line that adequately summarises how terrible this entry in the series really is . There were some moments that could have been good , but they are mostly outweighed by their own conversion into missed opportunities , and don't get me started on the bad . The wasted opportunities are pretty obvious , but I will recap them here in case anyone cares . Anyone who hasn't seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point . The first , and potentially the biggest , wasted opportunity , was the plot with Freddy 's long-lost child . Now , the extreme mental illness that Freddy appears to suffer ( and I might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people , leave alone to this extent ) is HEREDITARY , so why not a mystery-type slasher in which Lisa Zane 's character dreams of Freddy murdering the teens , only we later discover it 's actually her doing all the killing ? Sound like a good plot idea to you ? Obviously it was above the heads of Talalay and De Luca . Then there 's the trip to Springfield , where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out , and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis . Funnily enough , said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner , although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much . We are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond one 's comprehension and control . The essential problem with this plot element , however , is that the town is abandoned too quickly , and with no real answers . This collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say .. one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the Springfield fair looks like a horror show . Of course , horror films are never noted for their character development , unless they 're the kind of horror films John Carpenter used to direct , but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die ? At least Wes Craven took the time to set up his characters in the original , and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in . That , in a nutshell , is probably the biggest problem with Freddy 's Dead : it just doesn't try at all , leave alone hard enough . On a related note , I feel kind of sorry for Robert Englund , now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the Freddy character . He has played far better characters in far better productions ( the science-fiction miniseries " V " , for example ) , and to be forever remembered as " the man who played Freddy " is selling him rather short . It seems he will never break the mold of horror films now . As for the rest of the cast , well , I think their performances here speak for themselves . They deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than B-grade horror props . Even Yaphet Kotto doesn't escape this one unscathed , as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of B-films . All in all , Freddy 's Dead gets a 1 out of me . I 'd vote lower , but the IMDb doesn't allow for that . FD is really a testament to how a writer 's inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film , but an entire franchise .  
  I absolutely love all of Tom Robbins books , so I was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of his books . I knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of Robbins ' magic , but after seeing the movie , it made me never want to read the book again . The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues doesn't include an eighth of the content in the book , and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else . Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie , I think that better actors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters . The only actors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins ' descriptions in the book were Julian 's friends , in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie . Those who haven't read the book might enjoy the movie , but as a huge Tom Robbins fan , this movie was nothing but a disappointment .  
  After watching KHAKEE i felt i 'll get to watch another good film but sadly The film is a joke and actually trying hard to introduce Aryeman Afterall his father Keshu is the producer RKS spoke so highly about the film during promotions , saying the film has meat unlike films released that time , I wonder which films was he talking about The film is actually a typical Masala film with loads of comedy , romance , action everything jumbled The ease at which the kids kidnap the family , is one of the funniest parts ever , Imagine kids kidnapping Dawood 's family The end is a complete jumble mumble with sudden change of characterization RKS gives his weakest film till date , except some Bachchan scenes the film is a bore Music is boring Amitabh tries to give the role his all , he does his part well , though not his best though he contorts his face too much when pulling a trigger and does a weird look while smoking the cigar His dubbing too isn't matched properly at times Akshay is there for some minutes and just repeats his act and hams Aryeman seems expressionless , tries too hard but overdoes it in some scenes Bhumika emerges the best of the lot The rest are okay  
  I cant describe how terrible this movie is . Am i the only one here who finds the way its animated totaly disgusting ? The Men of Rohan look 100 % fake with their poorly colored hair , that doesnt even come close to matching what the actors look like . The orcs looked terrible . Why does gandalf walk with a bad limp ? Why cant they pronounce things correctly ? Saruman isnt Aruman . There were other what sounded like terrible pronounciation * sp * of Tolkiens characters . All and all im glad the studio who made this pulled the plug out from the sequal , it was just a terrible terrible adaptaion . Go watch the hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon of Tolkiens work . Hell , even the cartoon version of ROTK is better then this dribble . 2/10  
  A truly dreadful film . I did not know initially that this was a Kiwi effort - but very soon I started to realize that all the characters were speaking with hardly disguised kiwi accents under the fake American ones . Why did it need to be set n America anyway ? - it could have been set in NZ and then the actors could have used their normal voices . Surely someone in the production team could hear the dreadful attempts at speaking with American accents ? A bad bad film . I am surprised it has lasted this long - how did it make it out of the can ? It just seemed like a very poor attempt at a Segal / Willis type action man flick . A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY ! If there was any TAXPAYER money in this piece of trash , I would be leading a revolution to have all the money put back into the Treasury . I am still reeling ( get it ? pun , reeling ! ) at the absolute garbage I have just seen . Why did I continue to watch ? Well , I am a movie fanatic and cant help , myself !  
  The cult of personality has elevated the status of Roger Corman , Sam Arkoff , Lloyd Kaufman etc . as kings of the B 's . Because the folks at Crown International were so key , they haven't been elevated to the status they richly deserve . A film like THE VAN may now seem like a disposable piece of Drive-in esoteria , but it was a sizable hit when it was released ( not to mention subsequent re-releases as a double feature with other Crown hits ) . THE VAN was a perfect example of Crown 's hit strategy of seizing upon the mood of movie-goers at the time of a film 's release . Here , it was sex , drugs , rock ' n roll and the brief " Custom Van " fad . As others have noted , it is ironic that the " hit " song in the film refers to a Chevy when the title vehicle is a Dodge in the film itself . I had a town Selectman where I was at the time even declare these vans to be " dens of sin on wheels ! " A perfect ad line for the film ! There are the usual assortment of " good " and " bad " girls , muscle-heads and low-brow hijinks ( including a supporting bit by Danny DeVito ) . In many ways this isn't much different from the old Beach Party movies of the 60 's , but now spiced up with Nudity and Drug use . Obviously done on a limited budget and a limited schedule , the film coasts along pleasantly enough with a breezy charm that compensates for some , by today 's standards certainly , un-PC views of women . The classic touch is a Toaster for Bobby 's den of sin on wheels . Yes , a Toaster ! Hey , you gotta have something hot for those munchies ! Grindhouse Fest .  
  I agree with most if not all of the previous commenter 's Tom ( bighouseaz @ yahoo . com ) . The Zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement . I have seen Zatoichi 1-13,15,16 ; I believe 14 has not been released on Zone 1 ( usa ) . Zatoichi the Outlaw was disappointing . The story line was complicated , and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous Zatoichi story lines . At one point , I was wondering if I was not seeing a remake of a previous Zatoichi film . This film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects ( a head rolling , limbs severed , blood ) and less on the nobility of the Zatoichi character . All the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action , and won a great following without having to resort to effects . I am just hoping that the remaining Zatoichi films do NOT follow the same trend . This is the first Zatoichi film from his studio . I highly recommend all the previous Zatoichi films - and recommend them .  
  Between 1937 and 1939 , Twentieth Century-Fox made a ton of Mr . Moto films . However , towards the end of the series , it was obvious that the studio had " jumped the shark " , so to speak . This phrase indicates that a TV show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to invigorate the show by fundamentally changing the formula . For example , with " The Brady Bunch " they introduced the annoying ' Cousin Oliver ' and with " Family Ties " they introduced a freak baby who grew up six years in only one season ! With the Moto films , they 'd jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be re-tooled . In the previous film , Warren Hymer played an annoying wrestler . And , in this film the character Archibald Featherstone appears . Featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever , as you kept hoping someone ( preferably Moto ) would kill him just to shut him up ! Although he 's supposed to work for the famed Scotland Yard , he shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip . Again and again , his scenes were boorish and unnecessary and Peter Lorre just looks pained as he stands there and watches this buffoon " act " . It 's so bad that it truly destroys what COULD have been one of the better Moto films due to its clever plot . As for the plot , the crown of the Queen of Sheba is discovered in the opening scene . Moto , now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he originally was , is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen . In a great twist , several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each other . Overall , the film is watchable but is also ample evidence that the Moto series should have ended here . With WWII approaching , the films couldn't have survived much longer anyway , as having a sympathetic Japanese leading character simply wouldn't have been accepted in the US or in allied countries .  
  Caught part of GEORGE 2 on TV recently , but couldn't get myself to watch it through to the end . Just awful ! I can't even remember the plot . All I know is that George and Ursula were not the George and Ursula of the first movie , which was bad enough . There 's a lot of scrambling around , but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy , it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes . Having the original voice of Ape the Ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this . GEORGE 2 is probably the single worst sequel I have ever seen , and that is saying something . Jeez , because of IMDb 's 10 lines rule , I have to keep typing when I have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made-for-TV sequel . Disney , hang your head in shame .  
  As I sat subjected to this televised mediocrity , I wondered why ? Why did Dianne Keaton agree to this trash ? The movie uses meaningless , contrived plot lines to deliver trash to homes of thousands . The movie takes a political agenda to a new level . The movie was meaningless , and all creditability was lost to the excessive use of stereotype . It was obvious that Keaton tried to make this movie worthwhile , but in the end she needs to remember the age old adage that you cannot polish a turd . I hope that you did not waste your New Year 's Day watching another mindless made for TV movie . I now know why the networks started airing series on Sunday night , to rid us of trash !  
  Not long enough to be feature length and not abrupt enough to a short , this thing exists for one reason , to have a lesbian three-way . There are worse reasons to exist . One sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature length movie . Misty fits snuggly into her outfit and is a very cocky girl and when people are so infatuated with a game character , like Lara Croft , that they make nude calenders of her , you know that a soft-core flick is set to explode . Unfortunately , this is pretty pathetic . Especially the painfully fake sex scene between Darian and Misty , where you can see her hand is fingering air . Watch this if you just can't get enough of Misty or Ruby , who makes a nice blonde and has zee verst jerman akcent ever .  
  In order to avoid confusion , let me clarify a couple of points : I am not a red neck . I am not even a moderate nor a conservative . Quite on the contrary , I am a radical : a Libertarian . I 'm not a WASP either , I was not even born in the States . Jorge Luis Borges used to say that there are some kind of folk who do not feel poetry , and that these sad people usually earn their living teaching poetry . This movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry , by and for show-offs ; and I dare say , by and for people who have no sense of decency or , for that matter , respect for other people 's life or death ( especially when the victims are thought to be mostly ' bloody imperialists ' killed in Yankee soil . ) I even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes , nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive . Just plain awful . Why didn't they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack ? The whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism . Anybody who is serious about film-making ( and serious about life and death ) should have angrily declined to participate in this recollection of innuendoes and non-sequiturs . With two exceptions : the episode of Burkina Faso - almost amusing - , and the one from India - which documents the story of a man who was unfairly and wrongly investigated in relation to the attack , on the basis that afterwards he didn't return home and that he was an American Muslim ( and , truth be told , when the facts were known he was honored as a hero ) . All other nine episodes , essentially and extremely boring and emotionless , can be listed in two different categories : First : ' I don't care about the thousands of victims : Americans , foreigners , children , youngsters , adults , old-timers .. ' and can be resumed in pure boredom and lack of emotion . Makhmalbaf 's ( Iran ) ; Lelouch 's ( France )  I 'm afraid I 'm going to commit an heresy since it 's Lelouch 's , but maybe , his episode might be considered built upon an idea which could be regarded as almost original ; Tanovic 's ( Bosnia-Herzegovina ) ; Gonzalez Inarritu 's ( Mexico ) ; Gitaï 's ( Israel ) ; Penn 's ( USA ) Second : ' The bloody Yankees deserve it ' . And can be resumed in frustration and hatred . Chahine ( Egypt ) vindicates the suicide bombers ; Loach ( UK ) considers the 9/11 reckless attacks were some kind of punishment for the alleged support of the USA to the Chilean dictatorship headed by the serial-killer Augusto Pinochet , in fact someone should inform Mr . Loach that the victims of Pinochet were not related to Al-Qaida and that Chile is a South American country which sole existence Mr . Bin Laden should have ignored , he ought to be informed too that the American government sanctions against the Chilean dictatorship were harder than any other ciountrie 's ; and , Imamura ( Japan ) windingly points out that WWII is related the attack to the WTC . Imamura has at least been coherent in this : the supposed cause effect linking is entirely nonsensical , which plays well with his episode including a man who believes himself to be a snake . It pretends to be obscure . It is , instead , quite ludicrous . There 's some kind of error shared by many , including some Americans , and it consists in the belief that this movie wasn't commercially screened in the States because of some kind of censorship . Nothing further from the truth : This movie wasn't screened in the States because it is a complete fiasco . A fiasco of the wackyest kind . Even in Buenos Aires , where Peronism and other forms of Fascism are nearest and dearest to the hearts of a sizable number of its inhabitants , and anti-Americanism is in vogue , the movie was screened in living rooms hurriedly converted into theaters , and was applauded by a very select public : The usual sad few who routinely lend their applause to other equally ' quaint ' spectacles . Like the sight of a McDonald 's fast-food restaurant or , perchance , an elderly Jew , being burnt to ashes .  
  For the big thinkers among us , " The Intruder " is a maddeningly incoherent movie from France that gives so-called " art films " a bad name . The story is something about a bitter old coot , Louis Trebor ( Michel Subor ) , who goes searching in Tahiti for a heart transplant , but beyond that , I have no idea who any of the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing . With no coherent storyline to boast of , the movie loses us early on , though I 'm perfectly willing to admit that there might be SOMEBODY out there who actually gets some deep message out of this film . This muddled , snail-paced drama runs a full two hours and five minutes - though I seriously doubt anyone with any kind of a life will still be hanging around by the closing credits .  
  First off I 'd like to point out that Sam Niel is nowhere to be seen in this film . What 's a movie without Sam Niel . Did anyone see Event Horizon . D-Wars did have potential a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers does sound cool but sadly isn't . Nope , no Sam Niel , no good movie . I recommend taking the 5 dollars or so it takes to rent D-Wars and adding 10 to that five and buying a Sam Niel film - apparently to submit this i have to have ten lines of text so heres a list of Sam Niel movies i recommend - jurassic park - dead calm - hunt for red October - event horizon - not jurassic park three overall D-Wars is a pile  
  { rant start } I didn't want to believe them at first , but I guess this is what people are talking about when they say South Korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill . After the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie " Gwoemul " ( aka " The Host " ) of 2006 - which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a B-movie genre - successive Korean blockbusters have become more and more generic , even though their budgets ( mainly spent on special effects ) have become more and more fantastic . Do South Korean movie-makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill , which their industry has built up since the 1999 break-out film " Shiri / Swiri " , by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland China did ? { rant end } The only " reason " I can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean / East Asian-styled dragon I have seen to date , for the final scenes . Now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 " Dragonheart " , the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons . Remember " Dungeons & Dragons " in 2000 ? Hasn't anyone learnt that the trick is not how MUCH special effects you use , but how WELL you use it ? I hope there are more ( and better ) Korean legends they can use , because they have just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one . In short , I agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how Koreans felt about having their folk anthem " Arirang " being played at the very end . As a creature feature , I would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it , but I 've seen many video games with better camera work and scripting ( just less dragons ) .  
  Hilarious , laugh out loud moments .. and yet not a comedy . I particularly liked the planted gag of the ambulance soaking the " filthy bum " who then shouts after them in anger " you filthy bums " , I mean wow , someone 's online degree in literature is paying off ! The worst script imaginable , with plot introductions in an instant , ridiculous movement in the story , ZERO character development ( even between the characters who meet .. it 's as if they all have known and trusted each other for years ) dodgy voice over with added echo effects , and plot holes .. oh God are there plot holes ! To be honest I write this not even having watched the entire thing , but I certainly expect the last 30 mins or so to not exactly enhance the already pathetic attempt in cinema .. thank god we 've got a good looking lead to somewhat make us forget that the film is a load of .. well .. use you imagination for the conclusion of that particular sentence !  
  It as absolutely incredible to me that anyone could make the comment that this film is not preachy . It is not only oppressively preachy , but absurd , stagebound , dramatically straight-jacketed , and painfully overwrought . Watching it , one feels like an 8 year old child being punished by having to write " I will not become a fascist " on the blackboard 100 times . Now I understand that it was made during the height of WW2 , and was intended to be a brave condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering he brought about , ( which anyone would whole-heartedly applaud ) and I 'm sure it accurately captured the mood of the day . But it is presented in such an immature , over-obvious , sledgehammer way , it fails abysmally as a work of art . The only good performances here are from Paul Lukas , who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a quietly heroic anti-fascist ; and Lucile Watson as the amusingly ill-mannered rich grandmother who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become . Though their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of hardships , the children are ridiculously shown as robotically well-behaved little snips . They do not even remotely resemble real human beings . And Bette Davis , a great actress , here is so one dimensionally noble I cringed every time she was on screen . Her every word , her every gesture is meant to convey how SUPPORTIVE and UNDERSTANDING she is of the SACRIFICES her husband has to make and the great CAUSE he is fighting for , that she must 've been wired to receive a painful electric shock if she dared allowed any hint of doubt or shading to surface in her portrayal . So yes , this is a very IMPORTANT film , just not a very good one .  
  This movie is likely the worst movie I 've ever seen in my life - surpassing the previous most god-awful movie , " Spawn of Slithis , " which I saw when I was about 10 . Bad acting , stilted and ridiculous dialog , incomprehensible plot , mishmashed cut scenes , even the music was annoying . Did I leave anything out ? Well , the special effects weren't bad - but CGI does not a decent movie make . I can't believe I actually spent money to see this movie . If anyone has the contact info for Hyung-rae Shim ( the director ) , please forward it to my user name " at gmail , " and I 'll contact him to personally demand a refund .  
  The movie was to be shown here in Bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater , it failed miserably . Apparently the story writer just don't hold water . Something was definitely missing . In my opinion people must have a reason why they watch it other than historical glimpse of the past . Accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainment . The movie just lack any substance . The only way to do this movie right was somehow make changes where it stands as some kind of a legend instead of just a story . And a legend will have certain elements that tries to tell you something that people have forgotten through time , such as the meaning of sacrifice , nationalism , etc . It is called the central theme . The movie fails to answer , why would I watch it anyway ? At least some strange legendary Flying Elephants , psychic king , or the eccentric king such as " The King and I " would have been lovely , something would have added greatly to the movies ' appeal . I guess there was no appeal other than a plain vanilla movie . Once you got the appeal , then the story is the next thing we concentrate on . In marketing terms , we call it " must see " . Upon hearing the title of the movie people would say , Oh , I must see it . Now where 's the appeal in Kingmaker ? Why not just redo the title and call it , " How NOT to be a King ? " and make a black comedy of the old Siamese days , to the style of " Dr . Strangelove " . That would have been much more interesting . Narrative-like experiences of the foibles of the King from first persons goofs off would have made the movie extremely funny . Most movies today have that " must see " appeal , such as Spiderman , Men X , these titles speak for themselves . If they don't have familiar characters , some other movies such as , The Island , had an appeal itself when the advertising asks " Do you still believe there is an Island ? " . Or for the movie , retitled " How NOT to be a King " might ask the question , " So do you still WANT to be a King ? " Parhat  
  Warning Spoiler . . . I have to agree with you , it was almost there . This was such a bad movie , about such and interesting true story . It had such promise , but the acting was ridiculous at best . Some sets were beautiful and realistic . Others are something out of a theme park . I found myself laughing as I watched , what was suppose to be , serious scenes . I really wanted to like this movie , but I couldn't . The best part was the fight between friends that ended with the " King " dying . I liked the Queens ' punishment . And , the final shot made a beautiful picture , though . There are so many better movies to watch . I don't recommend this .  
  The Marquis De Sade , Egypt , ancient Gnostic cults , Robert Englund in a dual role , gratuitous sex and nudity , murder and mayhem .. on paper Tobe Hopper 's Night Terrors sounds like it should be at least a fun , entertaining flick given the ingredients . It 's not . It is a plot less , incoherent shambles that brings little entertainment . There is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult that follows the work of De Sade who for some unclear reason feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her . That is pretty much it - I think it has something to with the Gnostics but who knows what the writers were thinking . Most of the movie is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness , dream sequences and erotic encounters , intercut with scenes of Englund as the imprisoned De Sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery . It seems like the makers were trying for something serious but whatever their pretensions were they are buried in the cheesiness , bad acting , sleaze and fake looking decapitated heads . There aren't too many good points . Robert Englund is fun to watch , as always and the lead actress , Zoe Trilling , whilst not very talented , is attractive and in various stages of undress through the movie but watching Night Terrors is a chore . At least I got to see the movie from which the " When you 're as criminal as I " bit from the Australian film certification ratings guide that was on the front of so many VHS tapes from the nineties came from .  
  I only saw this movie once , and that was enough for me . The movie has very little if any plot and seems to be nothing but continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little of anything else . I wanted to see this movie because it starred Zoe Trilling of the second " Night of The Demons ; " and I wanted to see her playing someone normal . Unfortunately , the Tobe Hooper script barely begins and goes nowhere as Robert Englund dominates the film and chews up the scenery and plot . Zoe , I know where you are now ; hiding from this film !  
  The Dereks did seem to struggle to find rolls for Bo after " 10 " . I used to work for a marine park in the Florida Keys . One day , the script for " Ghosts Can't Do It " was circulating among the trainers in the " fish house " where food was prepared for the dolphins . There was one scene where a dolphin supposedly propositions Bo ( or Bo the dolphin ) , asking to " go make eggs . " Reading the script , we lauughed .. We did not end up doing any portion of this movie at our facility , although our dolphins were in " The Big Blue ! " This must have been very close to the end of Anthony Quinn 's life . I hope he had fun in this film , as it certainly didn't do anything for his legacy .  
  I have never watched a movie in so little time . The only salvation was the fast forward function on the DVD unit . It was like watching a poorly produced CBC film . There was obviously no money for lighting , filming , sets , location , scriptwriters , editors , actors .. Oh , there was absolutely no story either ! I need to write ten lines of comment .. Bad , awful , horrible , wretched , anguishing , tortuous , bilious , nauseous , sickening , fromage , disgusting , flimsy , icky , yucky , pukey , stinky , smelly , vile , putrid , all-thumbs-down , and I don't know if I can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crap-o-matic production was !  
  There 's little to get excited about " Dan in Real Life " . First off , the whole setup is incredibly contrived . Did you really believe that during that very long first meeting conversation at the restaurant , Marie wouldn't have told Dan where she was going ? And since Dan did all the talking during that conversation , why would she be so attracted to him ? For that matter , I never figured out why Marie was so attracted to Dan throughout the movie . He 's very narcissistic and does little to convince us that he 's truly a good guy ( for example he lies to Marie in the bookstore , ridicules his brother about his past girlfriends and tries to make Marie jealous with a ' blind date ' ) . There 's more contrivance such as that ridiculous scene at the bowling alley where Dan and Marie are caught making out by the whole family . Yeah like that could really happen . Dan in Real life is slow-paced , sappy and manipulative . Even chick flicks like The Jane Austen Book Club get higher marks than this predictable " tearjerker " .  
  seriously what the hell was this movie about , simply stupid , i 'd give it 0 but , 1 " awful " is the lowest you can go , seriously this movie is not worth watching , waste of time , i don't know what the hell is wrong with you guys voting this movie 7 out of 10 , i seriously can make a better movie than this , hire some other unemployed people , ' n i promise i 'll make a movie better than this , this movie was so bad , that i 'll never watch a movie starring Steve Carrel again , bottom line don't waste your time to download it off the net or rent it , i 'd nominate this movie for the worst movie of the century i mean the worst is Something Gotta give but after that this is the second  
  There was something here with the female lead having this perfect life she 's always wanted after the worst life possible , beginning as a child prostitute and winding up with Eric Roberts . But her background makes it impossible for her to trust Dean Cain and this utterly destroys it in the end . It sounds weird , but I like the position Dean Cain was in at the end and the choice he made . He can't hurt her because he loves her and she 's the mother of his child ( I think the time frame makes it clear it 's his child and not his brother 's ) , but at the same he can't forgive her for all she 's done , sleeping with his brother ( which shows the love and obligation he felt was pretty much one way ) and then being part of his death . In better hands this would have been a better movie , but for something I caught on late night cable , it 's not bad .  
  I like British humor , I believe it 's one of the best in the world . I like almost every British sitcom ( okay .. maybe not Monthy Python , some of the jokes were great , but some of them I didn't understand . ) , but this League of Gentlemen is just something good to make you sick . This show was good in some way ; it helped me lost some weight because watching this piece of garbage make me feel I 'm not hungry anymore . This is really just disgusting , sick and not even funny TV show and I wonder who is actually laughing at this stuff . I watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off . It was so disgusting , watching men dressed in the woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car .. I mean .. what 's so funny about that ? It makes me wanna puke . No humor , just disturbing images and cheap , toilet laughs .. I don't know .. if you like this stuff .. you go ahead .. watch it .. but to be honest , people watching and enjoying this must have some emotional problems . Garbage .  
  The sitcom " The league of Gentlemen " follows the lives of several bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village " Royston Vasey " . The different scenes are linked together by their common setting . In the first series , a sketch show , the main plot deals with a new road which is going to be built through Royston Vasey . Consequently , more foreigners visit the small town . But Edward and Tubbs , the owners of a " local " shop , which is actually far away from the town , do not like foreigners . Whenever a visitor enters their shop , they kill him . In my opinion some scenes are kind of tasteless and not funny at all , for example , when the couple absorb two engineers who want to build the new road . Edward drums , while Tubbs is dancing half naked around the victims . Moreover Pauline lives in Royston Vasey . She works at the local Job Centre . Although Pauline hates the people she has to work with , the woman does not want to loose her job . So when an unemployed man gets an interview as fireman , she does not allow him to go because he is not ready for the job yet . Then there is Barbara Dixton , a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about " her " sexual conversion . Furthermore the vet , Mr . Chinnery , always kills animals instead of curing them . In one case , he comes to a farm and is leaded into the sitting room , where a dog lays in his basket . The farmer goes outside . On the assumption that the dog is the sick animal , Mr . Chinnery euthanizes him . A second later , the farmer opens the door , holding the " real " sick animal , a sheep , in his hand . Some more inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by their nephew ( his friend is killed by the shop owners , by the way ) . The couple is very tidy . They have , for example , towels in different colours . Each colour stands for one part of the body . Besides , they have thousands of keys , marked with different colours and precisely classified . In my opinion , the actors play very well . By playing women , the scenes become comical . The costumes are suited to the actors , too . Tubbs is wearing a scarf and some crazy characters , for example Edward , have unappetizing black teeth . The show has a great deal of dark humour , typical British . The set design reflects the mood of the series . The village and all the houses look grey and are decayed . Around the local shop there is often fog which strengthens the threatening effect . Even the village sign is ominous : " Welcome to Royston Vasey . You will never leave . " Although I think that the actors do a great job , this type of series is not my taste .  
  This movie was recently released on DVD in the US and I finally got the chance to see this hard-to-find gem . It even came with original theatrical previews of other Italian horror classics like " SPASMO " and " BEYOND THE DARKNESS " . Unfortunately , the previews were the best thing about this movie . " ZOMBI 3 " in a bizarre way is actually linked to the infamous Lucio Fulci " ZOMBIE " franchise which began in 1979 . Similarly compared to " ZOMBIE " , " ZOMBI 3 " consists of a threadbare plot and a handful of extremely bad actors that keeps this ' horror ' trash barely afloat . The gore is nearly non-existent ( unless one is frightened of people running around with green moss on their faces ) and the English dubbing is a notch below embarrassing . The plot this time around involves some sort of covert military operation with a bunch of inept scientists ( ie . an idiotic male and his stupid female side-kick ) who are developing some sort of chemical called " Death One " that is supposed to re-animate the dead . Unless my ears need to be checked , I don't even recall a REASON for the research of " Death One " . It seems to EXIST only to wreak havoc upon the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing to ' star ' in this cinematic laugh-fest . Anyway , " Death One " is experimented on a corpse ( whom I swear looked like Yul Brynner ) , and after it is injected into his system , he sits upright and his head explodes ! The sound effects are also quite hilarious - as the corpse 's face bubbles with green slime , the sound of ' paper crumpling ' can be heard . The " Death One " toxin is transported outside and is ' hi-jacked ' by a group of thieves where one makes off with it , but infects himself after cutting himself on an exposed vial . Needless to say , the guy turns into a zombie , but not before he makes his timely escape to a cheap motel , infects a lowly porter and murders a maid by pushing her face into a bathroom mirror ( ! ) . The military catch wind of this and immediately take action before ' eliminating ' everyone who is unlucky enough to be within the ' contamination zone ' and turn the motel upside down . They find the infected thief and burn his body , only to have the smoke infect a flock of birds that are flying over the chimney stack ( ! ) . We cut to the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army , listening to ' groovy music ' that is coming out of a little dinky boom-box while trailing a trailer-load of slutty girls who are leaning out of the windows and showing off their chests . Can someone say " zombie food " ? We also have a sub-plot involving a girl and her boyfriend driving a car who stop to inspect a group of birds lying on the road .. the same birds that were infected by the ' zombie ' smoke ! The birds attack the boyfriend and the girl drives off to a deserted gas station to seek water . This is one of the most incredibly hilarious moments of the movie . She walks around this old dirty , rusty and obviously abandoned building where she continues to ask aloud , " HELLO ? IS THERE ANYONE HERE ? PLEASE , I JUST NEED SOME WATER ! " She encounters a group of zombies , one of which is chained to a wall ( ! ) and the other is swinging a machete . After a bit of rumbling and tumbling around on the ground , she escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with her lighter . Meanwhile , the birds attack the trailer-load of whores and one girl gets pecked and infected . They all pull up to the same motel where the original infection took place , and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film takes place . After a matter of hours ( a day at the most ) , the same motel is now caked in dust , has vines growing throughout it , and looks like it has been sitting derelict for years . Anyway , what better place to take refuge than this particular building ? Needless to say , the group begins to break down as several people walk off together to get themselves stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack . The third most hilarious moment concerns a man and a woman who explore a deserted village , of which the woman comments , " THIS PLACE IS A DUMP ! " She then proceeds to get ' pushed ' off a balcony by a zombie into pirahna ( ? ) infested water where she has her legs bitten off and turns into a zombie within seconds ! Meanwhile , her friend back at the motel who got pecked and infected HOURS earlier is still TURNING into a zombie ! Unfortunately , there are just too many inconsistencies in this movie that makes this movie just too stupid for words . For example , the time rate concerning infected people being ' zombified ' differs greatly . Sometimes it takes seconds , other times it takes hours . Some zombies run , others drag their feet and walk really slow . Some even do kung-fu moves , while others hide under stacks of hay to surprise people . Some of the zombies even talk ! The funniest moment of course is the infamous ' zombie head in the fridge ' gag which ' elevates ' itself in mid-air and ' attacks ' a stupid man who goes looking for food . Funnily enough , his girlfriend gets her throat torn out by it 's ' headless ' counter-part ( LMAO ! ) . The biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of story-lines involving the people who are in fact killed by zombies . We never get to see them come back as zombies , in fact the only ones we do see ' zombified ' are the ones pecked by the birds and the one girl who gets her legs bitten off . Other than that , I was at least expecting the couple who were killed in the kitchen and / or the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as zombies . It is also amazing that these zombies only take a ' few bites ' and then move on to their next victim . The most laughable moment was of course the zombie fetus . A pregnant woman who has been infected lies on a bed in a hospital . A woman who seems to have a lot of ' medical knowledge ' tries to deliver the baby ( ! ) and has her face pulled off by a zombie , before having her head pushed into the woman 's stomach where a hand bursts out and proceeds to rip the rest of her face off . Timeless ! As usual , all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this genre . The megalomaniacal military officer , the pathetic useless squealing women who scream to get killed , the obvious characters who are ABOUT to get killed ( ie . watch for the man chasing a chicken ! ) I guess this movie really is a comedy . There were many laughable scenes , such as the shed that gets blown up with a hand grenade ( obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent ) and a climatic scene where a man screams , " I 'M THIRSTY .. THIRSTY FOR YOUR BLOOD ! " . The costumes are really bad - the same zombies reappear throughout the course of the film , wearing the same ' Asian-like ' clothing that may be found in a Bruce Lee film , and watch out for the blue 60 's skirt the girl at the motel is wearing when she and her boyfriend bump into the infected man . The end of the film leaves open the door as usual for the apocalyptic story-line . A radio DJ who narrates throughout the whole movie turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the ' beginning of the end ' while the two survivors take off in a helicopter . Hardly " DAWN OF THE DEAD " material if you ask me . Regardless , this movie does deliver many laughs . The gore is minimal , and what gore there is , it is very unconvincing , let alone unimaginative . The usual mix of black blood , thick green goo oozing out of weeping sores and ' zombie make-up ' consisting of green moss . " ZOMBI 3 " makes for a good rental for a sleep-over party or a night of beer and popcorn . Other than that , horror fans should stay away . 3 out of 10  
  .. but i expected better from Caroline Munro . She 's done some good films , and i was hoping this would be just as good . as a matter of fact , she and this other blonde girl character ( the girl who got electrocuted i think ) were the only two out of the 8-11 actors who could act . this film has the worst acting i 've ever seen . almost as bad as ' Psycho ' ( 1998 ) . the really dumb part was when the woman was in the shower and marty rigged it to pour battery acid in there . she starts screaming , and her scream is probably the most annoying sound in the whole world . she attempts to get out , but " accidentally " falls back in . i will admit , the violence and story is good , along with harry manfredini 's music , but the acting could 've been a LOT better . there were two other characters , frank and joe . i don't know about you , but they bare a strange resemblance to dan akyroyd . also , when they find that woman 's fried corpse in the bathtub , you would think they 'd be screaming and barfing . No . Caroline Munro and the blonde woman are the only ones who react . Frank and Joe barely show any signs of fear or disgust . i don't know about you , but i know that if i saw a fried skeleton of one of my best friends , i 'd puke . also , when joe starts saying stuff like " what happened to marty was an accident , it wasn't our fault . " he says it like his nervous or scared but barely shows any facial expressions . then the blonde girl starts crying and says " i 'm scared frank ! " . and she grabs joe . i guess the actress really didn't know which guy was which . the film 's ending is the most confusing thing i ever saw . more confusing than the climax of " jaws : the revenge " . all the eight friends end up dead , marty kills them all , but then , you see something that looks like him being chased by their rotted corpses , and then it just cuts to marty still in the hospital from the accident , and then when the film ends , marty dresses up as a nurse trying to sedate him , but then we see that marty has gotten into her clothes or somethin like that kills a doctor , and the film ends with marty peeling skin off his face . which leads me to this next question . WHAT WAS THE WRITER ON WHEN HE CAME UP WITH THAT ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! did he actually expect people to understand just what the hell happened ? the ending left me so confused . were the characters still alive ? is marty still holding a grudge ? did the events we just see not happen yet or not at all ? i don't know . overall , this movie was pretty dumb . the acting sucked , the music was okay , the story was pretty decent ( except for the ending ) . basically , this is just one of your average 80s teen slasher flicks . see it only for harry manfredini and caroline munro . 2/10 P.S. - Simon Scuddamore ( Marty ) committed suicide shortly after the film 's release from intentional drug abuse . i guess he was the only person who knew this film was what it really was . A PILE OF SH *  
  This is the worst documentary to come out of Canada ever ! I 'm glad to see the guys haven't made another movie . All they want to do is get a movie made and it doesn't have to be the one they wrote . They keep changing the script to suite the person they 're pitching . I could not get out of the theatre fast enough when I saw it at that year 's Toronto Film Festival . Please never see this film .  
  I do not know if this movies problems are more the fault of Direction or Script . As you will see in many reviews the editing style is way overdone . It is absolutely distracting and without substance , which could be considered a good thing if you look at some of the quotes from the movie . I do not write many reviews here , but felt this movie was so awful that it deserved comment . Movies like this erode at Movie making as an Art form . Movies like this one show more and more clearly that the current Reality focus in cinema is revealing the quality of the characters behind them . People hone there craft , there 5 senses , and there business sense - overlooking there own inner life . However I do not put blame on them , it is more and more the unfortunate condition of this age - qualified by films like this one . But by proxy these Manufacturers I would dare not call Artists vomit there lack of inner life or regard onto the screen - diffusing it to everyone . A story of bounty hunters , guns guns and more guns , heavy handed flaunting of sex - for the oh so popular actress ( did they write the lap dance scene after they signed her ? ) , over saturated , over exaggerated , one liners , non-linear plots . All different and yet all the same . Annoying overwhelming music to push the emotion down your throat . A story ? a development of character ? or just withheld , missing information , revealed at the end to create the * effect * of a story - as if one took place . It altogether lacks anything remotely resembling subtlety . It is a caricature of stereotypes and genre . Where are the films with Awareness ? What about subtlety of sound and music that you are not even aware is there ? What about the depth of a look ? What about editing with a point about mind and consciousness ? yes even in action films this can happen . Sure they have honed a craft ; but what use is it without soul or wisdom ? of insight into the human condition ? Can the people who commented and said that this is an apogee of art , or compare this to Picasso and others - I say put this next to Gandhi or the Godfather , even the original trilogy of star wars or the lord of the rings ; then look me in the face and say it again . It is a good crew , but they need some help with depth and story . I hope they get it because I like the crews previous work . better luck next time .  
  This movie was absolutely ghastly ! I cannot fathom how this movie made it to production . Nothing against the cast of the movie , of course , this is all the fault of the writing team . You take the old average plot - let 's dance our way out of being poor and destitute - or STEP in this case . But this one lacks any semblance of a true plot - or at least one that anyone would care about . With Canadian speaking actors in what is supposed to be an American setting - this film falls very flat . On a positive note , the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well . Looks like the production budget was very generous as well . My only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find actual screenwriters to help them bring words alive on film . Net result - How she move is How she sucks .  
  Wow . Who ever said that Edward D . Wood Jr . never influenced anybody ? This steaming pile of donkey excrement is a perfect case in point ; it makes " The Violent Years " look like " Casablanca " ! " Santa Claus " also makes Keith Richards ' worst flashbacks look like my first nocturnal emission . I 've had nightmares , you know , waking up and sweating bullets , that will never come close to the visceral terror that Santa Claus unearthed from the seemingly pure soil of my very being . However , I can think of some parties where this film might actually go over well . Also , if you 're looking for the perfect example of a Santa-Satan dichotomy on VHS tape , look no further . Don't check out this movie , as I 've been notified the MST3K version is now available . Move over Satan , here 's " Santa Claus " .  
  Pictures that usually glorify a hero have meaning . As an example , Bonnie and Clyde glorified the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds . Why ? They were two people caught up in the depression when people were desperate to survive . This film has absolutely no substance . The Viggo Mortensen character soon emerges as a folk hero . Why ? He speeds along an Idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his stricken wife has been taking . No one bothers to understand why he is trying to flee everyone . Even worse , when the realization becomes apparent that he is not a red-neck terrorist , no one in government wants to help him as they try to save their rear ends . Jason Priestley co-stars as a radio emcee who builds upon the story in support of our hero . The ending is absolutely unbelievable .  
  .. Bad at being intentionally bad .. This little gem shot straight onto the MST3k big screen . While it 's obvious the movie isn't trying to be taken seriously ( Hopefully that their goal , anyway .. ) , the movie is still plain bad . Hell , it makes Leprechaun In Space look big budgeted .. In short : Paint my muscle car prune colored !  
  Woody Allen made " September " , proving that even a genius could screw up . This is Mel Brook 's " September " . Monumentally stupid , boring , and unfunny , I must confess I did not watch it through to the end . The flick ranks among the dishonored few ( e . g . , " The Money Pit " , " Out to Sea " , " Spitfire Grill " ) which either put me to sleep or forced me to reach for the " rewind " button . And I say this , sadly , as a devoted Mel Brooks fan . He should stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone . How the same fellow that made " Young Frankenstein " and " Spaceballs " could crank out a dog like this is beyond me . To be avoided at all costs .  
  An archaeologist ( Casper Van Dien ) stumbles accidentally upon an ancient , 40 foot mummy , well preserved underground in the Nevada desert . They are determined to keep this a secret and call in a Jewish translator to assist in figuring out the history of it . The mummy , as explained at the beginning , is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants that apparently existed in " those days " . In order to save his son from a devastating flood which was predicted to kill everything , he mummifies his son , burying him with several servants for centuries - planning to awaken him years from then . In our present , the fallen angels still walk the earth and the mummy is resurrected and a ritual is expected to take place . Most of the movie is slow , having to do with a lot of biblical crap and a couple lousy , air-punching fights . The mummy is decent looking but isn't shown nearly enough . It should have had more to do with that but it dragged on a great deal so .. eh . Don't bother .  
  Look , there 's nothing spectacularly offensive about this film , it 's just boring . It 's a typical rom-com with an ending you can see coming before you 've seen so much as the trailer . The key difference is that the classic rom-coms tackle their stories with wit and a lack of pretension . This movie has no pretension but it really has no sense of movement , you feel as though you could get up and walk away at any moment . The production of the movie also has the feel of a debut movie made about fifteen years ago . I 'd recommend re-watching a classic movie like When Harry Met Sally instead of this shallow imitation . Oh , one other BIG problem .. no chemistry . If you 're used to seeing Michael looking all cute as Vaughn in Alias , you 're going to be seriously disappointed with the way they 've made him look here .  
  There have been some funny movies about spirits to come out of Hollywood . Cary Grant was an angel in " The Bishop 's Wife " ( 1947 ) . Of course the best were the Topper movies in the late ' 30s-early ' 40s . And , more recently , Warren Beatty 's " Heaven Can Wait " ( 1978 ) , which was a remake of 1941 's " Here Comes Mr . Jordan . " These were well-written , funny , entertaining comedies , all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels . Now comes writer-director Jeff Lowell , making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable , bitchy young woman , Kate ( Eva Longoria Parker ) , who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the fledgling spiritualist , Ashley ( Lake Bell ) who is falling for Kate 's fiancé , Henry ( Paul Rudd ) . One thing that is clear at the outset : Longoria Parker is no Constance Bennett ( Marion Kerby in the first two " Topper " films ) , who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measured . There is a line right at the beginning when Henry 's sister , Chloe ( Lindsay Sloane ) tells Henry , " You don't smile . " That aptly described my situation throughout this film . The main problem with the film is that the script just isn't very funny . But it 's made worse by Longoria Parker 's presence that just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen . Just to start out with , compounding her lack of comedic talent , she is covered with so much pancake makeup , who knows what she really looks like ? Kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue . She 's so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about walks out on her ( well , she actually just fades out ) , so Kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is . Chloe wants Henry to snap out of the funk into which he has naturally descended after Kate 's death ( from what I saw of Kate , he should have felt a wonderful relief ) , so she introduces him to Ashley , who really doesn't know what she 's doing as a spiritualist ( she is also a cateress to make ends meet ) , to see if she can get Henry back in touch with Kate . There 's a lot of meshugaas that goes on . The vacuity of the film is epitomized by a " B " story revolving around Ashley 's assistant , Dan ( Jason Biggs ) . This is thrown in near the end , but the way Ashley handles it indicates that she 's as much of a boob as Kate . Since Dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women , he deserves whatever he gets . Eventually Kate appears to Ashley and the fun should begin . It doesn't , and more 's the pity because in other hands this could have been pretty funny . As it is , Norman Z . McLeod , Constance Bennett , Roland Young , Alan Mowbray , and Co . must be turning over in their graves to see this is what their brilliance in the first two " Topper " films has wrought .  
  This movie is similar to the play entitled ' Blithe Spirit ' written by Noel Coward . The plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to Coward 's writing . I 'm surprised that movies of this nature don't acknowledge the original writer 's concept . I realize that the public may not be aware that this is a knockoff but it is . Sad . These movies are so expensive to produce . I do perk up when a screenplay is original . I even perk up when it 's an innovative way to produce a work that was previously released . There were some samples mentioned ( such as Topper , etc . ) . I realize that movies are still a comparatively affordable form of entertainment . However , I 'm not please when the public 's taste is taken for granted . In this situation , the public 's taste is overlooked . I look forward to better produced movie entertainment . In this case . I rather see the play .  
  There 's really no way to beat around the bush in saying this , Lady Death : The Motion Picture just plain sucks . Aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence , the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980 's cartoon based on a line of action figures . The bad guy himself even talks like a Skeletor wannabe , has the obligatory inept henchman , and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon . Just don't expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue . At other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai , yet there is no sex , no tentacle rape ( Thank goodness ! ) and very little sex appeal , this despite the physical appearance of the title character . There is simply no adult edge to this material , unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths . Essentially , what we have here is a feature length episode of She-Ra , Princess of Power , but with skimpier clothes and more gore .  
  There 's nothing amazing about ' The Amazing Mr Williams ' . Part of this movie 's problem is its lead actor Melvyn Douglas . He was a lousy actor and lazy with it . For most of his career , he allowed his good looks , a glib manner and ( usually , but not in this movie ) some fine scriptwriting to make up for his lack of acting ability . I disliked Douglas as an actor before I knew anything about him as a person ; I 've learnt enough about him to know that I also despise his politics . I 'll give Melvyn Douglas credit for one thing : his chromosomes did produce the incredibly talented and sexy actress Illeana Douglas . Melvyn Douglas made this movie right after the brilliant ' Ninotchka ' .. talk about a comedown ! ' The Amazing Mr Williams ' is allegedly a comedy , but I never laughed . Douglas plays a plainclothes detective on the homicide squad , named Kenny Williams . I never heard of a police detective named Kenny , but if they called him Kenneth Williams .. well , what a carry-on . The whole city is in a panic because a serial killer is going about , killing women . No motive is given for this ; he just likes to kill women . The mayor ( Jonathan Hale , better than usual ) calls Williams on the carpet to account for his failure to catch the killer . SPOILERS APPROACHING . The cheap , vulgar , untalented and unattractive Joan Blondell plays the mayor 's secretary . ( She doesn't sound literate enough to file a letter , much less type one . ) Blondell and Douglas squabble like a cat and a dog , so it 's blatantly obvious they 're going to end up together . At this movie 's lowest point , Melvyn Douglas decides to draw out the killer by dressing up as a woman . You do NOT want to see Melvyn Douglas in drag ! He 's well over six foot , and he doesn't even shave off that annoying moustache . The similarly-'tashed William Powell was an actor very similar in type to Melvyn Douglas ( but much more talented ) . When Powell disguised himself as a woman in ' Love Crazy ' , he had the integrity to shave off his moustache : a genuine sacrifice , as Powell needed it to grow in again for his next role . But Melvyn Douglas brings nothing whatever to his role in this movie , not even a razor . He plays his drag scenes with the same annoying smirk he used throughout the bulk of his career . On the plus side , ' The Amazing Mr Williams ' has several of those splendid supporting players who made Hollywood 's movies of the ' 30s so delightful . Edward Brophy is brilliant here , touching and funny as a criminal who gets an unlikely furlough from his life sentence . The dyspeptic Donald MacBride is fine as a cop who gets mistaken for the killer , and is nearly lynched by a mob . Ruth Donnelly is splendid : as usual for her , but here she gets a chance to show her talents away from her usual orbit on the Warner Brothers backlot . Jimmy Conlin , Luis Alberni and the grinning Dave Willock are all fine in small roles . Barbara Pepper ( whom I usually dislike ) is good here too . The grossly unpleasant Maude Eburne gets some screen time ; I always loathe her , and she gives the same performance in every film .. but some audiences enjoy Eburne 's one-note performance very much , for reasons I can't fathom . If you 're familiar with Hollywood character actors of the 1930s , and the roles they tended to play , one glance at IMDb 's cast list will tell you who the murderer is . That 's the problem with ' The Amazing Mr Wiliams ' : everything is too obvious . I 'll rate this movie 2 points out of 10 .  
  It feels like swedish movies are trying to become more american and I just don´t get it . In this movie the performance of some of the actors is horrible and the script is nothing special . Don´t waste your time !  
  Saving Grace is surely one of the leading contenders for the ' How to Ruin an Adequate Film in the Final Few Minutes ' award . Naturally if you mix a quaint Cornish village - largely populated by retired genteel ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana , a certain amount of silliness will ensue . However , the last seven minutes of the film descend into the totally ludicrous and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny . It is a real shame , because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as 1998 's Waking Ned Devine , which also portrayed a picturesque small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to extract themselves from a tricky situation . The protagonist of Saving Grace is middle-aged , recently widowed Grace Trevethyn , whose husband 's legacy of bad debts has forced her into an unconventional way of earning money . Helped by her gardener , Matthew , she turns her horticultural expertise to the lucrative cultivation of marijuana . Unfortunately , this leads her into confrontation with the local police , her husband 's creditors and a French drug baron . . . . . . . . . . whom all turn up at her greenhouse simultaneously . The relationship and rapport between Grace and Matthew is well-portrayed , and Brenda Blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved with her likeable character - you can really feel what she is going through . The casting of the minor roles is excellent , even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric . However , the transformation of Jacques the drug lord into Grace 's romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all . And surely hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing ? Sadly the film swaps gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants .  
  Reading through all these positive reviews I find myself baffled . How is it that so many enjoyed what I consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite Jane Austen novel ? There are many problems with the film , already mentioned in a few reviews ; simply put it is a hammed-up , over-acted , chintzy mess from opening credits to butchered ending . While many characters are mis-cast and neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette puts in a performance that is worthy of them , the worst by far is Paltrow . I have very much enjoyed her performance in some roles , but here she is abominable - she is self-conscious , nasal , slouching and entirely disconnected from her characters and those around her . An extremely disappointing effort - though even a perfect Emma could not have saved this film .  
  I purchased this movie at a car boot sale , so I was not expecting it to be a horror movie on the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street ( 1984 ) or The Hills Have Eyes ( 1977 ) but I thought that it would still be fairly enjoyable to watch . However , it proved to be not at all enjoyable , but instead the acting and the general movie was mock-able , such as the ways the the ' unsees killer ' murders his victims and how all of the people killed just happen to be young blonde women . It was a stereotypical horror film . I say this because of the following reasons : 1 ) Three blonde women in danger , the majority get killed . 2 ) One survives by crawling around in the dark while being chased by the killer . 3 ) Surprise surprise , help arrives in the form of a shotgun ! By using three simple points , I have saved you two odd hours by summarising this poor excuse of a horror movie , so you are now lucky enough to not have to watch it .  
  I am not sure why I like Dolph Lundgren . I guess seeing him on screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent . That is a good feeling for all of us who lack talent . Some of the other reviews point out how dumb Detention is , but many neglect to point out the positives . Any movie where at least one annoying teenager gets killed can't be all bad . Why do so many movies that have a cast of teens always need to include the stereotypical teens ? Aren't there any other kind of teens ? Does every group of teens have one angry black guy ? One genius nerd that nobody likes ? One slutty girl who is very friendly and ( in this movie ) pregnant ? One disturbed anti-social white kid from a broken home who everyone agrees is talented ( but what is the talent ? ) . And one laid-back black kid who is in tune with the Universe and so cool that all the other neurotic kids trust him . Then add a couple of generic expendable teens of any color . They don't say much but get shot at some point . Detention would have been better if the bad guys had gotten to blow up the school . Preferably with the writers inside . The dialogue is bad , and the plot is worse . When the bad guys ( and girl ) finally hijack a van full of drugs , then they sit inside the van making out . They drive the van to the school because they want to re-paint the van at the school 's paint shop , but they never get around to re-painting the van . By the way , it would have been easier to just put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or a truck and drive away without repainting the Police Van . They also never move the drugs or sell them or do anything else with the big score . For some reason , they decide they have to kill the kids and the teacher ( Dolph Lundgren ) even though when the villains take over the school nobody is remotely aware of it because it is after school hours . The handful of people still in the school have nothing to do with painting vehicles , so why go after them ? Anyhow , the best part of this movie is that the villains are all armed with numerous machine guns , and they keep finding the teens ( including a guy in a wheel chair ) and they keep shooting hundreds of bullets at the teens and usually miss . Towards the end of the movie there is some bloodshed . For every time someone gets shot , there must be at least three hundred bullets fired that miss . The stunts are pretty bad . I read one of the reviews that says that this movie had a budget of $ 10 Million , and I am amazed . When I saw the movie I figured maybe Lundgren had done it as some kind of charity work for some film school where he is the teacher . Like maybe this movie was their end of the year exam . It was a test to watch it , but I passed .  
  It 's my opinion that when you decide to re-make a very good film , you should strive to do better than the original ; or at least give it a fresh point of view . Now the 1963 Robert Wise telling of Shirley Jackson 's remarkable novel " The Haunting of Hill House " is worth the price of admission even today . Now fast forward to 1999 and the re-make . I was left shaking my head and asking , why ? The acting is wooden , the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate . I had heard that this update was bad ; but couldn't believe it was that bad , considering the source material . I was wrong . After watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was , she said ; " Well they got your money ! " She 's right , don't let them get yours . If there 's no profit in making lousy re-makes , maybe they 'll stop making them or come up to a higher standard that doesn't insult their audience  
  A pale shadow of a great musical , this movie suffers from the fact that the director , Richard Attenborough , completely misses the point of the musical , needlessly " opens " it up , and muddies the thrust of the play . The show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a B'way musical and examines their drive & desire to work in this demanding and not-always-rewarding line of work . Attenborough gives us a fresh-faced cast of hopefuls , assuming that they are trying to get their " big break " in show business , rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working " gypsies " living show to show , along with a couple of newcomers . The film has one advantage over the play and that is the opening scene , showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to the 16/17 on the line ( depending on how you count Cassie , who is stupidly kept out of the line in the movie ) . Anyone who can catch a local civic light opera production of the play will have a much richer experience than seeing this poorly-conceived film .  
  i was lucky enough to see A Chorus Line when it came to my city .. i was younger then .. but it was an Excellent play .. so would someone please tell me why in heavens name did they have to make a movie out of it .. and why Michael Douglas ? He didnt suit the role .. this movie really sucked BIG time ! my advise is NOT to rent this movie .. save your money for something better like " Cats " ..  
  I was in second grade , 12 years ago . I remember it clearly . We were learning about space . All little kids want to go to space , right ? Well , after I saw this , I was so scared to death that I would ' accidentally ' get flung into space by some psychotic robot with a one track mind . I had no idea that this was a movie . I thought it was some news program or something . I guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program ' War of the Worlds . ' So , recently , I get this movie again to watch , realizing my favorite actor , Joaquin Phoenix was in it ( then known as Leaf Phoenix ) . I can tell you , I was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting . I mean , when Andy is in space , she moves in slow motion , did you ever notice that ? I don't think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow . The best part is when Andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank , and begins to float backwards as the security doors close . Little Max is trying to pull her in . Suddenly , we get a major close up on Max 's face as he shouts ( in slow motion ) " Whaatt'ss happeniinngg ? ! ? ! ? " I had no idea .  
  Mercifully , there 's no video of this wannabe western that a stay-afloat vehicle for Big Frank at a time when his career was floundering . The story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a back-room writer . All in all , this show stinks . The story is basically boring , ill-conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence . I must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it " .. underrated .. " The critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so . You 'll have to catch it on the last show , if you up late and having a bout of insomnia . But , if you can sit through it , you 've more fortitude than most of my movie buff friends .  
  This movie is a crappy and forgettable Sean Connery vehicle . The performances are generally crappy especially by Capshaw , Fishburne , and the usually solid Ed Harris . Connery seems miscast as a Harvard Academic . The movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along . It is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels . The movie squanders an excellent supporting cast . George Plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to Connery as they debate the death penalty . The violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery / thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree . The scripting and direction are extremely poor . Connery 's charisma and screen presence are the film 's only virtue . Manipulative , Violent , and Ridiculous . 2/10 Avoid It .  
  Basically a typical propaganda film for the last good war . But there were a couple things that struck me . First was the use of mouthed epithets . In two cases the Scott character mouths one , once at the beginning when he drops his bomb off target during the bomb-off ( " dammit " ) and once when he is trying to sway a bombardier into being a pilot ( " s * % t " ) . I could be wrong about the second instance but I replayed it several times and that 's what it looks like to me . The third case is when the Anne Shirley character wishes the O'Brien character goodbye and good luck ( " Give ' em hell " ) over the roar of the engines . She must have thought that was too unladylike because she clearly says " heck " . I also found interesting the character that has moral problems with bombing , specifically bombing civilians . The avuncular superior officer assures him that only military targets will be hit due to the precision of the bombsight used . Given what we know about the LeMay 's later strategy of firebombing Japanese cities into oblivion this scene plays with not a little irony . I remember McNamara 's quoting of LeMay in " The Fog of War " , something to the effect that if the US did not win the conflict he would be tried as a war criminal . The ending is way overwrought , in keeping with the movie . It reminded me a bit of the end of White Heat ( I 'm not comparing the films , just the ending ! ) . Maybe it 's just ' cause he gets blowed up . Blowed up real good !  
  Ritchie 's first two films were snappy , stylish entertainment . Here , he raids two recent classics  ' The Usual Suspects ' and ' Fight Club '  and still comes out empty-handed . Despite parading itself as a con-mystery ( with the sub-'Usual Suspects ' twaddle " the greatest con he ever pulled was convincing you that he was you " or whatever it was .. ) and attempting a ' Fight-Club ' twist about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations , the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half . By the last third , you know you 're being lead down a blind alley , and tediously slowly at that . Cons , chess and game theory are all great subjects , but Ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material . The only thing that keeps the movie ( almost ) watchable is Ritchie 's bold way with with a scene and Maurice-Jones 's dynamic camera . If Ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot , and succumbed to tighter editing , there 's no reason why he couldn't have made another enjoyable gangster caper . As it is , Revolver is a waste of your time . Incomprehensibility does not equal profundity . If you want to see a great film that doesn't make logical sense but makes a virtue of it ( and , incidentally , which also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement ) watch ' Lost Highway ' .  
  Now , I haven't read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here , so I 'm not going to go down that path here . But I have some time ago learnt that Stephen King movies simply - are not - horror films , with perhaps a couple of exceptions . This was not one of them . It started well enough , and for once I 'm not going to complain about the acting , although Fred Gwynne was as usual wonderful .. Also I will forgive the total lack of parenting skills , as they were necessary to make the story here move forward .. But there was one consistent point that I couldn't help but get annoyed with . And that came pretty close to the end of the movie , and at least 2 characters partook in the activity of dumb stupidity . The moments I refer to are thus : There is a tiny zombie running around the house . You suspect it is under the bed . Do you ( a ) get as close to the bed as you can before blindly raising the duvet cover up , exposing pretty much your whole body to whatever damage such a teeny undead cannibal might inflict on you , or ( b ) move a little away from the bed so you can peer under the completely open end from a position of slightly increased safety , or at least see the mini terror coming at you , giving you a little reaction time . I know , let 's go with ( a ) . I feel like offering myself up for the slaughter today . Bleh Fun enough film though .. Just not very scary .  
  A family with dad Louis ( Dale Midkiff ) , mom Rachel ( Denise Crosby ) , 10 year old Eileen ( Blaze Berdalh and about 3 year old Gage ( Miko Hughes ) move to this beautiful house in Maine-seemingly unaware of the semis that roar down the highway in front of their house every 90 seconds or so ! The neighbor across the way ( the wonderful Fred Gwynne ) makes them feel at home .. and shows them a pet cemetery where children bury their pets . But a little further on is a sacred ground which can bring the dead back to life .. but the dead come back in a nasty mood . " DEFINITE SPOILERS * The novel by Stephen King was good-it was long but it developed characters and situations that made you care what happened . This movie jettisons ALL the character development and just plays up the gore and violence . Animals are killed ON camera ( I know it 's faked but it 's still repulsive ) ; a little boy is hit by a semi and his casket pops open during the funeral ( in a totally sick scene ) ; he 's brought back to life and attacks and kills people including his mom ( I DO wonder how a 3 year old was able to hang her ) ; a ghostly jogger ( don't ask ) tries to help the family for no reason .. The movie just works the audience over shoving every gruesome death or violence into your face . It just goes out of its way to shock you . * END SPOILERS * Acting is no help . Midkiff is just dreadful as the father-he 's handsome and buff but totally blank . Crosby isn't much better . The two kids are just annoying . Only Gwynne single-handedly saves this picture with his effortless good acting . This picture shows a total contempt for the audience taking large leaps in logic and having characters do incredibly stupid things ( especially Midkiff at the end ) . This movie was ( inexplicably ) a huge box office hit in 1989 which led to the even worse sequel in 1992 . I saw it in a theatre back then and was disturbed how the audience kept cheering on the violence and was just appalled by what I saw . A sick repulsive horror film . A 1 all the way . When you think it 's all over and can't get worse the Ramones sing a title song ! ( " I don't wanna be buried in a pet cemetery " ) . Truly beyond belief .  
  Umm .. I was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high marks . Lets face it .. Tori Spelling is not a great actress .. and this movie just proves the extent of her " talent " . The movie 's plot was weak .. I bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverted peeping tom . If there is a good thing about this movie , I would say it 's that Tommy Chong 's daughter , just for the fact that she 's his daughter .. and then there is that Soap-Opera-ish male lead who 's decent good looks somewhat make him attractive , but ceases to help his dramatic abilities . * Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines ? How many more ways can you simply say " This movie sucks " ?  
  Nut case is murdering college students , can new teacher stop the madness ? ! Believe me , you won't care . With a title like Splatter University , one would immediately gather that this movie just isn't high art . But worse than that Splatter University doesn't even qualify for amusing garbage . Splatter U is so poorly made - the story is mindless , the characters are throw-aways , and the whole movie lacks any essence of imagination . Needless to say there is no suspense or atmosphere or scares . This drivel isn't even brave enough to throw in any nudity ( for the cheapest thrill of all ) . So all around this endlessly flawed slasher offers nothing in the way of entertainment ( not even cheap laughs ) and just becomes a complete bore . Bottom of the barrel folks - even die hard slasher fans will want to think twice before viewing , let alone paying money for this flick . BOMB out of *  
  Really , really bad slasher movie . A psychotic person escapes from an asylum . Three years later he kills a sociology professor , end of scene . One semester yesterday later ( hey , that 's what the title card said ) a new sociology professor is at the school . She makes friends with another female sociology professor who works there , and starts dating another professor . The students are all bored , as are we . There are a number of title cards indicating how much time has passed . Scenes are pretty short , and cut to different characters somewhere else , making for little progression of any kind . A lot of scenes involve characters walking and talking , or sitting and talking , and serve little purpose . Despite the passage of time , many of the characters are always wearing the same clothing . Sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see a body for the second time , we ask ourselves : how long has that body been there ? And also , at least one of the dead people don't seem to have been missed by others . The killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the breast , another by stabbing him in the crotch , and another by slicing her forehead . Is his knife poisoned or something ? The video box cover has a cheerleader : there aren't any in the movie . The rear cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown menacing a group of women in a dorm room . The central redhead in the photo is in the movie , but nobody ever wears such an outfit , and there is no such scene . The killer is strictly one-on-one .  
  No laughs whatsoever . Yes , I watched this entire train wreck but only so that I wouldn't later wonder if Cleese had come to his senses in the latter part . ( No , he had not . ) This may be historically interesting to you youngsters out there , to see that British " humor " included black " jokes " like these , thirty years ago . What amazes me even more though , is to read the other reviewers ' comments , which acknowledge this isn't very good , yet then turn around and give it high votes . If the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even much worse than this one , then I certainly pity your torturous existences . The humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids , yet the subject matter does not . So who is this for ? People who enjoy repeated & drawn-out double-takes , pratfalls , drug jokes ( interesting only as a short trip back to ' 77 ) , and other " low " humor . The Three Stooges are still funny , and were to me as a kid , too . THEY exerted some effort in making jokes work . This however is sloughed off schlock . I fear that it IS the end of civilization , if this stuff really is accepted as worthwhile . Next you 'll be telling me that tabloid TV is popular . : (  
  The French film " Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte " directed by iconoclast film maker Philippe Harel is based on the book of the same name written by a controversial writer Michel Houellebecq . He has also worked on this film 's scenario . According to British cinema magazine Sight and Sound , it is also known as " Whatever " . This film has been hailed as a breath of fresh air for French cinema due to its not so common theme of sexual politics and its implications on two stupid information technology workers . The film is marred by its much too evident voice over which introduces us to the main character . This makes us viewers feel as if we are watching a book that is bring read . The basic premise of problems related to loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is fine but the film goes out of hand once the hero starts recounting the misery faced by him and his friend . Instead of sticking to its main topic the film veers in other directions leading to its downfall . Beware : some women viewers might find not only the film but even its two heroes as moronic misogynists .  
  First of all my heartfelt commiserations to anyone who bought a cinema ticket in the hope of seeing a film in the same mould as the fantastic Gregory 's Girl and Local Hero but ended up leaving the theatre feeling disappointed and vaguely cheated . While it 's true that sequels are usually , bar a few notable exceptions , a mistake and exist merely to provide studio executives with an opportunity to cash in on the success of a previous film by offering us either a thinly disguised retread of the original story or a plot line so far removed from the intentions of the original that the resulting film makes no sense . In the case of Gregory 's Two Girls , Bill Forsyth has the dubious honour of managing to commit both sins - on the one hand revisiting the plot of Gregory 's Girl , while at the same time serving up a frankly incredible and moronic storyline involving Scottish arms dealers . Schoolboy Gregory is now a teacher at the same school where at the tender age of sixteen , he harboured a hopeless passion for the football playing Dorothy . Although now thirty five , Gregory still harbours a hopeless passion but now for the football playing Frances , also sixteen , despite the fact that music teacher , Bel has made it clear that she is attracted to him . His passion for Frances and his desire to impress her lead to his involvement in a scheme to expose a local arms dealer who also happens to be an old schoolfriend . There 's no point in going any further as the rest of the story is forgettable and the ending makes no real sense at all . The main problem lies with the character of Gregory himself , in that there is no sign of the endearing and charming sixteen year old Gregory who actively and comically pursues Dorothy convinced that he would eventually win her over . At thirty five , Gregory is presented to us as a rather sad and friendless creature whose life is neither active nor comic . Outside of work his time is spent watching videos of Noam Chomsky and reading magazines about international injustices . As his friends and family from the previous film have seemingly vanished , save two pointless scenes with his younger sister , who no longer offers him advice or seems at all interested in his life , we are left confused about what it is Gregory really wants , who he is and why he is the way he is . Why for example is he friendless ? Why does he never see his father , who is clearly still alive ? Why has he returned to teach at the school he once attended ? Why is he so interested in Noam Chomsky and injustice ? Why has he become so apathetic ? Why is he attracted to Frances ? Why isn't he attracted to Bel until the last twenty minutes of the film ? What in heaven 's name do Bel or Frances see in him as he is neither drop dead gorgeous or even interesting ? Why does he continue to try and impress Frances even after he and Bel have become an item and when their association threatens to completely disrupt his life ? Are we really to believe that a Scottish arms dealer openly selling weapons of torture to oppressive regimes could manage to evade media scrutiny but fall foul of a couple of school-kids ? Does Gregory really think that dumping a handful of computers into the sea will change anything ? To make matters worse , actor John Gordon Sinclair attempts to rehash his performance as the adolescent Gregory right down to the facial expressions and awkward body language . Unfortunately on a thirty five year old it just comes across as odd and vaguely creepy . On top of that , it 's hard to feel any sympathy for , or empathy with a teacher who has erotic dreams involving sex with one of their uniform wearing pupils while they both lie on a pile of gym mats . Rather than being amusing it simply smacks of paedophilia . It 's hard to know what was going through Bill Forsyth 's head when he wrote this script or why he thought fans of the original film would embrace a story so completely lacking in the charm , wit and warmth that turned the first movie into a classic . I can only assume that the plan was to craft a film about a man who was refusing to grow up and commit to adult life and perhaps whose happiest memory was of being sixteen and pursuing the best looking girl in the school but who by degrees is forced to accept that a life lived in the past is no life at all . That at least could have been the basis of a film which was thematically interesting and intelligent . As it is Gregory 's Two Girls adds up 116 wasted and pointless minutes saying nothing and signifying even less . Gregory 's Girl was responsible for launching Bill Forsyth 's career , here 's hoping that Gregory 's Two Girls won't be responsible for sinking it .  
  Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade . I haven't seen it since . I just watched the trailer though . Does this look like a first grade movie to you ? I don't think so . I was so horrified by this movie , I could barely watch it . It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half , and then there was the boy with ketchup ! I was freaked out by this film . Now today , being 20 , I probably would not feel that way . I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn't see this movie , even though it 's PG . Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids . I don't even remember what it was about , once was enough !  
  W . Somerset Maugham 's Of Human Bondage is supposed to be a English language classic . If so , much must have been missing from the film version here . Phillip 's ( Leslie Howard ) attraction to Mildred ( Bette Davis ) is so utterly inexplicable as to make the scenario seem like the post-breakup retelling of a relationship from the man 's point of view . Being a family lawyer I 've heard many such accounts ; the man depicts himself as noble and always correct , and the woman is a hellion who has had no other objective than to exploit the man . Indeed , unless one is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of the film maker , this is an uncomfortable movie to watch . Phillip even indulges Mildred when she brings over a baby of indeterminate paternity , but the real high point comes when Phillip allows Mildred - enraged and now of dubious sanity - the free run of his flat , with predictable results . Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life , but that period didn't occur here . In fact , by the end of the movie she looks a lot like the Baby Jane character she would play thirty years later . I note how Howard 's character is always impeccably dressed and groomed . It tells me that Phillip craves middle class respectability . Someone like that could not run from a woman with a course Cockney accent fast enough . Phillip is , for most of the movie , a student ; such a person would have been more believable if he had been younger , and had the disheveled looks that bespeak the low income and the low self esteem that often accompanies student status - an English Raskolnikov , as it will . And balanced that by allowing Mildred a modicum of charm .  
  The film is almost laughable with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters teaming up as the mothers of convicted murderers . With the horrible notoriety after the trial , the two women team up and leave N.Y. for California in order to open and song and dance studio for Shirley Temple-like girls . From the beginning , it becomes apparent that Reynolds has made a mistake in taking Winters with her to California . Winters plays a deeply religious woman who increasingly seems to be going off her rocker . To make matters worse , the women who live together , are receiving menacing phone calls . Reynolds , who puts on a blond wig , is soon romanced by the wealthy father of one of her students , nicely played by Dennis Weaver . Agnes Moorehead , in one of her last films , briefly is seen as Sister Alma , who Winters is a faithful listener of . The film really belongs to Shelley Winters . She is heavy here and heaviness seemed to make her acting even better . Winters always did well in roles testing her nerves . The ending is of the macabre and who can forget Winters at the piano banging away with that totally insane look ?  
  What a terrible , TERRIBLE , film ! One of the worst movies I have seen in my life . I usually love movies like this , the whole " A guy meets an eccentric woman who he likes , but he happens to already be involved with someone , who not right for him .. " . I expected something predictable and I didn't mind . The movies are always entertaining mixing the right amount of romance with comedy , but not this one ! Every single joke falls flat and the " romance " makes me want to vomit . The title character is one of the most " please kill me " characters that I have ever witnessed on my television , the " eccentric woman " isn't very eccentric , more like quirky and annoying . The " other someone " is the most reasonable , mature person in this film but also happens to be just as annoying . This films flat out sucks , there 's no way around it , don't waste your time .  
  This film was so predictable , that during the entire time you 're hoping that the obvious suspect is innocent , and there 's some other big twist still coming . However .. it doesn't . He just continues to act creepy , and she continues to ignore it . Mary found very incriminating evidence at his place , and she still trusted him ? And what was that " baiting the trap " ? There was no trap . She confronted him , he said " excuse me . I have to go kill someone " He left , and that was the end of it . They make attempts to use other suspects , ( like that one older carnival girl at the end ) but they 're completely underdeveloped . Actually , all the characters are underdeveloped . They have no depth , and the setting is just plain strange .. who hangs out in a recycling factory ? Its choppy and nothing is well developed . For example : When she leaves his place after having the beer , and he finds the pics and she runs out and he catches her and they end up having sex in that car .. what was that ? Her reactions weren't portrayed . In the car she acted scared like it could have been practically rape - but then all we see is her showering the next morning . boo It could have been so much better .. soo much better .  
  I have always wanted to see this because I love cheesy horror movies and with a title like this , I was sure " The Incredible Melting Man " would be a lot of fun . It really wasn't . I mean , the acting was entertainingly bad , the script contained some classic bad lines and the special effects looked like someone had sneezed all over the lead actor , so I should have loved it . Unfortunately it 's really draggy between these highlights . I decided to watch the last half of the movie while doing my tax return . That 's how boring this film is . Nevertheless , if you love bad movies you will enjoy the dramatic exit of the Fat Nurse , and the stellar acting of the guy who plays Dr . Ted . To be fair to the poor man , he does have to deliver some amazingly inept lines with straight face - like the conversation he has with his wife on tracking down the I M Man : " I 'll find him with a geiger counter . " " Is he radioactive ? " " Just a little bit . " Yes , the plot has Dr . Ted wandering about trying to find a superstrong zombie killing machine armed only with what looks like a mini-Dyson . He 's a brave man . Unfortunately his plan fails when he finds a big lot of goop on a tree . " Oh god - it 's his ear ! " says Dr . Ted to the audience . I 'm so glad he cleared that up . I realise I 'm making this movie sound rather fun . It would be if it were only 10 minutes long , but unfortunately it goes on and on , and the Incredible Melting Dude just dangles about making a sticky mess when he should be eating more people in my opinion . I think if you were truly stoned you would probably love it , just don't have pop-tarts during the movie , because the lead actor really does resemble one near the end .  
  " The house of the spirits " is quite awful . I live in South America , in a country that suffered a military dictatorship just like the one the movie tries to describe , and even though everyone knows movies may be far far away from reality , this particular movie treats viewers as both ignorant and stupid . Things are not so simple and linear as appears here , and of course political process are much more complicated and interesting that the plot in " The house .. " . If you can't show that complexity on screen is better not making a movie at all . There are a lot of examples of how can politics be seriously taken in cinema , without so many commonplaces . In some parts I felt that Carmen Miranda may appear within parrots and palm trees . When you talk about certain things you must be not only careful but respectful to your public 's intelligence .  
  Return of the Boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn't play like a movie , it plays like an episode of a TV sitcom when they flashback to older episodes . Return of the Boogyman is just a clip show . Mutch of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie . Over and over again the same footage . How boring this is . The movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie . I have seen the first movie I don't want to see the same scenes over and over again and I don't know who would . The whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and thats it .  
  Acting was weak , but in a horror flick , I can live with that if the story is good . It wasn't . The initial event was an clumsy and obvious ploy to exploit most people 's adoration of kids . OK , fine . Fast forward to the " place in the country " where they will recover emotionally . I like the revelation of the ghosts . OK , cool-this will be a supernatural kinda horror story , with rotting things partly in our world partly in .. where ever . Then the action starts pulling like a three headed dog in a flurry of cats and birds-Is there an evil force trying to attack them directly ? Is there an evil force trying to attack them INdirectly-make people do awful things they wouldn't really do ? Oh , wait , no , maybe the whole REGION is some kind of psychic echo chamber where ambient discord can reverberate into murder ? OK , hold on-maybe it 's really just one little mentally tangled " Delbert " - style redneck boy who misses his Mommy and is on some kind of spree like a K-Tel Norman Bates knock off ? Oh , yeah-extra points off : the only Black character seems to be the grandson of an " Our Gang " pullman porter . The actor plays it as straight as he can given the crummy dialogue , but the fact is , his purpose is " Y'all done betta get outa heah , Boss ! " At least they wrote him smart enough to GTF outta there . The bit with the little girl being silenced and pulled away was definitely creepy , as was the chick in the shower . Those were just two of quite a few really delicious tidbits in this movie . The problem is that they are combined in disharmonious ways , like a bite of steak , a bite of chocolate and a bite of a Gummi bear . Each is great on it 's own , but mixed up ? Bleah ! Such potential . Wasted .  
  I 'm not sure why Spike Lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor Stevie Wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess . I also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional Blacks . The abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame . Scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes , play as if some college kid wrote this . I especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up Snipes . The overacting of the leads makes one feel as if Spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about . The final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in . This movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the F-word in casual conversation . I am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker . I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move . He should stick to making documentaries like the Four Little Colored Girls . Shock movies do not an Oscar make .  
  This film is too skeletal . It 's a fairly low-budget film ( I hope ! ) which excuses it somewhat , but the lack of a decent cast and a fleshed out plot hurts it too much . Phillips is quite believable in his role as a torn-apart son of a well-off family who 's searching for himself ( though his family is .. er .. well , a little too white .. ) , but the rest of the cast is grasping at straws . Every moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama , and there are * way * too many sub-plots ( which is an obvious sign of plot-deficiency . They needed filler .. ) I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who isn't either a hard-core Phillips fan , or who has absolutely * nothing * to do . 4/10 .  
  This film is beautiful to look at , but is like watching really bad experimental theater . The plot ( if there was one ) doesn't make any sense . But it is very " artistic " . Lots of shots of half-dressed actors wrestling and looking deep into each other 's eyes . Lots of arty shots through windows and with people out of frame . Mumbling and people wandering wistfully . Lingering close-ups of faces and bodies . By the time you get to the threesome on the roof with the cat , you 'll be ready to throw a bottle of KY at the screen . It is supposed to be about a father and son 's relationship , but you will just be wishing the two of them would just f * $ & each other and get it over with . If you have always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without any money shots , your wish has been granted .  
  Warning : This review contains a spoiler . Wow . Almost impressively bad . Note I said , " almost " . This is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story . The protagonists ( you CANNOT call them " heroes " ) shoot innocent bystanders for their food , and also rob same for similar reasons . There 's also tons of homoeroticism , which was a turnoff for me . ( SPOILER : It seems as if the villainess ( who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim ) gets killed early on , but miraculously recovers , adding another 70 minutes of audience-torture . ) I can't shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination . If you 're in a MST3K mood , you might find this watchable , but for the most part you can forget it . Go rent the original Conan DVD instead .  
  I don't normally feel much of an incentive to comment on films I don't like , but in a case like this one , I just have to say something . This movie is terrible , illogical , and stupid . There are so many flaws in the storytelling that I don't even feel obliged to elaborate on because it 's time for me to move on from this experience . The most annoying point is , however , that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for Bacon 's character 's madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his condition . Granted the special effects are impressive , and in the past Paul Verhoeven has done some good stuff ( the director 's cut of Robocop on DVD is great ) . However , this movie is stupid and generally doesn't come near to explaining the point or technical aspect of the subject matter , and instead settles for predictable action without any enjoyment . In short , as many other reviews here say ( wish I had read them before .. ) - Stay away from this film !  
  Holy crap ! What a terrible , terrible Spanish thriller ! I 've had it for about four years and finally started it the other night . I watched an hour or so before heading to bed . I was pretty intrigued by the whole thing . I finished it last night and couldn't believe where I stopped it the night before . Literally , I stopped it the second before the movie went completely downhill . Like I said , I was pretty intrigued and curious as to where this mystery was going but stopped it right when Simon receives the package in the bar . I picked up when he opens up the package to reveal a laser gun and then plays a " menacing " game of laser tag . Whew ! Then the big reveal is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot by role playing game nerds . WHEW ! You can tell the Spanish industry was definitely behind director Mateo Gil ( co-writer of Amenabar 's two big previous hits ) . There is an excellent score and great photography . But this scenario reeks of silliness . How anyone sat through the last 40 minutes with a straight face is beyond me .  
  This film was so bad i had to fast forward most of it to get to the good bits . Hah what good bits ? the only bit that was worth it was the ending ( those who have seen the film will know what i mean ) . I expected a lot from this film like a underworld meets dawn of the dead meets Freddy vs . Jason but what i got was this crap . Story was forgettable , the cast was used badly and what was the director thinking when he made this . This could have been a great but i turned out to be the most boring film i have ever watched . OK so what if there was a nice bit of T and A , I was after the gore and i was bitterly disappointed . Don't expect a film thats good but if you want a bad cheesy horror then by all means watch this and see how a horror movie SHOULDN'T BE DONE .  
  Dear me . Where do I start ? The dad isn't anywhere near old enough to be the girl 's dad . He corpses on camera in the first 5 minutes of the film . The favoured exclamation in this film is " Jesus Christ ! " . Zombies are agile , stupid and few and far between . Motives are utterly incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist . People ' rush ' to their destination in jeeps driven at 3 MPH . The world seems to be carrying on as normal yet these are supposed to be the end days . Breasts appear for the sake of breasts . Normally such an approach would provide some redemption but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in breasts or the future of humanity . There 's a dog for no reason and thin , orange blood that turns the stomach . The General and his catchphrase of " Shut the f * k up ! " is the only redeeming feature . As for the rest , I sincerely hope to hear that they had done the decent thing and killed themselves .  
  Well , this movie started out funny but quickly deteriorated . I thought it would be more ' adult oriented ' humor based on the first few moments but then the movie switched into a bad made-for-Disney Channel type mode , especially a go-kart racing scene that was incredibly long . Alana De La Garza is gorgeous but has a really fake Italian accent . The movie looked and sounded very independent and low budget . There was one very cute moment which I 'll just call the serenading scene but overall this one was a yawner . The laughs are very few and far between . The end surprise for " Mr . Fix It " is so ridiculous it left me more mad than anything else . Might be worth a look if you can catch it for free or TV but don't waste your money buying or renting this movie .  
  I gave it a 2 just because Natassia Malthe ( as the vampiress Quintana ) looks soo sexy in this movie . Certainly there is very little logic to this movie , but so are most of the sci-fi vampire flicks . The movie probably tried too much to break away from the traditional vampire stories . Unfortunately , it went too far and made the whole story not just unreasonable , but ridiculous . There is too much gore and too many rip off the body scenes that made me feel sick . A good vampire movie should be more sensible that you don't need to see a lot of blood - we all know when a vampire jumps on a human he / she is going to do what a vampire will do . A few moans or screams are all it needs to describe the scene ( like the one at end when Quintana tries to sexually arouse Rosa , all it needs is a few moans , the rest is your imagination ) . Anyway , it 's just my personal taste .  
  I think Micheal Ironsides acting career must be over , if he has to star in this sort of low budge crap . Surely he could do better than waste his time in this rubbish . This movie could be far better , if it had a good budget , but it shows repeatedly through-out the movie . There is one scene at a outpost , which looks like , its outside the front of a railway station , and i bet it was . There is one scene which made give this movie a 3 , and it shows the space craft landing and taking off over a lake , surrounded by forests . This was well done , but the rest of the movie , forget it . There is another scene , which looks like a engineering plant , which i bet it , and does not look like a space outpost as the character say it is . This movie is stupid , has a serious low budget , makes no sense and God Help Micheal Ironsides .  
  My commentary has nothing to do with the political sentiments found in the film . In fact , they 're quite congruent with mine . What gets me is the fact that in terms of a movie , it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of story , motive or dialogue . Maybe someone should tell Neal that substituting lyrics of songs which are failing to inspire anyone outside of a dwindling audience isn't the same thing as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director . A silly narrative remains as such despite the iconic legacy of Neal Young . The most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar , slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero , who then finds his way onto the dance floor to mouth the words to Young song to the heroine , who is unaware of what 's taken place . Somehow these two dream up a scheme where they will go up the West Coast in search of ? Sorry Neal , stick with music and leave film making to Steven Stills .  
  I saw this movie a few months ago in the town which appeared as Greendale in the movie , which is the only reason I went to see it . Another local who was there just forwarded to me an email announcement of a repeat showing because the first had sold out and people were turned away . His editorial comment in his forward is a good summary : " Yuk . " Unless you 're a Neil Young fan or live in / near " Greendale " ( if the latter you know the real name ) , skip this movie . It 's mostly an ego trip for the filmmaker . It has no discernible plot , the music is merely OK , and too much of the lyrics are unintelligible making it impossible to follow what little shreds of plot there may be . I don't need to put in a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away . I 'd give this a 1.5/10 , but that 's just for the amusement value of seeing the locales made into a movie . It wasn't worth the $ 6 . I could rent a video camera and drive around " Greendale " and make a better movie myself . If you want to see a * good * environmental-message movie with no plot , go rent Koyaanisqatsi .  
  " I 'm a cartoon ! " " You 're an illustration ! " what does that suppose to mean ? ! This plot could not be worse as a boy , who 's afraid of everything , becomes very brave at the very end of the film because he went into a library . The only purpose of this waste of celluloid was to encourage American kids to read , when a cheaper , and more effective way of doing this could have been a series of adverts ! Even the talents of Macaulay Culkin ( as the kid ) , Christopher Lloyd ( as the so predictable " that he 's a the Page Master " librarian ) , could save this pointless film from the dull plot . Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg , Patrick Stewart , ( even ) Leonard Nimoy , or the Hollywood God of voices , Frank Welker as the cartoon characters don't save it ever . I can only describe it as a 1990s equivalent to the even ghastly 1978 adaption of the Water Babies , because the bland animation makes the film worse , not improving the dull plot !  
  Having just wasted a couple of hours watching this and for 80 % of that time in complete disbelief , I can give this garbage the turkey of the year award , no problem . To say the plot was unbelievable is some big understatement . Frankly I am lost for words to describe this utter tripe . Not only are the characters completely and utterly without any semblance of originality ( this sort of stuff has been done much better in dozens of ' serial killer flicks ' ) but the acting was dire . For those who pay to see this , I hope you get your money back , for those who were paid to do this , I hope you GIVE your money back . Believe me folks there are many new releases out there that are much , much better . Go see .  
  This movie is another Christian propaganda film in the line of The Omega Code . Not that that is necessarily bad but for the fact that most propaganda films sacrifice sincerity and realism for the message they wish to deliver . If you enjoy a styrofoam portrayal of life on the streets and the way the Gospel can change a life , than perhaps you may enjoy this movie . I say , save your money and rent The Cross and The Switchblade or The Mission . When will Christian directors learn that sometimes people say bad words ? It was frustrating to see criminals depicted who are not allowed to swear ( huh ? criminals say bad words ? ) and flat characters I really could not relate to . Also , it would 've been great if the movie had shown some T & A . Now that would be something I 'd like to pay to see . Who was the blockhead who compared this communion wafer-thin story of a movie with The Boondock Saints and The Sting ?  
  I can't understand why so many peoples praised this show . Twin peaks is one of the most boring titles I have ever seen in my life . Now I have seen all season 1 episodes , and seeing season 2 episode 1 . Simply I can't take this show anymore . 1 ) Where is the proper induction in criminal investigation ? In season 1 , there was a scene that agent Cooper throws stones to a bottle . Can you guess why he did that ? He just want to identify murderer by doing this ' joke ' while mentioning supernatural ability given by Tibet dream . Wow ! 2 ) There are too many unnecessary scenes in this show . For example , season 2 started with a ' funny ' scene that a dumb old man serves agent Cooper with a cup of milk while Cooper are laying down on the floor . ( He got the gun shoots in his belly already . ) This old man is doing nothing but saying some dumb comments . That 's all . This scene is really boring and even long ( 3 min 30 sec .. It 's like Hell . ) I would read some comic books rather than see this show anymore .  
  I gave Timecop a perfect 10 , I gave this 1 It 's story is very boring , and it has only little to do with the original Timecop . Lots of things from Timecop was scrapped , and they put in new stupid stuff instead . This story is taking place in 2060 ( if I remember correctly ) , but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous : confused : And the action scenes are nothing to be happy about , well most of them aren't .. only the first one is great .. and there aren't many action scenes at all , and they 're all pretty short At one point in the story , the main character travels through time about 5 times within a few minutes .. no wait , make that two times .. In short : Don't waste time watching this movie , it 's not worth it  
  Previous comment made me write this . It says that Muslims are blonde and Serbs are dark ( because our blood is mixed ) . This comment just says that this opinion can be made by racist . Look , race is nothing . I 'm color blind . I look like Pierce Brosnan but I 'm no Irish . So what ? I might add that I am not 100 % Serb , that I have some Austrian and Croat blood within me but whats the point . I 'm dark , half-breed ? Is that so ? Anyone using racial prejudices with such bad intent like Lantos ( producer9and director is racist for me . Karadzhic , Izetbegovich , Milosevic , Tudjman they are all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life , my family , my country , Yuggoslavia . Hope they will be all in hell but that wont return our dead relatives back . I am proud of being Serb and I am proud of my cousins , Austrians , Croats , Muslims , Hungarians , Arabs ( yes I am from Serbia and I have multiethnical family ) . This movie doesn't show sufferings of Serbs or Croats within Sarayevo , terrible terrorism of street gangs , Muslim extremism . I add : I kneel and pray for all innocent sisters and brothers Muslim , catholic or orthodox , killed in this war . This film is manipulation with our misery , false humanitarianism 's which doesn't help at all . It helps Lantos to fill his pockets with more doe , alright !  
  I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons : 1 ) Host Steve Martin was at his most wittiest : " I saw the teamsters help Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo " and " I 'll better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodle 's head in my bed " 2 ) Surprise winners : No one had Adrien Brody down for best actor ( Genuine applause ) or Roman Polanski for best director ( Genuine jeers and boos ) but they won Last year 's award ceremony wasn't too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING sweep the awards even if it wasn't the best in the trilogy ( FELLOWSHIP was much better ) but what let the BBC coverage down was Jonathan Ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but . So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links , but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne ! Oh gawd if British TV are desperate for film critics ( Obviously they are ) I 'm sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers Chris Rock wasn't too bad , but he 's no Steve Martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in ! Not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the " minor " Oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats ! There 's no such thing as a " minor " Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design they 're as well deserved as Best Picture or Best Director . All the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium . What a bunch of arrogant snobs the Academy are becoming and I quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn't for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . As for the awards themselves Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett . No great surprise for a competitive category Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman . No real complaints since Freeman is one of America 's greatest living character actors Best Actor - Jamie Foxx . Most predictable award of the night . Yawn Best Actress - Hilary Swank . Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night Best Director - Clint Eastwood . Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because he 'd never won one . Actually I 'm glad about this because if he didn't deserve it for TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he didn't deserve it for THE AVIATOR Best Film - MILLION DOLLAR BABY . Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDB 's controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven't done in the past , I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawd 's sake ! And long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts  
  First of all , let me say that this is not the movie for people looking to watch something spirited and joyous for the holidays . This movie is cold , brutal , and just downright depressing . Mary Steenburgen plays a grinchy mom who is down on Christmas because her husband has lost his job , they are losing their house , can't buy Christmas presents for the kids , etc . You get the idea , happy stuff for the holidays . So along comes Harry Dean Stanton as Gideon the Christmas angel , who in his dark hat and long overcoat comes off more like a pedophile who hangs around children all day observing them . What better way to instill the spirit of Christmas in Mary Steenburgen than to kill off her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in Christmas again . Santa Claus is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop looks more like a haven for refugee Nazis on the lam . The movie lays everything on so thick that you don't care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable . I 'm sure this film wanted to be something Capra-like , but it left out the joy and sentiment on what a holiday film should be .  
  * SPOILERS * * SPOILERS * Juggernaut is a British made " thriller " released in the US by First National . Karloff is Dr . Sartorius who has to leave his research because his funds have dried up . Karloff is forced to retreat to France and start up a medical practice . He is propositioned by a conniving woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband . She knows Karloff needs the money . Karloff agrees to the proposition and soon becomes the personal doctor of the husband . All the while , the wife is prancing about town with the local no good playboy . Karloff finally injects the old geyser with poison and he kicks off . However , his son ( from another marriage ) arrives a few days before the killing and finds out the will has been changed . When he spills the beans to the wife , she goes berserk and even bites the son 's hand . Meanwhile , Karloff 's nurse has misplaced the hypo Karloff used to kill the old man . When Karloff finds out he isn't getting any money , he asks the wife to poison the son . The nurse suspects Karloff and finds the missing hypo . Analysis shows poison , but not quite in time as Karloff kidnaps the nurse . To make a long story short , the nurse escapes , gets the police , and manages to save the son who is about to be injected by Karloff . Karloff instead injects himself and dies . This movie does have some good points . Karloff is possessed and plays the type of mad doctor he did in The Devil Commands and the Man Who Lived Again . It is peculiar , however , to see him walk around stiffly and slightly hunched over . We never find out why he is walking this way . I suspect the director thought it made him more sinister . The actress playing the 2-timing wife overacts something terrible . She has a French accent . Even though she overacts badly , you still manage to hate her ( or maybe you hate her because of her acting .. ) . A little below average for a Karloff vehicle . If you buy the Sinister Cinema VHS copy , the audio is a bit choppy .  
  This video nasty was initially banned in Britain , and allowed in last November without cuts . It features the Playboy Playmate of the Month October 1979 , Ursula Buchfellner . The opening cuts back and forth between Buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures . I am not sure what the purpose of that was . It would have been much better to focus on the bathtub scene . Laura ( Buchfellner ) is kidnapped and held in the jungle for ransom . Peter ( Al Cliver - The Beyond , Zombie ) is sent to find her and the ransom . Of course , one of the kidnappers ( Antonio de Cabo ) manages to pass the time productively , while another ( Werner Pochath ) whines incessantly . The ransom exchange goes to hell , and Laura runs into the jungle . Will Peter save her before the cannibals have a meal ? Oh , yes , there are cannibals in this jungle . Why do you think it was a video nasty ! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his partner ( Antonio Mayans - Angel of Death ) on the kidnapper 's boat . Montossé is very comfortably undressed . Peter leaves them and goes off alone to find Laura , who has been captured by now . They pass the time having sex , and don't see the danger approaching . Guts , anyone ? Great fight between Peter and the naked devil ( Burt Altman ) . Blood , decapitation , guts , lots of full frontal , some great writhing by the cannibal priestess ( Aline Mess ) , and the line , " They tore her heart out , " which is hilarious if you see the film .  
  I watched this movie just a little while ago and I found that this movie was terrible ! It moved very slowly and was hardly entertaining ! Sorry for all those that liked it .. this is only my opinion !  
  This movie was probably about as silly as The Naked Gun ( which was supposed to be ) . Case in point : 1 . In order to fake her drowning Roberts is secretly taking swimming lessons at the YWCA . After her " death " the YWCA calls her husband at work to give their condolences . HELLO how did they get his work number ? 2 . Before she leaves town she drops her wedding ring in the toilet . Days or even weeks later her hubby finds it in the John . Does this mean the toilet was never flushed ? 3 . No explanation is given on how she is paying for her mothers care in the retirement home ( since she did it behind her RICH husbands back ) . 4 . Towards the end of this tiresome film Roberts suspects her husband is in the house . Instead of running for her life she runs to the kitchen instead to see if the cans are stacked neatly .  
  I wasn't expecting much of this film - a fun little diversion . Wuthering Heights could be turned into a plausible modern story - nice and soapy , melodramatic and intriguing . But this film decided to throw away the talents of the people involved in a simpering version so watered down from the source material that it 's amazing they had the guts to call it Wuthering Heights at all . It ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are in essence unlikeable , mostly unsympathetic , and frequently cruel to one another . It changes the very nature of certain characters - Isabelle , for instance , in the novel , had not a conniving bone in her body - they 've stripped her blind idealism and turned her into a scheming whore . Heathcliff is an awful person who psychologically tortures most people in his path , but in this version Catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care . The dialog is trite and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver any of it with straight faces . In place of depth or actual emotions , we know they mean something when they scream it in someone 's face . I 've read criticism of the early 90 's version , " Emily Bronte 's Wuthering Heights " which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche , saying that it turned an intensely dark , Gothic story into a sudsy bodice-ripper . Slightly valid comments , but the MTV version goes a step further , using the basic story structure to deliver chipper beach bums cavorting to really bad music .  
  ` The Matrix ' was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its ` Twilight Zone'-ish manner . The general rule applies here - and this sequel doesn't match up to its predecessor . Worse than that , it doesn't even compare with it . ` Reloaded ' explodes onto the screen in the most un-professional fashion . In the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as Trinity is shot in a dream . Immediately after that , the film nose-dives . After a disastrous first 45 minutes , it gradually gains momentum when they enter the Matrix and the Agent Smith battle takes place . But it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14-minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan-worthy twist at the end . Worst of all is the overlong ` Zion Rave ' scene . Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot , but it 's also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music . The bullet-time aspect of ` The Matrix ' was a good addition , but in ` ' Reloaded ' they overuse to make it seem boring . In the first one there were interesting plot turns , but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting . The movie is basically , just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is . It works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better . It appears that ` The Matrix ' franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the ` Star Wars ' saga have . The acting standard is poor for the most part . The best character of course goes to Hugo Weaving 's ` Agent Smith '- the only one to be slightly interesting . Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo , but in all the special effects , there is little room to make much of an impact . Academy Award Nominee Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue . Carrie Ann Moss ' part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress . A poor , thrown-together movie , ` The Matrix Reloaded ' is a disappointment . Those who didn't like the first one are unlikely to flock to it . This one 's for die-hard fans only . Even in the movie 's own sub-genre of special effect bonanzas ( Minority Report , The Matrix etc . ) this is still rather poor . My IMDb rating : 4.5/10 .  
  Not sure if I 'm referring to those who labeled this a video nasty or to the director .. " Devil Hunter " sure is one bizarre ' horror ' movie . The plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior films like " Cannibal Ferox " and " Cut and Run . " Chick gets kidnapped in the ' jungle ' by a ' tribe ' of ' savages . ' The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico . The tribe is like a group of hippies who walk around in Party City-style Halloween costume renditions of tribal garb . And the savages range in race from white to Asian to black to hispanic . I suppose Franco just grabbed anyone who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp . To make matters worse , this film has ultra-minimal gore , no real scares and a lot of unnecessary penis . Not fun . I can find something to like in just about any sleazy Italian or Euro-trash film ; this one just fell WAY short . 2 out of 10 , kids .  
  I actually went to see this film in a theater , but what a complete waste of time and money ! Bad acting , I 'm sorry to say , did not help to enjoy this rather sticky screenplay . Some friends told me to go and see this film , since James Redfield , the author of the book , was very heavily involved in the screenplay . They had really enjoyed the book , so the movie just had to be perfect . Well maybe I had my hopes up a bit too high , but I absolutely hated this movie ! It was predictable , too sweetish to a point that I actually left I had to vomit and worst of all there is going to be a sequel ! Do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade .  
  This movie is just not worth your time . Its reliance upon New-Age mysticism serves as its only semi-interesting distraction . The plot is one that has been re-cycled countless times . I was only prompted to even spend the time to put in a comment when I noted that some have tried to prop-up the reputation of this drivel . Their motivation & objectivity is dubious , since they encourage you not to look at the movies faults , but at its well intentioned message of New Age consciousness . So would it be alright for some twenty to thirty Evangelical Christians , or Islamic Fundamentalists to pour in positive ratings about movies / television that support their views ? In spite of the poor qualities of production , or the lack of truth in any of its supposed historic basis ? I hope not . I am sure the followers will come right behind me to say flowery things about this movie , in spite of the truth .  
  Sure , I like short cartoons , but I didn't like this one . Naturally , kids would love it . But then again , I 'm not a kid anymore ( although I still consider myself young ) . I will not tell you anything about the story , for the simple reason there is no story . How is it possible this dragon of a cartoon was nominated for an Oscar ? ! Well .. I guess it 's because people in the 30 's were more happy with not much than now . In the present where we live , everything must happen fast . Look at the movies nowadays , and you will come to the same conclusion : we live in a society that doesn't allow men to be slow . That 's really a shame . I wish I lived in the 30 's , because it seems so peaceful . But every time has got its ups and downs , I guess .. To conclude : if you like music ( and frogs ) , you 'll have to see this cartoon . Otherwise , don't spill your time on it .  
  I watched this film because I noticed that it had Kari Wuhrer in the cast . I have long had a theory about her , that she is a talented actress , but never seems to get to prove that , because she is always in this sort of low-budget B movie . She is still beautiful , and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material I always see her in . This is no different . The film is often ugly and disturbing , but that doesn't make it good . George Wendt played against type , and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role . Another note about Ms . Wuhrer . Her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since I saw her last . Perhaps reduction surgery , or ( more likely ) removal of implants . This NOT a bad thing . She still looks great . I would like to see her in a better movie .  
  This movie is not in anyway funny , it tries to be funny with it 's lame humor , which is so dry and boring that the movie is just 2 hours of torture . Throughout the whole movie i was thinking one thing , " when is this gonna end " . One thing you have to hand to them , is that they do have a very few mildly funny moments , which is also why i gave it a whole 2 stars . It is unoriginal and uses up almost every old blonde joke in the book , even the ones that wasn't funny the first time . It basically is a movie to belittle blondes and to record the whole repetoir of blonde jokes . To sum it all up , this movie is blonde humor gone bad , it is not worth paying any amount of money to watch , it is just that bad .  
  I hate this movie . I hate the show . i hate just about everything about it . it 's so annoying and stupid . everyone 's saying that nat and alex wolff are heroes in the music world and that they 're going to make it big . WHAT KIND OF DRUGS ARE YOU TAKING ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! nat and alex are going to end up as either hobos or end up like Jane Hudson from " Whatever Happened to Baby Jane ? " . i could only get through not even 20 minutes of this one , barely 30 seconds of the show , and i managed to survive about half an hour of ' Battle of the Bands ' . How anyone could cheer for these guys in the audience at the Kid 's Choice Awards , i have no clue . days before the movie premiere on Nick , most of the teen girl actresses on Nick ( Jamie Spears , Emma Roberts , Lindsey Shaw , etc . ) showed up in a commercial influencing brain-dead kids about how awesome nat and alex wolff are . first off , they didn ; t trick me , and second of all , nat and alex probably either drugged them or payed them loads of money in order to say that and sound convincing , because i don't see how anyone could find this show / movie entertaining . the music is just awful . nat 's singing sounds like a sick , dying moose on crack . alex is the most annoying movie / TV show character EVER . he 's not funny , he 's annoying , he 's really weird , and he thinks he 's hot and knows everything about girls . this guy 's lucky if he ever manages to get laid . you know this show is fake when you find out that some of the characters ( in real life ) don't even exist ! the character Jesse is actually played by Nat and Alex 's cousin jesse Draper ( they mustve had some budget problem ) . Their father is not single , he 's married to Polly Draper , but she doesn't appear on the show , making it seem the Wolff 's are mom-less . Rosalina doesn't exist either . Her name is Allie DiMeco . I 'll tell ya , the Naked Brothers are gonna be in some deep sh * when their " fans " find out the whole thing is staged . 0/10  
  LIVE A LITTLE , LOVE A LITTLE is one of Elvis ' weirdest movies . Part slapstick , part fluff , part surreal and part strange . Elvis meets up with a very off-beat girl with an annoying voice . She looks like Jennifer Aniston . Story doesn't make much sense as is the case with most Elvis Presley movies , and there a bunch of odd characters galore . Not much music in this one , but what there is I liked , although none are memorable . Strange continuity . Elvis and Michelle Carey go into her beach house at night , but a few minutes later a delivery boy comes in and it 's stark daylight ! What ? That 's about the essence of the movie . What ? Oh , two good things about the movie : A ) Elvis looks great and B ) the dog steals the show .  
  If I write a review about a movie , maybe it will stick with me .. but generally I expect that I will have forgotten I 've seen this one a mere two weeks from now . So why bother ? Because again I find myself watching a low-rated movie that was fun to watch . I didn't expect I 'd to be able to stay in the room while it was on . It wasn't great , but at least it was not unbearable .. not a comedy of errors which always makes me cringe . It was just sweet fluff .. and if you can't take it , stay in the locker room boys . I agree with those who defend this movie because it is sure to please its targeted demographic , and won't be a total bore to an adult . It offers a few good chuckles here and there , but nary a side splitter . Sure it is silly and only mildly entertaining , but at least it doesn't suck ( as so many have said it does ) . Maybe those folks are afraid of their sensitive sides ? I have a tendency to grade on the bell curve , so a 4,5 or 6 is actually an okay all-around rating in my book . Giving it a 4 makes sense and will bolster its rating at the time of this writing . Giving it a 1 or a 10 , as most have done thus far , makes the rating numbers meaningless . I cannot believe how strongly people feel one way or the other about this forgettable fluff ( or that I am even bothering to write about it ) . Am I missing something ? Anyway , it should be noted that Emma Roberts performs her role as Clairedycat quite convincingly . Ariell Kebbel often written into b * ch roles does not disappoint when her character gets her due . You might also recognize Bruce Spence playing Leonard , though his role is ancillary . Surely you can miss this one if you are an adult . But , if there is a pre-teen girl in your life , rent this movie for her .. and be prepared NOT to hate it ( you might even enjoy it ) .  
  I am so insulted by this movie , it 's not even funny .. And I thought " Mulan " was unbelievable ! However low my expectations of Disney have become , I never figured they 'd do something so stereotypical yet so off . There is no respect here for any true Chinese culture , just the Hollywood tradition of random martial arts . I appreciate that they tried to make Wendy into a normal teenage girl .. But , fortunately , most normal teenage girls-particularly Asian teenage girls-are much less obsessed with such shallow aspects of life . And from a cultural stand point , it 's almost impossible . Yes , there are girls who are wrapped up in popularity and fashion , but they 're pretty rare . And even the ones who are are still fairly decent scholars . Another stereotype , maybe , but a fairly true one . Because that 's how Chinese parents work . That 's how Chinese values work . If they wanted to go for authenticity , they would 've made Wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love-hate relationship with her family . This just adds to my frustration with American movies . Asian culture isn't about meditation and vague , nature-oriented phrases that sound wise . We don't walk around smiling enigmatically all the time , and we don't all know some form of martial arts . We 're a PEOPLE , and I 'd appreciate it if someone would write an Asian part that doesn't portray us as some sad caricature .  
  I thought this movie was terrible . I 'm Chinese , so I thought everything was totally wrong . Many of the facts were incorrect . The only thing right about Chinese history in the movie was when Wendy 's mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi . I also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake . Many of the actors and actresses were not very great . Some of the jokes that were supposedly " funny " were really stupid . I think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get . Disney has really got to get more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie . Mulan was quite accurate . Watch this movie if you want to waste some time .  
  This movie was so poorly written and directed I fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie . The jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles , it is too far fetched and at some points - ridiculous . If you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed , but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts ( which I might add are poorly done ) and wish you were some warrior to . The casting in this movie wasn't very good , and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it didn't fit at all . On a scale of 1-10 ( 10 being excellent , 1 being horrible ) the acting in this movie is a 4 . Brenda Song is talented in comedy , but with this kind of movie , in some of the more serious scenes , her acting was laughable . When she made some of her " fighting " poses , I started laughing out loud . I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing , for example , the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing , how her voice turns dark and evil , I think that was incredibly stupid , and how Wendy 's ( Brenda Song ) teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks , that was pretty ridiculous to . So to sumamrize it all , a disappointing movie , but okay if you 're 10 or under .  
  I saw this movie not knowing anything about it before hand . The plot was terrible with large gaps of information missing . The movie didn't have the " battle of wits " feel to me . The actors just spewed out mouthful 's of nonsense , at times causing me to gnash my teeth in agony as they droned on and on . The plot was predictable except for the stomach sickening homo erotic scene at the end ( I 'm not homophobic but made me physically sick to my stomach ) , even the ending was predictable . And you could tell the detective was Jude Law in a costume , everything from the fake accent , terrible dental work , costume shop facial hair , everything pointed to it being a disguise . The whole movie just felt like wasted time out of my life . This movie had the feel of a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine as puppets and the house as the window to view the show , really booring in my opinion .  
  I love John Saxon in anything he 's in . The one time he takes over the camera though he directs a movie that should have more aptly been been titled " Please Do Not Watch This Movie Called : Zombie Death House " . The $ 1000 dollar Shock Insurance Certificate is dear Fred Olen Ray 's tricky way of making you spend 14 dollars on a filmed dump churned out by a major 70 's cheese legend . Ray being the front man at RetroMedia . Ray by the way makes Charles Band look hotter than stucco ceilings on a Ford Falcon . Just plain bad now , the both of them - and boring besides . It 's great that Ray is digging up this old stuff and in some cases it 's public domain like the rest of the dollar video hucksters but in the case of Zombie Death House - ( the word " Zombie " sloppily superimposed to add ownership and interest on the part of F.O.R. ) THE ONLY WAY TO DO SERVICE TO THIS TRIPE IS TO RELEASE IT ON THE DOLLAR MARKET FOR THE CURIOUS COLLECTOR AND FANS OF SAXON ! If you wanna see real Saxon , pick up Black Christmas , Nightmare on Elm Street or The Glove .  
  It figures this is a French film , LOL , with the emphasis on young girls with much older men .. why is it the French are so fixated on this kind of thing ? When the age difference is this great , it really comes off as pervy ! Valentina Cervi is beautiful ( she bears a strong resemblance to Olivia Hussey , of Zeffirelli 's ' 68 Romeo and Juliet , set in a similar period ) , but she looks about 15 and the actor playing Tassi , her painting instructor , looks .. well , 50 is KIND . Other posters have done the work of explaining the historical record ( unusually detailed in this case ) of the real Artemisia , a great artist and one of the earliest recognized female painters of this period ( 17th century ) . Her story speaks to us in modern times particularly because of the age-old accusation that " all great artists were men " - she pretty much blasts that assertion to bits - and because the story of her rape trial is so poignant . Not only was she clearly assaulted , and forced into a degrading sexual relationship ( because in those days marriage to your assaulter was the only way to avoid social shame ) , but Tassi was a serial rapist and possibly killed his wife and child . The movie does a terrible disservice by inverting this truly fascinating and remarkable real life story - very dramatic and not in need of any " spicing up " - because in some weird Frencified way , it 's " hotter " to have an oversexed teenager drawing male sexual organs and having a hot love affair with a man old enough to be her grandfather . That 's " sexy " - the truth is boring and seems too feminist / politically correct . It also disturbs me that this is ONLY part of Artemisia life considered interesting enough to film . The fact that she painted for decades ( her famous painting of Judith beheading Holfernes was painted AFTER , not before the rape ) , that she was the first woman admitted to the prestigious Florentine Academy , that she went on to have children .. oh that 's boring stuff . After all , that 's about a middle aged woman and they aren't " hot " like teenagers . I understand that there is a lot of creative license in making a film ( or a book ) about a real historical character . You need to create dialog , have subplots , create dramatic structure . Certainly some details can be sacrificed - it 's no big deal if the dates are moved a few years , or if Artemisia is played by a blonde actress ( when we know from her self portraits that she was a brunette .. and a big boned one , not a skinny minny ) , or something like that . But to turn her story around on her , and make rape into a romance is actually sick and disturbing . It 's even worse because the director is female . She should be horribly ashamed of herself ! If you LIKE this ( and I know some people could care less about the real woman artist and just like period costumes and hot sex ) , you will probably like " Dangerous Beauty " with Rufus Sewell and Catherine McCormack . Similarly based on heavily re-written history , with lots of heaving bosoms and jewel encrusted goblets : Bon Appetit !  
  Why oh why don't blockbuster movies simply stick to their selling point ? Everyone in the cinema , young and old , was there to see talking animals make jokes , and whilst they did that we were all happy .. And then , as with Lost In Space , came the two killer blows - plot and sentiment . Who really cared what happened to the tiger or whether Eddie Murphy made up with his daughter ? Not me , that 's for sure .  
  I 'll start with what I liked . I really liked the songs , everything about them was great , the costumes , music , lyrics ( as long as the translation was good : ) ) , choreography , everything . I loved the crab scene and the cooking scene . But that 's about it . I get it , arty cinema , blablabla , but too much is too much . Too much silence ( it was interesting for an hour , but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time , really .. ) , too much boredom ( no movie should ever be boring , no matter how deep it was to be ! ) , too much porn-like scenes ( I do get it really , I get that they were filming a porn movie there , but really , REALLY , really that is too much ) I truly think , that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no way . 3 stars for the songs .  
  SPOILERS THROUGHOUT ! I had read the book " 1st to die " and wanted to see if the movie followed the book so I watched it . For the most part it did . There were some MINOR differences ( location of the last violent scene for instance ) but not many and for the most part the movie stayed true to the book more so then most movies . This may have been a mistake-although the movie was perfectly cast-with Pollen and Bellows especially-I was not that impressed with the book . Or let me take that back . I started off very impressed , gradually became more disillusioned and by the end was left completely unsatisfied and felt almost gypped . No difference with The movie . Here is why . There is no " payoff " in the book , or the movie . Rarely have I read a who done it thriller that has created such a letdown with it 's final resolution and I had hoped the movie would vary a little . The whole - ( he did it , NO she did it , NO they BOTH did it ) - was not interesting , not fascinating and more confusing , annoying and depressing then anything else . Add to that , that the love of Lindsay 's life dies at the end ( after HER disease cleares and she cries at his grave ) .. and then cut to where she 's contemplating suicide .. then all of a sudden she 's in a fight for her life with the REAL villain who was cleared after being arrested .. but it turns out he and the wife were in it together .. HELLO ! This whole thing has now become " GENERAL HOSPITAL " instead of a good old fashioned thriller . I felt cheated and ripped off by the book and watching the movie ( I must admit it held my attention nicely - the acting was very good for a TV movie ) was hoping it wouldn't follow the book which it wound up doing . I still think the movie is watchable and for some reason does not leave as bad a taste in your mouth as the book ( or maybe it 's just that I knew what would happen ) But I have to say the way this story unraveled was not well done at all .  
  That 's right , you heard me . I am a huge fan of James Patterson . I own 10 of his books , and I have read the entire series about Lindsey Boxer . In my opinion , the screenwriter should be shot . What right did any film maker have to slaughter a terrific work of fiction and make it into a mockery of the mystery genre ? If I ever thought that Harry Potter was butchered , then Michael O'Hara has proved me wrong . I can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book will do it a great deal more justice . To Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy : don't quit your day job .  
  I 've always been enthusiastic about period dramas , an art form in which the BBC has excelled in the past . This presentation of " Byron " was unbelievable . Unbelievably bad ! The script was dreadful , the acting uninspired , and all the characters woefully insipid . Apparently Byron was " mad bad and dangerous to know " , and set the ladies hearts all-a-flutter . Not in this production . Here he appeared as a tawdry jumped-up little squirt instead of a fiery hero of womenfolk and the Greek struggle for independence . It is said that Byron walked with a limp . This portrayal of the man was just limp all over . I watched the whole two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life . Not a splutter , not even a glimmer . It was utter tedium , if not downright boredom , from start to finish . Having the opinion that no-one will ever better the Bard of Avon , I also believe that Byron 's poetry is over-revered and to my mind should be flung on the back burner , and this dramatisation of his life should be accorded the same treatment . I think the BBC lost its nous with this one  
  This movie is a farce ! Names are grossly mispronounced and the plot is twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable by any literature enthusiast . And they have the gall to give Beowulf a ridiculous cannon / crossbow weapon . Beowulf doesn't need a weapon like that ! In the poem , he rips off Grendel 's arm with his bare hands ! And I can't believe that the scriptwriters did such a thing . The way Grendel is portrayed is impressive however . That and the cast are the only positive points of the feature . My English teacher would go insane if she saw this abomination . Unless you are a die-hard fan of the epic poem " Beowulf , " avoid this film at all costs . And even then , I wouldn't recommend it .  
  Imagine you 're a high-school boy , in the back of a dark , uncrowded theater with your girlfriend . How bad would a movie have to be , in order that you would feel compelled to leave the theater and head home before it ended ? This movie is that bad . Really . Movies often become so bad that they 're good ; this movie is beyond that stage of bad-ness . It is painfully bad . Horribly , terribly , crime-against-humanity bad .  
  I found it a real task to sit through this film . The sound track was not the best and some of the accents made it difficult to understand what was being said . There was little to move the plot along and often the action simply stopped and there was a prolonged period of conversations which seemed extraneous to the movie . These conversations switched between family groups and the observer was left to try and piece together what the common thread was that tied them together . It is rare that I rate a film this low and do so in this case as the entire viewing experience left me thinking " so what " and " why did I waste my time watching this . "  
  This is probably the worst excuse for television programming since , oh , I don't know , WHATS HAPPENING NOW ? NOTHING ever happened on this ridiculous " series " . Even though it 's mostly shot by Britney and Kevin themselves , you don't get any good details into their personal lives . It 's mostly just them making stupid , jokey small talk and acting like white trash . Look , I love Britney 's music as much as the next babe , but this show is just pure filler for a nation so addicted to Britney that they would watch her clip her toenails ( yes , that could be an actual episode ) . Thank God these two broke up , because they were PAINFULLY dull together . This show is TOXIC !  
  There is no reason to see this movie . A good plot idea is handled very badly . In the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense . The reason for the killings are not made clear . The acting is awful . Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director . He was excellent in In the Bedroom , but here he is terrible . Amber Benson from Buffy , has to change her character someday . Even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed . Even though the movie was 80 minutes , which is too short for a good movie ( but too long for this one ) , there are no deleted scenes in the DVD which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the characters . Don't spend the time on this one .  
  La Sanguisuga Conduce la Danza , or The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance as I believe is it 's common English title , is set on ' Ireland ' in ' 1902 ' where the mysterious Count Richard Marnack ( Giacomo Rossi-Stuart ) invites soon-to-be out of work theatre actress Evelyn ( Patrizia Webley as Patrizia De Rossi ) & three more of her fellow soon-to-be out of work actress friends Cora ( Krista Nell ) , Penny ( Lidia Olizzi ) & Rosalind ( Marzia Damon as Caterina Chiani ) to his castle situated on a small island just off the coast . At first Evelyn is reluctant but is persuaded when it is agreed stage hand Samuel ( Leo Valeriano ) goes along as well . Once there Count Marnack tells his guests that his Father & Grandfather both cut the heads off their cheating wives using a ceremonial knife & there 's a feeling of unease when it turns out that Evelyn looks EXACTLY the same as the current Count 's wife who ran away not too long ago .. Along with having to worry about weirdo servants it turns out that someone wants to use the knife themselves to chop a few heads off .. This Italian production was written & directed by Alfredo Rizzo & is total , complete & utter crap from start to finish . First things first lets start the criticism with the title The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance , lets examine that title because when I do I feel somewhat cheated that there aren't any Vampires or any form of bloodsucking whatsoever , no-one ' leads ' anything at anytime & there most certainly isn't any dance or dancing so don't expect any of these things . What you should expect though is a tedious , dull , boring pointless little ' giallo ' that takes over an hour before anyone is killed & any sort of murder mystery starts to take shape , the first hour of La Sanguisuga Conduce la Danza is as plot less & uninteresting as anything out there . The best way to imagine it is to think of the most boring soft-core porn film you 've ever seen , then cut most of the soft-core porn out & that just leaves bad actors , bad dubbing , bad dialogue , a tiny bit of soft-core sex & lesbianism & absolutely nothing else . Yep , it really is that bad . The mystery elements are crap , people do illogical things for no apparent reason & the overly complicated ' twist ' ending is as bad as the rest of it , The Sixth Sense ( 1999 ) this ain't ! Director Rozzi does an OK job & La Sanguisga Conduce la Danza actually has a nice look & feel to it despite it 's obvious low budget , I mean there are scenes where he shows a ' storm ' raging outside the castle however the stock footage used is in black & white ! So the film jumps from bright colour to black & white whenever it cuts to the storm & back to colour again ! There is one absolutely hilarious scene where a maid & her friend discuss her breasts & she lets her friend feel them who is then full of compliments , this scene is so funny & just so unnatural that it 's priceless & easily the films best moment even if a bad 70 's porno would be embarrassed by the dialogue ! There is minimal nudity & the sex / lesbian scenes are very tame . Forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any apart from a decapitated head . Technically the films pretty good , the period setting & production design are actually quite impressive although it 's not massive in scope it does the job effectively enough . The film has a nice sense of colour & the cinematography is fine . The film is dubbed so it 's hard to give an opinion on the original performances but the voice actors are terrible & the dialogue is even worse than usual . La Sanguisuga Conduce la Danza is a terrible film , it makes no sense , it has virtually no story for over an hour , it has possibly the most misleading title ever & is really dull & boring with a confused stupid ' twist ' ending . As far as Euro horror fans go there are plenty of much better films than this so please don't waste your time , as for anyone else this is definitely one to avoid . Trivia Note : the notorious ( & banned in the UK ) Nazi exploitation / horror film Horrifying Experiments of the S.S Last Days ( 1977 ) AKA SS Hell Camp & The Beast in Heat was directed by Luigi Batzella & he has a fairly substantial role as a police detective in La Sanguisuga Conduce la Danza .  
  Nobody , but nobody , could chew the scenery like the Divine One , Ruth Elizabeth Davis , and " Elizabeth and Essex " is a great example why . Although she overplays the part at times , watch her when she gawfs about Raliegh writing the lyrics to a song her ladies-in-waiting are about to play : in that one moment , she makes us understand how Elizabeth was able to rule and rule absolutely ! At other times , she is done in by the script 's sappiness . When Elizabeth has to be vulnerable , she comes off as weak and shrewish . This has the added effect of undermining her authority : when she blows her stack and threatens to dispense justice , it 's hard to take her seriously . Flynn exudes charm , making us see how Essex was able to worm his way into Elizabeth 's heart , but he is totally inept at conveying the complexity and sheer evil of the man . It also doesn't help that Essex is badly underwritten . Why is he this hothead who wants to overthrow his Queen - even as he swears fidelity to her - except only that he is more blue-blooded , thus , more " worthy " of rule ? And why does Raliegh betray Elizabeth by intercepting her and Essex 's letters ? He 's in no risk of falling out of favor , and we know where Essex ( and his head ) is headed . So why does he risk his own head by speeding up the inevitable ? What did Curtiz do with all the $ he was given ? He doesn't even bother to try to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on a sound stage . He should 've ended it with Elizabeth the first time alone at The Tower ; everything else that follows ( especially the final scene between her and Essex ) is unnecessary . The costumes are fantastic . And is it me , or does Bette look exactly like Susan Sarandon ?  
  Flame in , flame out . That seems to be Gammera in a nutshell , a prehistoric creature who can take it and dish it out with equal abandon . I 'm not a fan of Japanese monster films , but wound up committed to viewing all the flicks on the fifty film DVD sci-fi collection put out by Mill Creek / Treeline Films . It 's a great value at about twenty five bucks , so at fifty cents per movie , it really boils down to an investment in time to watch some of the goofy offerings . Gammera is riled from a centuries long slumber by a nuclear blast , and he 's not happy . Like Godzilla , he takes it out on Tokyo , setting the United Nations into motion to try and come up with a plan to save the planet . They arrive at ' Plan Z ' , the hope of the world , and wouldn't you know it , there 's a scene where a huge shed is shown that 's called the ' Z Plan ' building ; that was a nice touch . By the mid 1960 's , this country still wasn't quite politically correct . One of the American military scenes at the Alaskan Air Defense Sector has General Arnold asking a female sergeant to make coffee . I guess there weren't any privates around . Good old Gammera was quite the sight though , walking around on two legs and going for the flame throwing routine when challenged . That 's why it surprised me how Plan Z managed to capture turtle man in the nose cone of a hidden space ship , whisking him off to Mars to save the world . High fives all around for the American and Russian team that made the save , now let 's get back to the Cold War . Like Godzilla , Gammera spawned at least a good dozen films , but having seen this one pretty much satisfies my interest in flying , flaming turtles . Especially since that DVD pack I mentioned earlier has " Attack of the Monsters " with a featured guest appearance by the Big G . It took all I had to make it through to the end of both films ; it was such a relief to get to the final frame in this one that said ' Gammera , Sayonara ! "  
  Did anybody succeed in getting in this movie ? It 's a total mess to me : a vague historical / sentimental context instead of a plot , a pretentious imagery as mise en scene and it lasts two hours ! Shame on those who wasted money here .  
  Lethargic direction ruins an otherwise compelling period story that stars the wondrous Zhang Ziyi , in an excellent role as a woman who joins an extremist group in 1928 China , just prior to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria , and reunites with a former lover who is now working for Japan . Every bit of drama and forward motion of the story is sucked dry by director Ye Lou 's somnambulist directorial style . Characters stand still staring at each other for long minutes , saying nothing , hand-held cameras hold forever on faces showing interminable reactions way longer than they need to , edits repeat the same reaction is triple redundancy . We know nothing about the characters as the story begins and are given little new information as the story progresses , only silence and static shots of lovers who don't speak , who interaction through silent dances but share no apparent emotional intimacy . A very sleep inducing film .  
  This movie is a perfect adaptation of the English Flick Unfaithful . Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere , Emran that of Olivier and Malikka the perfect cheating wife role of Lane . They have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the Indian masses . Even then the movie has got the full traces of Unfaithful , though it couldn't catch up with the original . It was a cheap soft porn of the Bollywood lovers , where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show . Emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer . In the future if the Indian Directors plan to remake a English movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the Indian Censors . Though the film bombed at the box office , the actors got the undue recognition . In future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a Oscar nominated film . All said , this is not a family film , so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family .  
  It is quite simple . Friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults , with unsophisticated sense of humour . It is also painfully obvious that towards the end , they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons , most likely so they could say they beat Seinfeld 's 9 season run . The trouble with this is , Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing , Friends had ( and I 'm being very generous here ) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons . It became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren't that good so start with , then got worse at the 100th time you saw them . I find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly . It is truly awful .  
  This anime series starts out great : Interesting story , exciting events , interesting characters , beautifully rendered and executed . Not everything is explained right away , dangling a proverbial carrot before the viewer , enticing the viewer to watch each succeeding episode . But imagine the disappointment to find that the sci-fi thriller / giant robot adventure is only a backdrop for psycho-babble and quasi-religious preachy exploitation . If you want to hear " You 're OK . It 's good to be you . " after being embattled with negative slogans and the characters ' negative emotions , then this is for you . If you want a good sci-fi flick that is simply fun to watch , forget this one . Both the original , and the alternate endings were grossly disappointing to me . All that , AND this movie was too preachy .  
  Demer Daves , is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and " broken arrow " remains in everybody 's mind . As far as melodrama is concerned , he should leave that to knowing people like Vincente Minelli , George Cukor or the fabulous Douglas Sirk . The screenplay is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you are watching such a tepid weepie . Natalie Wood ' s character was inspired by Fannie Hurst 's " imitation of life " ( see Stahl and Sirk ) , but who could believe she 's a black man 's daughter anyway ? Susan Kohner was more credible in " imitation of life " ) and Sinatra and Curtis are given so stereotyped parts that they cannot do anything with them : the poor officer , and the wealthy good-looking - and mean - sergeant . Guess whom will Natalie fall in love with ? France is shown as a land of tolerance , where interracial unions are warmly welcome . At the time ( circa 1944 ) it was dubious , it still is for narrow-minded people you can find here there and everywhere .  
  This film reminded me so much of " A History of Violence " which pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up just being nothing short of a cheap action movie masquerading as some thinking film on violence . Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride move to a small English town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble . Don't these men have a job ? Anyway , Dustin takes all he can take and by the end of the film he holds up in his house and fights off each one of the drunk attackers by such gruesome means as boiling whiskey poured over someone , feet being blown off by a shotgun and someones head getting caught in a bear trap . Funny that someone would have a need for such a large bear trap in a small British town except maybe put a mans head in it . Sam Peckinpah who made the " Wild Bunch " which also covered the topic of blood letting violence in which no one was spared . But it was done with style , and you believed it . Straw Dogs is not believable . First of all the location is wrong and does not work . Why place it in England ? I would think maybe in some inner city location or a small town in the American South in the 1930 's or something . Second it is not in my view ever really explained clearly why these men are so quick to violence except maybe they got drunk and felt a need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife . Sam Peckinpah missed the mark on this one .  
  Like most of the festivals entries Hamiltons makes for an interesting watch a film thats all ideas and little execution . Although impressive for it 's obvious low budget the film falters in it 's final twist and becomes dreadfully long during it 's drawn out and obvious conclusion . The film is about a family of murderous outcasts trying to survive after there parents have died . They kidnap people , drain the blood from them and feed something locked away in their basement . There 's some nice darkly humorous performances from Mckellhar and Firgens and the rest are just so-so . The film never feels realistic or very disturbing for that matter . But for the first half taps into an oddly humorous and dark mixture which is a surprising accomplishment . The next half isn't so successful as it receeds into film oblivion with unrealistic twists into a ridiculously cocky finale that turns the entire film into utter crap . It 's a shame though there is no doubt that some talent was involved with this production and although deeply flawed it remains original and creative . too bad that when it comes to the delivery it completely fails on every level . * / 5  
  Minimal script , minimal character development , minimal steady camera . Maximum stretched scenes , maximum headache inducing jerky zooms , maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing . Up until the time flashes on the screen of 12:01pm , you can fast forward and miss nothing , since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing . To be fair , the movie does have some string music that was interesting , so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this . Unfortunately that was not to be , and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief . Forget about " Trigger Man " , I know I am trying to . - MERK  
  As others have mentioned , this movie is similar to THE FLY ( both versions ) and the lesser known sci-fi flick ALTERED STATES . The big difference is that those two movies were well made by people who knew what they were doing and were good at it . METAMORPHOSIS did not have these advantages . METAMORPHOSIS is a potentially interesting science fantasy story that had the wrong people in charge of it and the wrong actors playing the roles . The story follows scientist Dr . Peter Houseman ( Gene LeBrock ) , an obsessed man working on a genetic cure to aging and death . When the university he works for threatens to cut funding , he decides to inject the anti-aging serum into himself . As a result , Dr . Houseman spends the rest of the movie slowly turning into a lizard . And oh yes , watching the good doctor go through the process of becoming that lizard is a great joy . It really is so bad that it 's good . Some of the lines are classic : " What WAS it ? " " A nightmare .. from the past ! " Many of the reviews that I 've read for this point up how stupid and ridiculous the last five minutes of this movie are . I 'm just going to go ahead and spoil it : the good doctor goes from being a shuffling half-man , half-lizard thing to being what appears to be a man in a rejected Godzilla costume , when the police finally gun him down . In the final scene , some obnoxious kid is seen with a little pet lizard which he claims will never die , and the movie 's heroine , Sally Donnelly ( Catherine Baranov ) evidently decides that the little lizard is the final incarnation of Dr . Houseman . The camera then gives us a close-up of the lizard 's face ; this is , I assume , the director 's way of showing us that the lizard is EVIL . Yes , it is goofy , but I fell over laughing so I can't complain . I watched this movie because it was a part of the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Megapack that I purchased . I 'm sure many of those who are reading this did exactly the same thing , as the 50 pack is the only way to see this movie on DVD . If you have recently bought the boxed set and haven't watched this movie yet , it really is worth your time , even if I did just ruin the ending for you . It might also be possible to find this movie online for free .  
  I did not really want to watch this one . It seemed to be an old Raj Kanwar movie which disgusted me even before I started watching it because I don't consider him even close to being mediocre as a filmmaker . The only reason I took this one is obviously the Shahrukh Khan appearance in the film . I had not even known what the film was all about because I was sure it would be just an ordinary fairy tale . So I just imagined a love story between Shahrukh Khan and Divya Bharti with a substantial supporting role by Rishi Kapoor who I thought would be playing her father or uncle . And to my complete shock , Rishi Kapoor is actually the hero ! He is the one who romances the young Divya ! I was saddened to find out that Shahrukh had a small part of no substance and that too , only in the second part of this idiotic film . Just let me repeat the question : why would a 17 year-old lovely Divya have fallen for a 40-plus long haired , chubby , swollen piglet like Rishi Kapoor ? Rishi Kapoor should be ashamed of taking this part ; the only thing he did is ridiculing himself . He romanced a girl who could logically be younger than his own daughter and to make things worse - acts like a teenager at his forties . On top of that , just to make himself more pathetic , he plays a pop-star .. To make things clear , I have no problems with actors romancing ladies much younger than they themselves are . As long as they make a convincing couple , there should be no problem . In fact , leading actors have always been cast opposite young girls ( Amitabh Bachchan-Sridevi , Mithun Chakraborty-Madhuri Dixit , Shahrukh Khan-Deepika , Salman Khan-Sneha Ullal ) and made the pairing pretty well . Also , I have nothing against Rishi Kapoor , I think he is a good actor , and his act in Bobby is still well-engraved in my heart , but it 's not that he looks in this film like , say , Shahrukh Khan , Salman Khan or Aamir Khan look today . That was such a disappointment . Oh , and as for the reason every person actually watched this film , Shahrukh Khan made a good debut . He excelled in the very little his part allowed him to do . The late Divya Bharti made a promising debut as well . If you want to watch this film , go for the second half only . Personally , I would not do even that .  
  Nothing can prepare you for another lousy bimbo outing ! This time , it 's being brought to you by the never-inevitable Fred Olen Ray ! As far as exploitation movies go , this one doesn't click ! As science fiction , it 's plain unoriginal ! All that we see is an an ugly feminine android wearing a bikini out to destroy the Earth , and showing off all that 's nearly bare to resist ! Give me a f-ing break ! If this kind of entertainment is your thing , then why not dust off those old SI swimsuit mags from the attic for a change ? ! This would have been much better if it didn't set the sleaze factor on very high , but that still wouldn't make this one great . I 'd like to point out another film called THE ASSAULT ( 1996 ) by Jim Wynorski , which resembles the identity of ALIENATOR . It illustrates why top-notch 1st-person " femme fatale " action movies don't translate well in America . Sorry , fellas !  
  I am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad . It reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with one major difference : no porn . The story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul . Maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable . At the very least , the pacing should have been picked up . While I accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had , he should have spent more time on the story or better yet , get someone else to write it . Many of the action scenes were just pointless . It was a complete waste of my time .  
  It 's obvious that all of the good reviews posted for this movie so far are from insiders who were either involved with the film or who know somebody who knows somebody and have thus seen multiple cuts . Well , I don't know anyone involved , and I 've seen the final cut , and it is pure garbage . The only thing it has going for it is ambition and multiple cameos from horror legends ( none on screen for terribly long ) . It 's as if the filmmakers made this movie on a weekend during a horror convention and got actors like Tony Todd , Tom Savini , David Hess and Michael Berryman to film scenes during their coffee breaks . This is an ultra-cheap , shot-on-video wannabe X-Files with terrible acting from a cast of non-actors with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st century . There is little or no action ; it 's all overly explanatory dialogue that attempts to explain a pointlessly convoluted plot . Ther computer FX are a joke , but there aren't enough of them nor enough action to make this film enjoyable in a MST3K way . After about 8 straight scenes of nothing but talking , you 'll find yourself reaching for the fast-forward button .. and not letting go . Absolutely worthless .  
  Private Practice is supposed to be a medical drama . So I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines . Just by watching House , I " solved " two ( out of nine ) medical mysteries before the doctors did . Booring . Seriously , if you are a lazy writer , why not copy some cases out of older ER episodes or some obscure Brazilian medical soap ? House is recent and popular - recycling their ideas is hard to get away with .. Second biggest complaint : these people are supposed to be forty-somethings , right ? Then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15-year-olds ? Is three weeks ( ie . three whole damn episodes ) of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend doesn't want to be your " friend with benefits " , it 's maybe not because he wants to hurt you , but because he doesn't want to risk your friendship ? The character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you can't really buy into the supposed " drama " . And I won't even start complaining about what the show did to everyone 's favorite Addison as we got to know her in Grey 's Anatomy .. On a sidenote , don't you think it 's funny the way Addison ends up lusting after loser Pete ( sorry , but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with Mozart 's Requiem is a loser , PhD or not ) and Derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny , irritating Meredith miles away in rainy Seattle ? Apart from that little fling with Mark , they seemed to be perfect for each other . Sometimes I think Shonda Rhimes ' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships , our first choice is often the right one ..  
  I think I should start this in saying that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in parts . The true test is whether it is good from start to finish , which is the reason I gave the analogical title for this review . Most of us would agree-even those like me , who enjoy reading many blogs-that blogs can't compare with good novel writing for a number of reasons . Likewise , FEM can't compare with good film making for a number of reasons , and I actually believe it 's a poor example of independent filmography . From start to finish , FEM feels like a pieced together vlog . ( Heck , even MySpace gets some pimping . ) If I wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15-I don't-I 'd go watch it . FEM , while certainly grittier than the bubble gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media , is so personal that it is without an interesting story . It 's like watching the mundaneness of life , which I think most would agree is very naturally boring . And yet the creators of FEM want us to applaud it , their very postmodern film about making a film . Cue my yawn . Ultimately , I come away not caring the least bit about any of it . I 'm shocked that I 'm actually interested in taking time out to write this review , even . It 's not that FEM is downright bad , because it isn't ; it has a few moments where I crack a smile or think that maybe-just maybe-something of interest is about to happen . It 's rather that it 's just downright .. mediocre . I feel so indifferent about it that it 's almost fitting of an oxymoron : passionate indifference . I hope the creators / " actors " in the film get out of debt from their efforts . They 'll probably need it for when one of them moves out and moves on with life . See this movie if you 've got time to waste and nothing much you want to do ; otherwise , pass it by , and don't worry that you 've missed some great , undiscovered talent . You really haven't .  
  The Christmas Secret was touted as a wonderful film , but I was truly disappointed . They even sold VHS and DVD copies of the film when it was over , which leads me to think the producers were really proud of this project . As a screen actor myself I felt most of the performances were phoned in , although Beau Bridges , as Nick , did have a moment or two . If I were Richard Thomas I would not put this film on my otherwise fine resume . It was an embarrassment . I had been a fan since his Waltons days , but have found myself untempted to watch any of his subsequent work , so poor was this offering . In defence of the actors , the directing was stilted , mechanical , and thoroughly amateurish . I hope this is not considered a spiteful review and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic . I turned the movie on because it had a good cast and I was prepared to enjoy the film . However I would challenge any one out there to watch this film and not wish for their money back , even though it was on T.V.  
  The movie starts with a nice song Looks like a thriller , with Arbaaz Khan walking around in a suspicious way but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy With the routine stupid idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar , Sharman , Kunal and Rajpal acting like grown up kids Their scenes are quite funny first and then get boring There is a bored sub plot of Tanushree 's brother being killed Towards the end the film tries to get serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets even stupid Then a lengthy bashing bashing climax straight out of HERA PHERI and wait , there is also a long chase in Payal 's house The film is so boring that it makes you fall asleep Direction by Priyan is very bad music ( Pritam ) is routine except the first song Cinematography is bad , the film has a cheap look throughout Rajpal Yadav is good in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent and i was happy that the actor isn't loud and over the top like other films But No , He becomes his usual self and gets irritating most of the times Tusshar should not speak in a film , his dial delivery is terrible Sharman is the saving grace , He is the sole actor who acts very well in this film Kunal Khemmu tries hard in his first comic film as an adult , But doesn't impress much Tanushree is bad as always Arbaaz Khan gets less scope and is usual Payal is a non actress Murli Sharma is terrible  
  .. they bothered making this movie ? Anyone ? I didn't think so . If you are looking for a coming-of-age movie , go rent Summer of ' 42 . This is no Summer of ' 42 . When your big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard , & Sarsgaard gets more screen time , that is your first warning sign And , of course , for such an " artsy " movie , there is plenty of cursing & skin flung around , just to make it look " artsy " . Sarsgaard did his usual uninteresting , cardboard character , punctuated by moments that were supposed to be intense . The intensity is that of someone with bi-polar disorder . Miller is most famous for her looks & what she had to say about the city of Pittsburgh after this movie . Pittsburgh SHOULD hold a grudge against her . She misrepresented an actual Pittsburgh native . Foster gave Sarsgaard a run for his money in the cardboard acting style . Wow ! Was this his first role after high school graduation ? So , we have this weird triangle . Foster has a crush on Miller , but is with his boss / girlfriend . He can't take Miller to bed , & won't take his boss to bed . So , he hangs with Sarsgaard & Miller , & watches them get it on . Then , after one of Sarsgaard 's pseudo-intense moments , Foster & Miller get it on , a scene that we are " treated " to in every sloppy , moaning detail . Finally , just to round it all out , Foster & Sarsgaard get it on , with Foster in the Miller role . Now I know how 2 guys get it on ( as if that was ever anything I needed to know ) . After all that , all that 's left is the tragic ending for one character & the retrospective views of the remaining 2 . It gets me right in the pit of my stomach . Oh , wait ! That was the pepperoni pizza I just had . I 'd like back the time this movie took out of my life , please .  
  Of all the films I have seen , this one , The Rage , has got to be one of the worst yet . The direction , LOGIC , continuity , changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain . " How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy " ? Gary Busey is know for his " B " movies , but this is a sure " W " movie . ( W = waste ) . Take for example : about two dozen FBI & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer . Inside the jeep is MA and is " confused " as to why all the cops are about . Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues , MA being killed straight off . The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them . The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet / pellet . MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough . Truly a miracle , not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle .  
  This movie is a pathetic attempt , apparently , to justify the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau . In order to do this , they cast a 19-year-old - well , probably not " in order to do this . " There was no way they could have cast a 12 or 13 year old as the boy because the love scenes would have grossed everyone out ( if they had even been allowed to do them ) - as they should . Mary Ann 's boyfriend was my nephew 's age , making her a pedophile . Sixth grade , people . The definition of pedophile doesn't have to include many children - all you need is one . I really don't care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage . She had a responsibility to her students that she did not live up to . The reason given is that she is bipolar , rejected the diagnosis , and refused to take her medication . It 's understandable , then , that she was not thinking rationally . One hopes that she now understands her actions . Now that she and Vili are married and have two children together , I pray that she is on her medication and thinking clearly . All that aside , Penelope Ann Miller was totally convincing and perfect casting for the role .  
  When I was a kid we always used to be babysat , and we always used to rent a film or see a film at the cinema . This is one of the films we watched . This is one of the stupidest films I 've ever seen , I think it might even be a Walt Disney Pictures film ! A martian is dropped on earth , turns into a human , befriends a human , and is trying everything he can to get back home . But he is distracted by the wonders of the Earth . The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors , Back to the Future 's Christopher Lloyd as the martian , Uncle Martin , Dumb and Dumber 's Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara , Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie . But apart from that it 's complete crap . Poor !  
  If this movie had not been labeled a Disney picture , I probably would not have been so disappointed . The nudity was unnecessary and did not add anything . The same can be said for the toilet bowl scene . This is one Disney film that I will not let my four year old nephew watch .  
  Shazbot , is this embarrassing . In fact , here 's a list of 100 that makes up the embarrassment : 1 . ) a failed comeback for Christopher Lloyd . 2 . ) Jeff Daniels basically playing the same role he played in the live 101 Dalmatians remake which wasn't too juicy to begin with . He sure has a funny way of promoting his Purple Rose Theatre .. 3 . ) Disnefluff . 4 . ) another disappointing reminder that Wallace Shawn is to Disney what Jet Li was to Bob Hoskins in Unleashed . 5 . ) Ray Walston , the original martian from the TV series , played a bit part ( read " cameo " ) in this flick and died two years later of lupus . Coincidence ? 6 . ) awful special effects . Seriously - awful . 7 . - 100 . ) that damn talking , farting suit voiced to an annoying degree by Wayne Knight ( " Newman ! " ) . My favorite scene ? HA ! HA ha , ha ! Ha ha ha ha ha .. Whew ! .. Good one . You - You 're a joker . Okay , let 's wrap up this review with a moment of silence for this franchise 's agonizing death , and if you would like , you can say a quick prayer that Disney doesn't forget this travesty and do something silly like a movie adaptation of " Mork and Mindy " starring Tim Allen ..  
  I disliked this movie for numerous reasons . Within the first ten minutes of the film , I grew extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to salvage itself , for me at least , that it was going to have to pull itself out of the enormous hole it had dug . Unfortunately , that did not occur . The two draws of the movie for me were to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman . I don't know enough about Lindsey Lohan 's work to have been interested in what she would bring to the film . Afterward , I just felt disappointed in and for all three of them even though there were " moments " in each of their performances . I imagine that for each of them to find their " moments " was a very difficult task given the fact that there was an amazing lack of character development and uninspired dialog . Although the plot is an interesting one , the movie on the whole is so poorly written , directed and edited that anybody 's performance as an actor would suffer and be tainted by it . The disrespectful way in which it dealt with sexual abuse and the trite and insulting viewpoint of small-town America , I think , were the two main reasons why this film failed in hitting it 's mark . As one reviewer has noted and I would agree , the movie is almost impossible to market given it 's finished form . I suspect that , or at least hope that ( for the actor 's sakes anyway ) there are some real gems on the cutting room floor . Sad for us but if that 's true then the actors can take solace in that and feel somewhat good about lending their talents and time to such a flop . Oh yeah and another thing .. I wished for just once I could go see an American movie which included the sadly disappearing but wonderfully bucolic settings such as the one in this film where the main characters weren't absentmindedly and / or disrespectfully littering the country side with pop cans , smashed CDs and , other such trash !  
  Revolt of the Zombies is BAD . There is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie . It is dull , lifeless , poorly acted , and poorly scripted . I 've often complained that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste , well this movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride . The 65 minute running time seemed like 165 minutes . The story : An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through " zombification " . One man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him . Once this happens , he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences . That 's it . That 's the whole story . For most of the movie , I was trying to figure out where I had seen the male lead . He looked so familiar . I had plenty of time to think this over . Nothing was happening in the movie . Just before the " zombies revolted " , it hit me . It was Dean Jagger . I had seen him recently as the General in White Christmas . This is how I " entertained " myself throughout most of the movie . I 'm just glad I didn't buy the DVD for this movie . King of the Zombies is on the other side and it 's a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie . For what it 's worth , I 'll give it a 2/10 . ( I won't go to 1/10 because , believe it or not , I 've seen worse . )  
  Probably the worst Dolph film ever . There 's nothing you 'd want or expect here . Don't waste your time . Dolph plays a miserable cop with no interests in life . His brother gets killed and Dolph tries to figure things out . The character is just plain stupid and stumbles around aimlessly . Pointless .  
  Dolph Lundgren stars as Murray Wilson an alcoholic ex-cop who gets involved with a serial killer who kills during sex , after his brother is murdered , Wilson starts his own investigation and finds out a lot of his brother 's secrets in this very dull thriller . Lundgren mails in his performance and the movie is flat and lethargic . Also when has anyone watched a Dolph Lundgren movie for anything but action ?  
  " Godzilla vs King Ghidorah " is a perfect example how a great idea can be ruined by pathetic topics like pseudo-patriotism . Here , travellers from the future try to ruin Japan , replacing the local hero Godzilla with their puppy monster , the three-headed golden dragon King Ghidorah . They fail , however and in the end Godzilla fights Ghidorah . The battles between the two behemoths are very cool , but the plot of the movie is full with holes and the all thing about " Japan is great " is really stupid . The creators of this movie didn't even threat with respect the enemies of Japan , making them stupid big blond guys , who are easily outsmarted by the clever Japanese . The good thing is that in the end Godzilla and king Ghidorah nearly destroyed the both Japan and it 's ridiculous enemies in one ( actually two ) spectacular combats . But till this battle royale , the film was really dull and pathetic .  
  This is one of those movies in which people keep saying " That 's a great idea ! " about the worst ideas you 've ever heard . Then they act on them . I like it . This picture 's funnier than any 3 dozen Seth Rogen projects . Well , so is SHOAH . Gojira movies have been cannibalizing their own origin-stories since the 60s , but this one goes further . What can you say about a culture willing to rape its own sacred cultural icons for a quick buck ? This travesty presents a WW2 suicide brigade on " the last of the Marshall Islands " presenting arms to a dinosaur who chased the US Marines away . Then the Japanese inexplicably decide not to fight to the last man , and instead abandon the territory annexed on their behalf by this giant lizard . They retreat to the mainland , where one of them becomes a business tycoon . Then it gets complicated . Blonde men from the future , irritable over not yet curing male pattern baldness , come back in time in a sort of flying saucer to ask a failed writer and a celebrity psychic for their help in eliminating Godzilla before he destroys Japan . The " help " is questionable , as all these 1992 citizens do is go back to 1944 to watch some closed-circuit TV , but , hey , they shot the script . You would think that by the 90s the Japanese would know better than to trust people in spaceships . Fortunately for Nippon , the white guys - you can tell they 're American because they say " nucyaler " - erred by bringing back in time the one Japanese girl left in the future . In a touching display of ancestor worship , she outs their duplicity after donning a flying suit made from ductwork taped to a Sailor Moon backpack . Turns out these time-traveling , fashion-disabled Caucasians are just jealous of Japan 's impending economic imperialist takeover of the known world ( in the 22d century Japan 's going to buy Africa , which sounds more like a liability than an asset ) . These blondes in padded chintz suits with nonfunctioning straps and redundant zippers want to replace Godzilla with King Ghidorah , who will destroy all of Japan except Tokyo . A strange choice , but Toho 's been known to go out of its way not to have to build that Tokyo skyline set again . Sure enough , we are given the alternate spectacle of Fukuoka ( " my garden city " ) and some other heretofore unscathed by rubber monster metropolitan areas being laid waste by a flying gold metalflake 1/3 of a hydra . In a surprise revelation , we are informed that King Ghidorah was created from some hand puppets left too long in the microwave . Godzilla also does his share of demolition as the movie winds down . Wait - didn't the spaceship blondes already destroy Godzilla ? Yeah , they killed him in the third reel . But nobody expected that the Japanese of 1992 had a secret submarine filled with nuclear missiles - " Ha ha , don't worry . We don't keep it in Japanese waters " - with which to jumpstart a new Godzilla from the bones of an old dinosaur . Only they don't have to , because a leaky old nuclear shipwreck has already made Godzilla whole again . Oh , and Godzilla finally gets to Tokyo , reuniting with his old army buddy in a heartwarming moment of tearful recognition . They look into each other 's eyes , and Godzilla nods as if to say , " Gotta do it , man . " The tycoon nods in understanding . Then Godzilla blows him up . I should also mention here that , in order to prevent Godzilla 's revamped angry self from fulfilling his destiny and destroying Japan , the Japanese girl from the future goes BACK to the future to ask for help from - yes - a balding white man . Probably because he pities her as the sole Asian character from the 23d century , he agrees to build a Mecha-Ghidora and send it back to the 1990s , so that together , these two giant monsters can , uh , fulfill Godzilla 's destiny and destroy Japan . In a wonderful nod to those notoriously self-willed whipping heads , the girl piloting Mecha-Ghidora has trouble controlling the joystick . This Godzilla suit design owes much to the Sumo - his thighs are flabby enough to double for Rush Limbaugh 's , and his belly and chest are thick and ponderous . But there 's more exploding masonry in this picture than in most of his adventures , which makes up for a lot . Also features a man with a passing resemblance to Robert Patrick playing a killer robot . Yes , in the future even the robots will have bald spots . Plus Megumi Odaka , reprising her role as Micki , the only Japanese girl ever born with ears larger than her Disney namesake and an acting style even bigger than that . It 's not her fault : many Japanese directors seem to feel that a seventy-foot screen isn't quite large enough to display the emotion of a human face . I did some acting for Japanese television , and I can tell you , they push you to go for it . They apparently urge their writers in the same way . Thank God .  
  I can't believe the positive reviews of this movie - I thought it was one of the worst , most poorly executed and poorly acted movies I have ever seen . And the plot was completely ludicrous ( sp ? ) . She starts making out with him while he 's tied to the chair ? puh-lease . The worst part was that it wasn't even bad in a good , laughable way . Just plain terrible - I couldn't figure out why they even bothered to show it on HBO . I thought Belushi was ridiculously silly - very unbelievable as an " eccentric " hit man . idk , I could go on - again , I am shocked by the positive reviews . The only thing that kept me watching it is that it 's fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad . And the ending didn't disappoint in its silliness either ! " live by the sword , die by the sword .. " ridiculous .  
  It 's funny , when you stop and think about it : fright film fans tend to a deep and abiding affection toward those who scare the daylights out of them . THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE may give us nightmares , but who among us ( the Faithful ) didn't feel a very real twinge of love for Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE - or for Ken Foree , forever and ever the resolute hero of the original DAWN OF THE DEAD ? His cameo in the remake made me want to stand up and cheer ( as did Tom Savini 's cameo ) ; I kid you not . And Brian Halloran and .. Well , you get my drift ( if not , just stand downwind .. ) . These are some of the Heroes of Horror . To see this many of them gathered together in a single movie is almost unheard of ( at least to this degree , to my knowledge ) . If only the writer ( s ) had been up to such a monumental task . Maybe someone else , somewhere along the line , will try again . As long as it 's not another half-hearted effort ( like BROTHERHOOD OF BLOOD , for instance ) .  
  Nikolai Gogol 's story " Viy " has been filmed again and released to home video in the US via Faith Films . The original story concerns a priest who has to watch over the body of a witch with only his faith to protect him . Greatly expanded and set in America , though clearly filmed in Russia ( the houses , clothing and furnishing are all wrong despite the English signs ) , this is an odd film that doesn't really work . Part of it is the weird setting that tries very hard to be backwoods America but clearly isn't . There are also some weird , intentionally oblique moments as the main character being a reporter at the start and a priest a short time later . I 'm not sure why they did that , even after watching the making of piece on the DVD ) The other problem is the dubbing which is beyond awful . Its done in such away that everyone speaks when their lips are not on camera - or if they are the voices don't even remotely match the lip flaps . I don't know if its Faith Films fault or that of the producers who made the film hoping to dump into the West ( revealed in the making of piece ) . The film isn't very good . As I 've said it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this an odd ball curio . Despite some really good looking horror images the film never works as a horror film . As film to engender faith its much too confused in this retelling to amount to make anyone feel anyone closer to god . Given the choice I 'd give it a pass , even at a bargain bin price . My advice would be to find the 1960 's version of the tale called Viy which will bring both some shivers and some understanding about a belief in god .  
  With the runaway success of " God 's Army " , every Mormon with a camera seems to be trying to make a movie now . In the case of the recent " The Other Side of Heaven " , this wasn't at all a bad thing . That film , while not great , was quite good . " The Singles Ward " , however , is not . Telling the story of a young , divorced Mormon guy thrust back into single life , the writing and shooting style of " The Singles Ward " is , in many ways , very similar to the 80s comedy " Ferris Bueller 's Day Off " . However , the similarities end there . While " Ferris Bueller " was funny , original , and well-acted ( as far as stupid comedies like this ever are ) , " The Singles Ward " is completely the opposite . It tries very hard to be funny . However , 90 % of the gags either fall flat or are cliches and jokes you 've probably heard a million times before . The other 10 % seem to be thrown in to fill out the time . And the acting , while not awful , is amaturish at best . In addition , if you 're not either a Mormon yourself , or very , VERY familiar with Mormon culture , you won't get hardly anything at all . Whereas " God 's Army " and " The Other Side of Heaven " were appealing to a broad range of viewers , both inside and outside of the Mormon church , this film is most definitely one big inside joke , and even if you get it , it 's just not that funny .  
  Using tons of stock footage , not only from Trader Horn but also the first two films in the series ( for example the alligator fight was used last time out ) this is one of the weakest films in the MGM series . Its a huge let down after the classic Tarzan and His Mate which is possibly the best film in the series . The plot has Jane 's cousins coming into the jungle to tell her that she has inherited a fortune if she 'll come back to claim it . They are kind of in the bind since the relative that left her the money cut them out of the will . Hiring a great white hunter , who secretly wishes to capture Tarzan and sell him , the pair heads into the jungle where they run into the usual jungle troubles ( more so because of the stock footage ) . After lots of talk Jane decides to go back to civilization and we get long sequences of Tarzan and Jame making kissy face . Finally into the last half hour the plot to capture Tarzan is put in motion and things at last become interesting as plans go awry and things look very grim for all concerned .. Painfully dull film is clear evidence of a troubled production . the film seems to have been assembled from several different films with the first half hour playing as an almost exact repeats of the previous film . The middle third shows signs of having to stretch things out and having plot lines that ultimately went nowhere . The last third where Tarzan is captured and the party is put into peril is the point that the film finally comes to life ( it also shows signs of the graphic violence that caused much of the need to re-shoot the film ) . To me its a great wonder how the series managed to continue on from here since this film isn't very good ( except at the end ) . I would be hard pressed to explain it except I would have to say that it was the relationship between Weissmuller and O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane which kept people coming back . Its a beautifully acted pairing and really is one of the screens great couples . ( I should probably also mention that this is the point that the film became less real and more fantastical with the appearance of the Tarzan tree house . ) I really dislike the first hour or so of this film a great deal and find it a great waste of time and energy . If you can come in towards the end I would recommend giving the film a try . Otherwise I would just skip the whole film and move on to the next film in the series .  
  I just saw this movie ( mainly because Brady Corbet is in it ) , and I must say that I was not pleased . Of course , the computer graphics were amazing , but the story line needed a little touch-up . Also , I think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood , as well if it were rated PG-13 . That would definitely attract more people to see it->teens . What would also attract more teens ( particularly teen girls ) , would be a large close up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster ! Even though the movie had it 's down points , I still saw it and thought it was okay !  
  This movie is one reason IMDB should allow a vote of 0/10 . The acting is awful , even what some here have lauded , the Carpathia character ! The script looks like it was written in haste . In one scene , the black preacher who was left behind , when asked by Buck what " dan7 " in the computer graphic meant , said , " Daniel 7 , * CHAPTER * 24 . " He probably meant VERSE 24 , but the film makers missed this slip up . Perhaps the worst part is that the film 's eschatological position is Biblically unsound . While many Christians have espoused the film 's interpretation of end-time events , such interpretation , in * my opinion * , is faulty . To understand these flaws , read " Christians Will Go Through The Tribulation " by Jim McKeever and " The Blessed Hope , A Biblical Study of the Second Advent and the Rapture " by George E . Ladd .  
  Left Behind is the kind of " we know what we know cause we know it " movie that Christians ( and most any other naive person ) needs to help them feel like what they " THINK " and " BELIEVE " ( not " KNOW " ) is right . But , at the same time I feel bad for the little guys , because this is not a well made film . It does not help ANY message . I work at a video store , and I KNOW the ONLY reason people went to see this movie was because they were religious and they thought it was . ANYBODY on this earth who THINKS they know what will happen in the future is wrong , unless they think they know that they don't know . I 've had about enough ( but only after I 've had too much ) of these people walking around with their noses in the air thinking that a movies starring a semi-talented TV actor means something above me . Please , if you love yourself you 'll stay away . I refuse to go into any detail about this movie ( not because A-I didn't see it ( because I did ) , B-it was too shocking for my atheist-self to handle ( because it wasn't ) , or C-I really don't have anything to say bad about it ( because I do ) . The Reason , ( which is a word nobody who helped make this movie understands ) is that I want this movie out of my head , I want that it was made out of my head , I want that I watched ALL OF IT WITH AN OPEN MIND out of my head , I want the message that Kirk so proudly and coachly gives at the end of the movie out of my head . I only want all the things that were in my head BEFORE viewing this movies there , anything directly connected with this movie that 's floating in my head GET OUT ! My peaceful rage is ending . I 'm sorry that somebody in this world went to the theater to see this movie about what could happen in the future ( but won't ) when they could have given that Seven Dollars Plus to any number of Human , Animal , or Rain Forest charity . But if they did that then they wouldn't be able to " BELIEVE " in the fact that it 's real , they might have to fact what is . LEFT BEHIND ZERO ( out of * )  
  Vodka Lemon is a charming , yet extremely uneven Arminian film that will delight some and bore others . Though reasonably well-crafted , the film lacks any real " zing " , relying instead on many scenes that will seem commonplace to the astute art-house viewer . The film contains a handful of moments of sheer cinematic brilliance , unfortunately , they deserve a film worthy of their genius . Too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama , Vodka Lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately disgruntled . You may laugh , but these moments will be few and far between amid a sea of washed out snow filled landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides . A noble effort , ultimately done in by lack of narrative cohesion .  
  The London Underground has something inherently creepy about it , with its long winding tunnels , the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground , and of course the rats roaming the tracks . It a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often . It was used in the seventies horror Deathline aka Raw Meat , featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel , and the celebrated chase sequence in American Werewolf in London . So I was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent UK production Creep . I thought the film started off well , with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving , followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of London . However , Creep went downhill from here , and I found myself wishing that I 'd switched it off after this opening scene , leaving me with a favourable impression of the film . All the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable , even Potente herself , and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness . he also made the mistake of showing the " monster " in full lighting , where he ceases to become remotely scary , and reveals his name to be Craig . How can you have a monster called Craig ? It turns into an X Files-type thing , and reminds one of the episode Tombs . In fact , I was wishing Mulder and Scully would turn up and sort them all out for me . As for the infamous sexualised violence , it is very graphic , disturbing and totally unnecessary . It seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value . The trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror , which is a mistake as it 's only halfway through the film . So there you go . The only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from Ken Campbell , one of my favourite occasional actors . You don't see him very often , but when he 's on screen he acts everyone else into a corner . Casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius , unfortunately the only one evident in the film .  
  I bought this movie exciting a gloriously gratuitous , over the top , entertaining bloodbath . I got none of them . This film fails on practically every level , not in the least frightening , or funny , it is simply terrible film-making , and never provides the audience with anything worth seeing . What is so bad about it is that far from being as raw , violent and brutal as it had promised to be , there is very little violence at all . Virtually no blood shed , and no excitement whatsoever . Acting , direction and dialogue is absolutely unbearable . Honestly , it is truly laughable . I could hardly sit through this total garbage once ; I certainly will never want to watch it again . Don't waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this ; it is truly possibly the worst film ever made . If I could give it minus stars , I would .  
  I can't say this is the worst movie ever made , but personally I think of it that way because when it was originally released in theaters , ( 1 ) the initial buzz was positive enough that my girlfriend insisted we go see it , and we actually STOOD IN LINE to get tickets , and ( 2 ) it 's still the only " serious " film I recall where the audience started snickering at a certain point and basically laughed at the movie the rest of the way through . Once we reached the infamous ( and interminable ) snake fight scene , I think everyone gave up . The only positive I can concede is the lush location shooting . Oh , and there 's also Bo 's breasts , although her acting is so wooden that the nudity is unerotic and doesn't rate much more than a Playboy pictorial . The " dramatic tension " in this film is between Bo 's terrible acting and her husband 's horrible direction . The snake fight has to be one of the most incompetent " action " sequences ever filmed . However , this is one of those films that 's bad enough , it may be worth watching on the level of unintentional humor . Definitely the worst film I ever paid to see .  
  " Smokey And The Bandit " wasn't exactly Shakespeare , but then nobody wanted it to be . It was lowdown slapstick , but it did have brains . It had a very smart script with definable characters and a fun wrap-up . People came out of the theater smiling . " Hooper " provides none of this . There is no reason to smile . If it 's supposed to be a tribute to the Hollywood Stuntman , it makes them look awfully lazy by providing nothing but badly-choreographed fight scenes and one of the most unconvincing car-jumps I 've ever seen . It all looks phony , badly-filmed almost on purpose . Poor Sally Field ( as the girlfriend who wrings her hands on the sidelines ) is given her weakest role , with not a single funny or smart line ( " If you do that jump , I won't be here when you get back " ) . Burt Reynolds keeps looking at the camera and winking , but the joke is on any audience who sits through " Hooper " . * from *  
  So they hyped the violence and it 's been branded as sick . Well , the violence is the best bit I 'm afraid , but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they go on their ( entirely predictable ) rampage . This film has a truly dreadful script . We never get a chance to get to know Robert and his actions at the end are just plain pathetic . The acting isn't much better , either , the worst of them being the TV chef and the school teacher . The direction is clumsy , the pace enough to send you to sleep . And what on earth is the school film project all about ? A comment on the film itself perhaps ? The use of newsreel during the climactic murder is laughable . These guys obviously think they 're intellectuals but are hopelessly out of their depth . How on earth they got the great Yorgos Arvanitis to light it I 'll never know . And how they got the money to make it in the first place is an even greater mystery . Absolutely awful beyond comprehension .  
  When THE MAGIC OF LASSIE opened at Radio City Music Hall , I was foolish enough to believe it would be as heart-warming as some of the first Lassie films were . Not . The story was abysmal , the songs by the Sherman brothers were way below their usual level , the characters were uninspired and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY had both seen much better days . Then too , I was interested in seeing what ALICE FAYE 's contribution would be like , since she 'd been absent from the screen for so many years and was always so fetching in her earlier roles at Fox . Alice too , was letdown by the foolish script and the unflattering photography . Another disappointment . Nothing original here , nothing even remotely interesting for an adult to enjoy-and clearly , no magic present for anyone . You can skip this one without missing a thing .  
  I give this movie 3 out of 10 because I have watched zillions of movies and I can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind-teasing message should look like . Definitely , The Broken is not one of those movies . I have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations I 've read in prior comments , they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people . the photo on the cover clearly shows that the Broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain . It 's a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless . So , you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before . Though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue . Had the clues been planted more in the movie , one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed . But though the movie was so slow in pace , it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all . And the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil Gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments . Furthermore , if Gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end , then how come she is the evil one ? I bet I can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion : This movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time . Obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all . I am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies . Horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages ! They 're supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest , I guess . Horror movies should have blood , screams , intensity , skeletons , body organs and parts . Because that is the real horror and it 's never away from reality . I have watched almost all horror movies and I can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising . Nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of . For instance , the horror movie " Train " with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with " Hostel " , it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them . And even if we considered the Broken a movie that has an existential message , it is still very poorly presented and the least scary . I prefer the addiction message presented in Requiem for a Dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex , TV , safety / being pampered , etc .. can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me . And those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial , are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply don't like this genre but this doesn't mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils , ecstasy , leadership lessons ( believe it or not ! ) , entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life , as ugly and scary as it may seems , Death !  
  This is the most cliche ridden and worst romantic comedy I have ever seen . Every scene is cringe worthy and the two lead actors - Corey and Danny are soo annoying . Corey is very dumb and naive and should have never listened to Danny 's false promises . Neve Campbell and the killer from Urban Legend are the only redeeming qualities in this poor attempt of a film . Danny ( Dean Paras ) looks in his late thirties and the girl he 's trying to bed - Corey looks as if she 's still in college . Here in Australia , this film is called Too Smooth ; there is nothing smooth about this film at all . 1/10 Avoid  
  I am a great fan of Martin Amis , on whose book this film is based . Unfortunately the director has been unable to translate the book to the screen . The novel is thoroughly post modern and highly artificial in its wildly overblown characters and the disintegration of traditional plot line and character development . It is an hilarious examination of human greed , excess and emptiness by one of the most moral of contemporary British writers . The director of the film has completely missed the point of the novel . In his hands , the film screams along at breakneck speed , indulging in every known trick shot and ' odd ' camera angle possible . It is like Ken Russel on acid , and suffers from that older director 's self indulgence cranked up to a hundred . Not even the ( brief ) glimpse of gorgeous actor Christian Solimeno 's penis was enough to save this wretched film for me . Abysmal !  
  Utterly pretentious nonsense . The material is dull , dull , dull , and most of the cast wouldn't even have made understudies in Allen 's earlier films . And to have to listen to the unfunny Will Ferrell do his Woody Allen imitation makes me loathe the second-rate ( though mysteriously popular ) Ferrell even more . It appears that the morose 70-year old Allen should have knocked off work when the clock rang in a new century . I truly tried to get involved in the film , but it was just impossible ; my snyapses couldn't fire that slowly . So , rather than doze off and kill the afternoon sleeping in an upright position I got up , left my wife and daughter in the theater , and went out to the car where I had a really good book to re-read ( George Bailey 's great tome of 30 years ago , " Germans . " ) The day turned out pretty well after all , no thanks to Woody .  
  This movie was amusing at times , hell sometimes it was even downright funny . The underlying message I got from the film though , was that women are responsible for all of the troubles of man . Every time a woman is depicted in the film , she is being lazy , being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason . I don't think the message involved is good for women or gay men . But , it is a comedy , and a piece of art , so it is simply someones point of view . Even if I don't agree with it , they are still entitled to it . An amusing film , but some of the comments others have made are just plain stupid . Best film ever my foot .  
  Gayniggers from Outer Space is a short foreign film about black , gay aliens who explore the galaxy until they stumble upon Earth . Being gay , their goal is to have a male-only universe in which all people are gay . Hence , when they discover women or " female creatures " live on Earth , they are at first terrified ; eventually they decide to eliminate all women on the planet and liberate the male population . An offensive title with a racist , homophobic and sexist storyline , albeit probably intended as a satire , give this film some shock value . However , there 's little substance underneath . As another reviewer pointed out , there are few jokes besides the characters ' names ( eg . ArmInAss ) ; I think I laughed once at one small gay joke . I think I got the point of the film quickly , a satire of bad science fiction , but after that I had had enough ; I kept wanting the film to end already ( and it is a short film ! ) . Not brilliant or particularly well-written .  
  I really wanted to like this movie , but it was just imposable . The acting was ultra hammy , the plot was annoying , and the pace was SLOW , soo sloww . The whole time sitting in the theater i wanted the movie to end . Twenty minuets into a films and I 'm praying for an ending . Sure some of the visuals were nice , but c'mon guys , I mean really ! And for a movie about a guy tuning magical instruments there really wasn't much music to speak of . The music there was was annoying , and boring . There were sound loud shrill sounds at times too , those were also annoying . Mainly this film managed to bore me , and creep me out at the same time . I 'm glad its over . I need to go see " Tideland " and wash this bad taste out of my mouth .  
  Night of the Comet starts as the world prepares for a once in a lifetime event , the passing of a 65 million plus year old comet . Instead of watching the light show Regina Belmont ( Catherine Mary Stewart ) decides to spend the night with cinema projectionist Larry Dupree ( Michael Bowen ) in his booth .. They awake the next morning & as Larry attempts to leave the cinema he is attacked & killed by a zombie , the same zombie attacks Regina but she manages to escape where upon she discovers that almost everyone on the entire planet has been turned into red dust . Almost everyone because by some amazing coincidence the only other person to survive happens to be her sister Samantha ( Kelli Maroney ) , they desperately search for more survivors & meet up with a long distance trucker named Hector Gomez ( Robert Beltran ) . Meanwhile an evil bunch of scientists need human blood to develop a serum to save themselves from turning into dust & they 're on the look out for unwilling donors .. Written & directed by Thom Eberhardt I found Night of the Comet a pretty rubbish viewing experience , I 'm surprised at the amount of positive comments on IMDb about it because I just thought it was boring crap that never lived up to it 's potential . The script starts off 100 miles an hour with the obliteration of the entire population of Earth & a zombie attack but then it goes absolutely nowhere & then eventually introduces the sinister blood stealing scientists towards the end of the film because by that time the slim story has run it 's course . There are plot holes too , if these scientists want blood why shoot the three or four gang members & save the two sisters when the guys would have provided more blood for their experiments , killing them just seemed a totally bizarre & an almost suicidal thing to do considering they need blood to develop a cure , it just doesn't make sense I mean if your going to die & you need to experiment on human blood would rather have five or six donors providing blood or just two ? I 'm not having the fact that the two sisters survived independently of each other , I mean what are the odds on that ? When Hector confronts the female scientist for the first time she never mentions Samantha or where she was or where the underground facility was where they took Regina before she committed suicide so how did Hector know these things ? I also thought after the first twenty odd minutes the film slows down to a snails pace & became incredibly boring & dull to watch , after hearing so many good things about it Night of the Comet comes across to me as nothing more than an overrated boring piece of crap . Director Eberhardt does a really good job , I liked the look of the film with it 's red tinted sky & he manages to create a really cool atmosphere of isolation . Unfortunately there are far too many shots of empty streets , there are constant montage 's of empty streets , deserted roads & abandoned buildings & it gets extremely repetitive & dull . OK we get it there 's no one else about so there 's no need to keep ramming it down our throats by constantly showing roads without cars on them . The zombies are totally wasted , there are two zombie attacks in the entire film & that 's two individual zombies as well although there are a couple of effective nightmare scenes . Night of the Comet pays homage , or rips-off whichever you prefer , several other much better films including the obligatory end of the world shopping spree in a mall lifted from Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) . Forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any . Technically Night of the Comet is pretty good , the special effects are decent enough & the production crew were obviously very good at closing streets off . The acting was alright expect for Maroney as Samantha the air-head blonde who became highly irritating . Night of the Comet was a big disappointment for me , I had hoped for so much more . Persoanlly I found this film dull , boring , uneventful & the puke inducing sequence where the sisters go shopping to the tune of ' Girls Just Wanna Have Fun ' is probably the worst moment in the film . Really bad & I just don't get why so many people like this , I 'm sure I 'll get slaughtered for saying it so let the abuse begin I can take it ..  
  Spoilers . First off , nothing really happened in this movie , other than a woman bleeding inexplicably . Second , it wasn't scary . Third , it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever . Let me elaborate . The sound was edited by either Beavis or Butthead  I 'm not sure which , so let 's just go with Beavis . The movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the people mumble and mutter , forcing you to turn up the volume ( I watched this at home ) . Then Beavis blasts some really loud sounds with supposedly scary / shocking images , forcing you to quickly lower the volume again . This occurs many times until , mercifully , the movie ends . I can picture Beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the two-way mirror while watching the test group franticly reaching for the remote each time . If you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep , this one is a big mistake . But then it 's a big mistake anyway . Here 's a thought  if you 're going to make a horror movie , at least add a gratuitous beheading , a 19-year-old blond girl who screams at the top of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater , the shadow on the wall of someone being eaten alive just out of the camera range , a cat being thrown at the camera to scare the audience , some drifty weirdo with a maniacal laugh , or a monster who looks like a stage hand covered in aluminum foil ( a la TV 's Lost in Space ) . These people didn't even try to scare me . They just wanted to hurt my ears .  
  Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany . Brando 's acting is the ONLY thing that makes this movie watchable . The plot is inane and laughable ( not comic ) . The other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray some modicum of humanity .. these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard . Everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just plain awful . The director throws freeze-frame and slow-motion shots about with impunity . The incidental music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect . It 's not something I really look for in a movie , but even the wardrobe was way off . The venerable Brando couldn't take focus away from the awful rags they had him decked out in . I 've heard this movie called " David Lynch-esquire " and " irreverently funny " .. it is neither . David Lynch films are borne of wicked creativity - this film was in no way creative . And don't confuse irreverence with stupidity .  
  This Charles outing is decent but this is a pretty low-key performance . Marlon Brando stands out . There 's a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland that forgets to develop and it hurts the film a little . I 'm still trying to figure out why Charlie want to change his name . Every movie with " Charles " has been pretty bad .  
  Why Hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime ( The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , The Hills Have Eyes ) but is it considerably worse why Hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that weren't brilliant to start with ( Prom Night , The Amityville Horror ) Much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere , character or any genuine scares at all . Prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch , but for all the wrong reasons . It 's a poorly acted , massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do . It 's clear Hollywood Horror is dead . Even The likes of The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot . Prom night is virtually bloodless and I 'm not even going to mention how bad the plot is . Its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm .. the original . One of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be . Donna Keppel ( Brittany Snow ) has survived a terrible tragedy , but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style . When the big night finally arrives , Donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high-school blowout by living it up and partying till dawn . But while Donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future , the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance . An obsessed killer is on the loose , and he 'll slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only Donna . Who will survive to see graduation day , and what will Donna do when she 's forced to confront her greatest fear ? Scott Porter , Jessica Stroup , and Dana Davis co-star in the slasher remake that will have tuxedo-clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor . A plot that will probably put you off going to see this . Witch if you ask me is a good thing . Without much to work with , McCormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations . At one point , a girl backs into a floor lamp ( a lamp ! ) and McCormick tries to pump it up into a jump-scare moment . Desperate times really do call for desperate measures . There haven't been this many shots of closets since the last IKEA catalogue . In the era of The Hills , My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator , there probably is a freaky , scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and society 's creepy obsession with youthful beauty . This is not that movie . My final verdict ? Avoid at all cost . Nobody will like Prom Night , it 's even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hack-job remakes . Considering its absolute lack of blood or frights . A night you 'll be in a hurry to forget .  
  A spaceship returns from Mars ; about a couple of months earlier , a 4-person expedition had been sent to the red planet . Most of the picture is a flashback to what transpired over there . The picture is saddled by inane , melodramatic dialog , typical of many sci-fi efforts of the fifties & sixties . Note , for example , how the ship 's commander ( Mohr ) tells another crew member to ' stay there ' for no reason ; as if moving to another spot inside the ship will cause a problem . Later , the commander orders two of the crew to remain in the ship while he and another go outside . The two he ordered to stay say ' no way ' and follow out ; I didn't have high hopes for the expedition 's success by this point . There 's much talk of ' ears twitching ' and hugging a freeze-ray gun named ' Cleo ' ( short for Cleopatra , of course ) . It would at least be pretty funny , unintentionally , if the story didn't drag . There 's a very slow pace to the whole thing ; the astronauts spend as much time looking out the ship 's window portals ( which change color from red to blue ) , commenting on what they see , as they do outside actually exploring . The martian landscape , advertised as filmed in ' Cinemagic , ' usually resembles animation cut-outs , or drawings , shot through an orange-red filter to give the illusion of interacting with the actors , who do take on an odd surrealistic appearance due to the process . But I don't think it fools anyone over 10 years old . The one clever mention I did notice was that the memories of the surviving astronaut would be tinged with unreality , so that would explain the unreal nature of the martian vista . Oh , okay .. I was amused by some of the astronauts ' actions as they begin to explore ; right off the bat , they test their freeze gun on a plant , killing it , just for the hell of it . Then the female member hacks with a machete at what she thinks is a tree but turns out to be the leg of the spider-rat monster . Nice going , lady . Look up next time . No wonder the ' intelligence ' on Mars gets upset and doesn't mind that one of the lower lifeforms , a giant amoeba , attacks the explorers . The acting isn't too impressive . Mohr especially , had a very annoying technique , saying a line and then abruptly erupting into a huge grin which always creeped me out - reminded me of It ! the Terror From Beyond Space . The ending is fairly anti-climactic ; don't expect any huge revelations beyond the ' no more expeditions ' with freeze guns named Cleo .  
  This DVD appears to be targetted at someone who will just put it on and play it in an endless loop in the background . It 's organized as a series of music videos of the Grand Canyon set to various pieces of Tangerine Dream music . Unfortunately , the TD music is dull , and the transfer to DVD looks rather blurry and dim . Too expensive a DVD for what it is .  
  The person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writer / director / star-or is , in fact , the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle . How about this ? You want to make a movie-tell a story ; entertain ; draw me in with vivid characters . Sure , you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal . However , do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads . If I 'm to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy .  
  Well , you might not actually SEE any women in love in this movie , but you 'll certainly hear women TALKING about love , and men talking about love , and women talking about men , and men talking about women , and men talking about men , and everyone talking about death , and talking , and talking , until you yourself will want to scream and do something that requires no talking at all , like paint your bedroom or water your plants . Welcome to the world of D.H. Lawrence , where psycho-babble reigns supreme , and where no one can get down to living a productive life because everyone is too busy talking about how unproductive their lives are . Spending time with the characters in a D.H. Lawrence novel is like being locked in a closet with a group of your most self-absorbed acquaintances who you would run away from if you met them at a party . When I read " Women in Love , " I so desperately wanted to strangle every single character in it , but since I couldn't , I was hoping they would at least strangle each other . Alas , only one of them dies , not by strangulation , and I won't spoil it for you by telling which one , in case you actually give a damn about this story or any of these people . To give director Ken Russell his due , he makes this filmed version about as entertaining as it 's possible to make this essentially unfilmable novel . He throws out much of the psychological mumbo-jumbo that Lawrence adored , and focuses instead on all of the naughty parts , so we get lots of histrionic lovemaking in beds and fields , two buck naked men wrestling by firelight , and one embarrassing scene featuring Alan Bates ( yup , buck naked again ) roaming around in a meadow making love to bushes and grass ( I 'm not kidding ) . Glenda Jackson won an Oscar for her performance as Gudrun , the more dominant of the two sisters at the story 's focus , and she certainly tries her hardest to do something with this material ; anyone would deserve an Oscar simply for having to bear Russell 's decision to give her a scene where she has to dance wildly in front of a herd of mystified-looking cattle . Oliver Reed has one expression , an intense glower . The whole thing is over-written and over-directed , and it 's deliriously campy . Indeed , this vies with " Mommie Dearest " as perhaps the most unintentionally hysterical movie I 've ever seen . Grade : D  
  Cash ( Now played by Khrystyne Haje in for Angelina Jolie ) has wandered to a post apocalypse wasteland ( after her protector has died from old age , said protector was played by Elias Koteas , an actual decent actor ) and now she finds that people wander through the rubble looking for cyborgs to trade for scrap metal and cash . She leads a group of burned out cyborgs ( That includes William Katt , Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan ) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch . Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch 's employer . Cyborg 3 does manage to be better than the other two entries but it still is a largely dull feature . The problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well , the action sequences are routine and the name cast such as McDowell , Katt and Galligan are given little to do . Haje is indeed a whiny heroine and Lynch is too over the top ( as usual ) and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as fun-bad as it 's hilarious predecessor . ( The one with Van Damme , the second one is just dull . ) Also disappointing is the science fiction angle which almost aggressively resists any good idea it has . As an action flick this is routine and by the numbers B-movie stuff and it is competently made , that 's the only thing positive I can say about it . * 1/2 out of 4- ( Poor )  
  The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918 . The troops pile off the train - wearing the uniform in which the French Army , including the Legion , marched off to war in 1914 ! This a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey . ( The French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working . Metropolitan French troops were put into " horizon blue " and Colonial troops were put into khaki . ) The Claude Van-Damme ( sp ? ) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right . Really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right .  
  Small college town coed OD 's ? ( Why do we care ? ) Acting sheriff investigates the incident . ( Why do we care ? ) The interviews show us the comatose subject ( Kirshner ) as different as the opinions of the subjects being interviewed . ( Why do we care ? ) Result ? A mess of flashbacks in this mess of a movie featuring a handful of one-hit wonders and B-flick divas which begs the question .. Why do we care ?  
  I 'm afraid that I didn't like this movie very much . Apart from a few saving graces , it 's nothing to write home about . J-horror has boomed for the last five-six years but the films themselves have on more than one account been repetitive and carbon copies of a previous success . This is one of them . Basically this is a supernatural slasher movie . The beginning is promising with chilling scenes from a morgue where a dead girl has her eyes graphically sewn together , but soon after opens them . However , after that , it 's quickly downhill for this flick . To be kind I will start with the things I like about " Gawi " . On the plus side , the visuals are gaudy and the movie looks great for it 's type . For those who like their horror movies gory there are a few nicely executed ( no pun intended ) murder scenes . We also get a few good suspense sequences / set-pieces . However , there are quite a few drawbacks also .. First of all , and my major complaint about this movie , is that the plot skips and jumps forwards and backwards in time with an alarming intensity . Usually that 's not a problem for me , but here , where the students look exactly the same no matter what age they are , I was confused on more than one occasion . The performances are okay I guess ( a little hard to tell when you don't know the language ) , but seem a little stiff . And for a horror movie , I don't think it was scary enough . For a while I was quite bored actually . Being a fan of giallo movies , I was expecting quite a lot from " Nightmare " , but unfortunately I was quite disappointed .  
  Yowza ! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it , you 're a better person than me ! This movie , while a great attempt at ' imitating ' Laurel and Hardy through appearance , sound and routine , falls very short of honoring them , or even being a movie of any substance . I blame Larry Harmon . Dialogue is torn from old L + H movies and planted in unrealistically , the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless co-stars , Pinchot 's accent was bizarre for Stan , and while Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie 's accent , he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was Mr . Hardy . Where was a ( good ) musical number ? Editing is choppy , acting is stiff , lines are horrid , physics are implausable ( although perhaps they were TRYING to give it that feel of cheap sets ? ) , and overall it 's a terrible thing to witness . It 's even more painful to watch than ATOLL K , where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950 's era writing and photography . Do yourself a favor and watch as much of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as you can , and learn how things WERE . You know what a MAGNATE is , don't you ? Stan Laurel did not perpetually reply with semi-moronic quips at every sentence . I pity anyone who thinks that THIS was a decent update / honor of the boys . Where was THE CLASSIC THEME SONG ? ! ? Why ruin ' Here 's another fine mess ' ? Why skip ' any the wiser ' ? Why was there a pointless gaggle of co-stars ? ! WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ ? WHY MUST LARRY HARMON BE IN IT ? WHY BOZO ! ? And did THE LEARNING CHANNEL help fund the thing ? I mean , really . Fart jokes , for God 's sake . FART JOKES .  
  For the life of me I can't figure out why anyone would make a movie like this . The plot is tired , the acting is strained , the language is consistently foul and at times the over use of the " F " word seemed like a lack of dialog was prevalent so ' let 's throw in another couple of " F 's " for good measure , that 's what the American public wants to hear ' . Gossett was particularly foul and seemed to enjoy his part . Forget this c_p , rent ' Shrek " and have a good laugh .  
  Truly shows that hype is not everything . Shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife . Amitabh as always is solid . Ajay Devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke . The leading lady is such a waste of an actor . Such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry . With movies as such I have decreased the amount of bollywood movies I watch . RGV has been making very crappy movies for a while now . Time to get different actors . Hrithek anyone ? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back . Every other leading lady is a half-naked wanna be . Pfft .  
  What 's happening to RGV ? He seems to repeat himself in every movie . Has he run out of creative ideas ? If he has , time to take a back seat . Went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course not once did I imagine it would be anywhere near the original . I knew it wouldn't , the promos said it all . But even then I thought it would be a great RGV treat , after all isn't he the same guy who directed Sathya and Company ? Or is he ? I have my doubts after watching Aag . I am not going to talk about the plot or the story , as most of it is taken from the original , if you are really dying to go and see this one , you could play a fun game with friends : identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own ! So Veeru becomes Heero ( how corny is that ? ) , guess Heeru wouldn't sound that great . Ajay Devgan is quite a disaster as Heero , the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in Company sounds fake . The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo ( Nisha Kothari ) doesn't exists at all . In fact the more charming Nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes . This reaches a peak by the end . Raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others , he is a guy to watch in the future . I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban , he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh . There is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a shawl , instead of inspiring fear he looks like a beggar with his bowl . The only performance that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha . I am afraid I don't have the patience to write more .  
  They should have named this movie .. Blonde women that needed to get their roots colored . Also the main character , geeze , the too tight sweaters . The giggling . Thought the guy did a good job though . I keep hoping we 'll find a good 8 star Christmas movie to watch this week . The dart throwing . Had to laugh at that too . We 've still got 3 more on the DVR to watch , maybe we 'll get lucky . Oh yeah , I figured the guy out pretty quickly and nailed it when he picked up the flowers and then drove out with his cousin . I told my daughter they were on their way to the cemetery . And how stupid was it that the two gals followed them there spying on them ? Creepy .  
  During the first 3 seasons Fairly Odd Parents was as tasty as hard candy , bright and sweet and addictive . Now it 's as tasty as Pepto-Bismol . And unfortunately Pepto-Bismol is what you 'll need after viewing the more recent episodes , where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence resulting in no laughs . Cosmo , once one of the more endearing Nick characters , has devolved into an abusive unfunny cretin that the cast of Family Guy wouldn't even want to know . Timmy has become a selfish arrogant jerkwad that Bart Simpson would happily beat the snot out of ( and given Timmy 's snottiness , that would take a lot of beating ) . And poor Wanda .. a real charmer who 's become the victim of her husband and godchild , she 's now labeled a " nag " for caring about the well-being of others . Plus Cosmo 's stupidity causes pain to everyone else but he 's never punished for it , nor does he learn any lessons . Which pretty much sums up Butch Hartman 's attitude towards kids : they 're crude , vulgar and not too bright . Thank god this crummy toon has been cancelled , along with Butch Hartman 's darling , Danny Phantom . At least Butch got what he deserved - unlike Cosmo .  
  I might not have been the biggest Blair Witch fan but nonetheless appreciated that effort , so I was looking forward to Altered , especially after reading the superlatives thrown around in various IMDb comments . " Unique " , " intelligent " , " A future cult classic " and so on .. you gotta wonder where people come up with that stuff to describe such a poor effort . Because alas , Altered is a poor , weak movie that fails to engage in any and every respect . The silliness is not funny . The horror and gore is not scary . And whatever " thinking " aspect some poor fellows saw in this movie were due to severe delusions because there 's certainly nothing profound or smart about this mess . OK , so we know nothing stands out . Is it at least bearable ? Is the experience worthwhile in any way ? Unfortunately , no . For starters , get very poor acting . It 's not a stretch to say most B-movies these days feature better acting . The plot ? Boring and messy . Dialogs ? Many amateurs actually do better . It 's really the direction that puzzles . I did not expect major improvements over Blair Witch but at least small steps forward . Instead , our director seems to have worsen over time , completely oblivious to previous experiences . If there is a major flaw in Altered , it 's the main set . A major part of the plot takes place in a single location , where the main characters are confined but Sánchez has failed to give the place any personality whatsoever . Considering that in Blair Witch , the forest plays a major part and is as much a character ( an antagonist , if you will ) as the three students , you would think the director would realize the same thing was needed here . But no .. this place has no personality whatsoever thanks to sloppy direction and no attention to details . There 's nothing salvageable here . Die hard fans of " Blair Witch " are better off following Daniel Myrick . Although his output is far from being golden , it shows better structure than Sánchez and some lessons from Blair Witch are applied ( unfortunately , in weak stories but still ) .  
  Manoj Agrawal after the failure of PARDESI BABU ( 1998 ) returned with this film The film has Govinda in 8-9 roles , as his father , mother , grandfather , sister and later-on he also has disguises He in short is a useless detective send on a case by his friend to get proofs against his wife , whose photos he looses at the airport while flirting with Rani He disguises as a Sardarji in the plane and again as a girl The funny part is how easily and in short time he does that ? Then he disguises as a french singer and enters a TV to get proofs lol and then as a maharashtrian ( yes inside the TV itself ) The rest of the film has the same mistaken identities and ends on a predictable note There are some funny scenes like Govinda being bashed by an African and also many other portions Direction by Manoj Agrawal is okay Music is okay Amongst actors Govinda again proves he is one of the most watchable actors He as usual is fantastic though he has done such roles before he fits in all the get ups and roles too well here again though the much hyped 6-7 roles don't actually fit in the film Rani looks fat , teams up well with Govinda thatz it She is nothing great and kept doing such type of roles Amongst rest Nirmal Pandey is as usual Johny Lever is too loud at times and funny in places in 1 role and irritates as the older Tinnu Anand is okay Satish Kaushik is hilarious , Paresh is okay Tanaaz is okay  
  A killer , wearing a plastic white mask and black overcoat , is killing the friends of Hollywood producer Shawn Banning ( Danny Wolske ) who inherited his position when someone sliced open his former employer from crotch to chest . Perhaps the psychopath is newly hired Maddy ( Dabbie Rochon ) , an attractive , raven haired beauty with a troubled family past , plagued with nightmares . Shawn and his friends play a practical joke on Maddy , concerning a supposed Murder Club they started where each member randomly selected a victim to kill . When Maddy accidentally murders a woman in a parking garage because of a dent put into her car by this person , she finds that Shawn 's pals were jerking her chain . But , Shawn and his comrades are concerned about Maddy 's admittance towards committing the murder and contemplate turning her into the proper authorities . Deciding to wait on a definite decision , each member fall prey to the white-masked psycho with Maddy a suspect considering the fact that she already has killed before . Or , is someone else behind these murders ? Low budget slasher , executive produced by Charles Band , with gore murders that fail to convince . Plenty of tits on display and Allen Nabors goofy character Chris might entertain those with low expectations . The murders include a stomach being opened with intestines showing , a neck sliced , an electrical cord thrown into a pool frying a female victim who had all day to escape , an ax buried into the back of a male victim , and , to top it all , a couple are strangled by a rope during their sexual climax ( .. for added effect , the killer uses the breaker bar of a socket wrench as extra leverage to twist the rope as tight as possible snapping their necks ) . There are enough plot holes to drive a truck through , such as why Maddy has nightmares of murders she didn't commit , how she could murder someone so violently ( .. with blood all over her ) winding up waking in her bed without leaving something at the scene of the crime that would easily implicate her , and how Shawn could go so long , allowing her to continue working at the company despite what she told regarding the murder she committed , and a continual desire to join the supposed club that doesn't exist . What bothered me the most was the film 's desire for having us somehow sympathizing with this female protagonist who wanted to join a club after killing someone , later proclaiming it to be an accident . The film builds Maddy as the potential psycho throughout because of her past . Her family disowned her for an abortion . She has black-outs and always appropriately winds up at the scenes of crimes after the fact . In a lot of slashers , the one who seems the most likely killer is often the red herring , but this film goes out of it 's way to point the finger at Maddy . When the twist occurs , we 're left rooting for Maddy , yet we know she 's not right in the head . It 's a tough sell caring for this chick . She does look great in a man 's Army shirt , though . And , Rochon isn't afraid to let her puppies breathe , either . Low budget horror fans will get a kick out of seeing cult favorite Brinke Stevens as a religious fanatical mother who preaches against what Maddy did , calling her a murderer as beloved Troma producer Lloyd Kaufman is the aloof father who can not get in a word edge-wise to protect the daughter he truly cares about . Cult siren Julie Strain has a minor cameo , showing her tits ( of course ) as the opening murdered male 's girlfriend getting her head crushed by a hammer . Oh , and check out the office for which Shawn works , you 'll see a lot of Full Moon posters and art-work spread throughout the walls .  
  You probably heard this phrase when it come to this movie  " Herbie : Fully Loaded with crap " and yes it is true . This movie is really dreadful and totally lame . This got to be the second worst movie Lindsey is ever in since Confession of the Teenage Drama Queen . The only good thing about this movie seem to be the over talent cast which by far is better than the movie million times and is the only selling point of the movie . I don't see how such a respected actor like Matt Dillon could be a part of this movie , isn't he read that horrible screenplay before he sign on to be in it ? What I didn't like about this movie is also base on how Herbie is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and climb on wall and go faster than a racer car after all it just a Beatle . I know it is a kids movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just turn out more silly than entertaining . Little realism is needed plus the story is way too predictable . Final Words : Unless the kids are actually 5 - 12 years I highly doubt that any one could enjoy this senseless movie . What wastage of my money . I feel like cheated . Rating : 3/10 ( Grade : F )  
  As an avid fan of Cary Grant , I expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter , as AMC billed it as a comedy . I have never been more disappointed with a film ! Cary 's usual charm and effortless comedy are AWOL from this entire movie ; he comes across as strained , bored , and just not himself . Mississip 's character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes I have ever witnessed - his accent is terribly exaggerated ( and incorrect , according to which part of Mississippi he claims to hail from ) , and whenever he does deliver a line , it 's several decibels higher than any other cast member . Mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable , country-bumpkin goofball , but in the end , he manages only to detract from the already weak plot . Mansfield looks more like an obscene blow-up doll than a Hollywood sex kitten , and while she was never known in Hollywood for her acting ability , this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with . Ray Walston 's character was sugary and ultimately contrived . For four men on shore leave , it was the tamest leave I 've ever seen . I watched this nightmare until its very end , and while I won't spoil that for anyone , I will tell you that it 's the most absurd you 'll ever see . The film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men , but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast . Sorry , Cary !  
  Ohh the brutality , ohh the dying breed , ohh the sense of loss , ohh the prejudice ! Jeez , when are all you whiney revisionists going to stop analyzing Westerns for crying out loud ? S * t happens . If it offends your socially engineered sensibilities then go back to the comfort of your Meryl Steep collection . Boring , tedious , and very tiresome waste of celluloid-particularly in light of Coburn / Hackman / Bergen 's presence . Nothing interesting or intriguing here , unless you are obsessed with 19th century desert dentisty . May have been a little better without the constant diversion of the out-of-place mexican guy with the bad tooth . A monument to the stupid ultra-left creeping sensitivity of the 60/70 's . Virtually impossible to sit through the entire film . I think I 'd rather have my eyes stapled open for the entire Lucky Luke / Trinity series . 4 Horses / 10-all deader'n hell .  
  French director Jean Rollin isn't exactly known for great films , and this confusing mess is one of the reasons why . One of the most confusing things about this production is the title . For a director who is well known for directing erotic films about lesbian vampires ; you would expect a film with the word ' nude ' in the title to be a particularly bare-breasted one ; but in fact , there 's not a lot of nudity here at all . Instead of erotic lesbian vampires with no clothes on ; we 've got a cumbersome plot about a man who wants to unlock the secret to immortality , a young woman whose affliction might hold the key and a suicide cult , who don't get to do much . The film starts off promisingly with a sequence that sees a young girl carried off by a mysterious bunch of people in masks under the watchful eye of a young French man , who also happens to be the son of a man of importance . Through his investigation , he soon discovers that this woman is not just a normal lady , and as he delves deeper into the cult ; he discovers that cannot be killed by bullets , drinks blood and can't go out in daylight .. sounds like a clear cut case of vampirism to me . Jean Rollin keeps the fantasy atmosphere going throughout the film , but it fails to be interesting because the plot is so badly executed . It is possible to keep up with what 's going on , but only because there 's so many other films that follow similar plots to this one . The director seems to know that he 's messed up the plotting too , as the climax is basically an excuse to explain the film to the audience . There is a twist thrown in at the end also ; but the film would have been better without it . I guess this was Jean Rollin 's attempt to be a little original , but it comes off as a ham-fisted attempt at such , rather than a logical continuation of the story . The cinematography is fairly neat , with lots of the plot taking place in suitably Gothic locations . The girls on board complete what is a pretty picture , and what Rollin 's film lacks in logic and consistency , it somewhat makes up for in style . In the film 's defence , it was made in 1969 ; which somewhat explains the lack of shocks but I can't recommend this movie as it doesn't have much about it that is worth taking note of .  
  This review may contain some SPOILERS . Just when you thought they didn't make them so extremely bad anymore , along comes Rae Dawn Chong as a space vixen and Willie Nelson as a Native American witchdoctor ! It 's even worse when you factor in that these two are the BETTER aspects of ` Starlight , ' a film that should only be viewed for laughs . Chong is an alien sent to Earth to seek out the only remaining half-breed , part man and part alien . Apparently , the Earth is in dire straits . Something is wrong with the genetics of mankind , and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland . Only by duplicating the DNA of the half-breed can the kindly alien race save the planet . Don't ask me how that is , since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution , which is caused by humans . You would think Earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures , not saving them ! Anyway , the half-breed turns out to be Billy Wirth , a man living in a small Southwestern town and is part Native American from his mother 's line , despite the fact that his mother is a red-headed Caucasian and his grandfather is Willie Nelson . Wasn't this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic Carmen Electra bomb ` The Chosen One ' such a howler ? Chong arrives in her ship just as Wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend . Before you can say utter the word ` hogwash , ' Chong is revealing her secret to Wirth , who isn't surprised for a moment , and spreading the word to Wirth 's family . Chong also makes pals with Wirth 's mother , who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years . Well , this is because Wirth 's father was an alien that abandoned her . Of course , he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to Earth for Wirth so he can use Wirth 's DNA to make the people of Earth his slaves . ( Huh ? ) His laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture Wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie . Not only are they boring , but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most . The ideas might be nice on paper , but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity , particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien . But the effects are the bane of the movie . The opening scene involves Chong on her spaceship , communicating with her superior , someone who we do not see but that Chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light . They use no spoken words , but telepathy , so we are treated to subtitles . Trouble is , both Chong and her superior 's subtitles both look alike , and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually ` speaking ' at any given moment , which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish . The spaceship is the worst effect to come out of Hollywood this side of an Ed Wood film . Now , I am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this , but these effects really got to me . The most offensive was the most simple one : a fake night sky . The stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone . Most notably are the moments where Chong tells someone she comes from Pleiades , and we get a shot of the seven stars . Thing is , the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie , but any stargazer knows that Pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations Perseus and Taurus , and the cluster doesn't take up much room in the sky at all . These effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment . Be careful , for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have Willie Nelson turn into a human spotlight and . . . Oh , it has to be seen to be believed ! Starlight , star bright ; Last star I see tonight ; I wish I might , I wish I may ; not have to watch any more of this trash today . Zantara 's score : 1 out of 10 .  
  John Huston 's Wise Blood was a more horrifying misrepresentation of Flannery O'Connor 's book than I could have imagined . From the utterly terrible acting performances ( and don't you , " Oh that was done on purpose , you just don't get it " me ! ) to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of Rockford Files , this film was revolting . I viewed it with no ill-will at the outset , and , in fact , expected a pleasant experience . But the misrepresentation of the southern characters , from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting , comedic way their faith was portrayed , was inexcusable . Right down to it 's end , which was completely devoid of any character sentiment , it failed in every place that O'Connor 's book shined and resonated . The actors portraying the " southern " policemen may as well have been eating smothered hot-dogs from NYC street stands and quoting Godfather . The one redeeming acting performance was Ned Beatty 's lively and dead-on representation of Hoover Shoates , a religious con-artist who hears Moates preaching the Church of Christ Without Christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities . O'Connor 's powerful book is most well-known for it 's creepy , religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of " Faith " . Mr . Huston 's film is a shameful mockery of the author 's intentions , as they are understood by me and most of her fans , if I may be so bold as to say so . While I acknowledge that I can't know exactly what the author wished to convey , I have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan . If I viewed Wise Blood the way Mr . Huston apparently did , I would have thrown it in the trash . For Flannery 's sake , and mine , I forgive you , John Huston . The forgetting .. that will take some time .  
  Probably New Zealands worst Movie ever made The Jokes They are not funny . Used from other movies & just plain corny The acting Is bad even though there is a great cast The story is Uninteresting & Boring Has more cheese then pizza huts cheese lovers pizza kind of like the acting Has been do 1,000 times before I watched this when it came on TV but was so boring could only stand 30 minutes of it . This movie sucks Do not watch it , Watch paint dry instead  
  What a HUGE pile of dung . Shot-on-video ( REALLY crappy camcorder , NOT digital ) pile of garbage . It is without a doubt , the stupidest thing ever made . The fact that this crap was actually released is completely asanine . Everyone who sees it will become stupider for having watched it . Seriously . I felt like it killed several brain cells after I watched this garbage . The positive reviews of this a$crap were obviously made by the " filmmaker " ( and I use the term VERY loosely ) himself and / or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would honestly like this waste of life . Trust me , stay the hell away from this video . You 'll thank me for it . Avoid it like herpes .  
  I watched this film a long time ago ( aprox 10 years or so ) and liked it then . I remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again . The second time around was not pleasant . The acting is ' so , so ' , the plot is illogical , unreasonable and predictable . The acting .. I 'm sure it wasn't a stretch for those actresses to play those characters . The plot .. there 's no way in hell those women would have gotten away with the first robbery much less the 2nd . ( side note : Why did TT not realise that even if she came up with a load of money for her court date they would ask where she got it and she would have no logical answer ! Ding , Ding .. we have a crook ! ) . It horribly stereotyped black women in saying basically that the only way black women can ' beat the system ' or obtain a large amount of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources . It plays too much on sympathy b / c all of them die in the end ( bar Jada ) but it 's not sad ( you 're thinking ' They were so stupid ; they deserve to die ) . You just don't really care about the characters unless you 're a shallow person . I can't believe this film rates over a 5 .  
  I have yesterday seen the second part . And I must say , it was actually better then the first one . At the begin , I realized , It is actually a sequel , not a remake but not a good one . I do not like the old movies and series of Galactica , because the cylons saw like toasters ( just as it was mentioned in this new movie ) and were completely harmless for the old galactica . This movie turns the sides - the Humans were harmless but the whole movie was for me completely chaotic and stupid . Many scenes were unnecessary , for instance the story of the " computer expert " - completely a crap . If I were a scriptwriter I would leave him die in his house , killed by the cylon woman . And the evacuation from the planet ? Oh , please if it would be bombed by 50 Megatons ( why exactly 50 MT ? ) nukes , they would be dead killed by the radiation . And how is it actually possible that the big fleet of cylon was completely hidden before the attack ? Aha , it was possibly this computer virus , created by the cylon - the script was probably written by ten-years-old school boy . The good side of the movie is , that the humans are at last defeated ! Really defeated , the population is near the extinction ( children are dieing - two times explicit in the movie : 1 . a baby ! maybe one month old and a girl in age of max ten - what a violence .. ) . And the bad-asses won and I think it is the first time in such sci-fi galaxy fight movie . I also appreciate the design of the cylons ( not only of the humanoid cylon : - ) a good job with these ships - I like the design of the ships by both of them - human an cylons . The human ships are a good never version of the old ones . And galactica - really pretty with these docks , I liked that . But this is all , only the design is not enough . The acting was really bad , the whole plot was expectable ( only two things not - the human-cylon on the ragnardocks and the human-cylon at the end ) . The dialogs were trivial ( and in the Slovak dabbing just stupid , but that is not fault of the movie ) . The whole movie looked like a pilot film for a series , but who would shoot such series ? What it would be about ? One star for the design the second one for the near extinction of humanity .  
  This is one of the worst movies I saw ! I dunno what are the reasons for shoting suck a crap . Don't waste your time watching this . Good actors , but extremely bad screenplay and dialogues . Hope there 'll be no Blanche 2 : - ) Avoid this movie by all means !  
  * McCabe and Mrs . Miller * takes place in the turn of the century Pacific Northwest . Into a soggy , muddy mining camp John McCabe ( a hirsute Warren Beatty ) comes barging , full of cigar smoke and big ideas about building a proper saloon / whorehouse for the town , replete with a trio of the sorriest whores in movie history . He also comes with an unearned reputation as a gunslinger : too shameful about this to blatantly advertise it , but not exactly afraid to use it in order to assert alpha-male credentials amongst the locals . And thus he wrangles the boys into building his saloon at the rate of 15 cents an hour . It looks to be a rather sorry operation until Mrs . Miller ( Julie Christie ) shows up on a startling contraption that 's half-railroad car , half-automobile ( where did Altman find that thing ? ) . Mrs . Miller immediately takes on McCabe as a business partner , with the aim of classing up the new joint with proper whores and an insistence that all visitors take a bath before entering . Noting that McCabe doesn't know how to add , she also insists on handling the accounts . It 's not clear what McCabe 's function will be . The plot thickens when a pair of oily representatives from the mining company show up in town and offer McCabe to buy him out for five grand . McCabe tells them to buzz off - he 's holding out for fifteen thousand . The company finds negotiation distasteful , so they hire a trio of assassins to simply kill McCabe . . . though how they think they can get away with murdering a man in broad daylight in the center of town is as unclear as McCabe 's function in the whorehouse partnership . ( Excusing this whopping plot hole on the grounds that the locals would be too cowed to talk doesn't cut the mustard when one considers that any reward-money offered by the local Marshal would be pretty tempting . ) * McCabe and Mrs . Miller * , purportedly " classic Seventies cinema " , should be a lot better than it is . The movie tells a pretty good story ; the main characters have the potential to be interesting . There are some striking scenes , especially one involving what looks to be a 14-year-old stone-cold killer . But it 's really , really hard to enjoy a movie when you can hardly hear what anyone is saying and when you can hardly see what anyone is doing . Once again , this director hijacks his own movie with sheer barnyard laziness and sloppiness . According to the trivia-sheet here on IMDb , the movie 's editor griped to Altman that the sound was muddy ; Altman disagreed ; and when everyone said the sound was muddy after the movie 's release , Altman blamed the editor . ( Nice . ) Along with the bad sound , the movie has an atrocious look . Only Robert Altman can hire a world-class DP like Vilmos Zsigmond and make a movie that looks as if they sprayed the camera lenses with dirty dishwater . Reviewers here who praise the " dark brown glow " of this picture have GOT to be kidding me . The interiors are shot through what appears to be a dark scum . The exterior photography is even worse : it 's as if Altman placed 500 fog machines behind the copious trees . During the climactic stretch , when Beatty is dodging the assassins while the local church is on fire , Altman insists on pretty much wholly obscuring the view with an animated snow-fall that reminds one of a Rankin-Bass Christmas special . Look - I can't watch a movie under these conditions . Get back to me when you learn how to place boom mikes , when you remove all that annoying " Altman-esque " overlapping dialog , and when you wipe the lenses with some Windex , or something . 3 stars out of 10 .  
  If you hit your teens in the 70s , as I did , you probably remember the stories about Studio 54 whether or not you liked disco . An exclusive club , it was the perfect symbol of 70s cultural overindulgence and self-absorption ; there 's even an excellent VH1 documentary about the club that could tell you everything you wanted to know about its heyday , and the stories are easily interesting enough to spawn a very captivating film . Sadly , this isn't it . 54 follows the lives of a few of its employees , a bartender named Shane ( Ryan Phillippe ) , a busboy named Greg ( Breckin Meyer ) , his wife , a coat-check girl , Anita ( Selma Hayek ) , and of course the master of ceremonies himself , Steve Rubell ( Mike Meyers ) . While the goings-on at the club are well represented , this film concerns itself more with the personal lives of the workers , following Shane 's story the closest . The movie works in spurts . Sometimes it captures perfectly the shallowness of the nightlife culture ( such as when Shane is taken to a dinner party and doesn't know who ' Errol Flynt ' is ) , and other times it waxes into hokey melodrama . Some of that is inherent in the premise  following the underlings as they mingle in the world of the rich and fabulous  but a lot of it is due to the kid-gloved treatment with which both the club and Rubell are given throughout the movie . While Rubell certainly electrified the scene in New York with his penchant for over-the-top spectacle and his exclusive hand-picking of the crowds each night , the rampant drugs and sexuality are only briefly touched on ; and Rubell himself , while his excesses are mentioned , come off oddly positive for a guy who was in life a liar , a cheat , a drug abuser , and promiscuous as all hell . Not that I was looking for the man to be pilloried here , but his ego directly contributed to the fall of his club and the diminishing of the nightlife culture he helped to elevate . A final scene where he gazes down at the regulars paternally is so emotionally false as to be patently absurd . Meyers does his best to capture Rubell , but he 's given so little to work with here it 's surprising his performance is effective ; but he 's good , and he helps to anchor the film . Philippe , whom I find generally to be a good actor , is hamstrung here by the shallowness and stupidity of his character ; he 's limited to a deer in the headlights smile or a sullen uncomprehending frown , and even he can't translate that into a strong performance . Hayek and Meyer are both okay , again , undercut by the writing , and Neve Campbell  prominently featured on the DVD cover  appears so briefly she really has an extended cameo . For some reason I still find myself interested , even fascinated , by the popular culture of the second half of the seventies . But even given that , this is not a film that particularly engaged me , despite a predisposition to like it . I 'd say if that era , or that club , has any interest for you , track down the VH1 special rather than this middle of the road melodrama .  
  I absolutely despise this movie . No wonder Jose Larraz " disowned " it at one point and refuses to discuss it . I admire Larraz 's work , especially his more obscure slasher / sex maniac thrillers like SAVAGE LUST or SCREAM AND DIE . His work has a kind of inescapable artiness about it that he can't seem to switch off , owing in part to his secondary career as a painter & cartoonist . It 's too bad he never made a Western , his vision would have been perfect . BLACK CANDLES is easily his most notorious film and probably his best known after the masterpiece VAMPYRES . And it 's notoriety revolves around one scene where a Satanic coven enacts a bizarre rite involving extracting the reproductive fluid of a goat - symbolizing The Beast - as some kind of nauseating balm to be used in preparing the waif like sister of a murdered man for her role as the bride of Satan . The scene in question is staged in a way that looks rather convincing even without the display of any plumbing apparatus the goat may have been endowed with , relying upon the histrionics of the actress recruited to play the supplicant in the ritual and lots of guttural chanting on the film 's recycled musical score heard in a half-dozen films attributed to Jacinto Molina . The perverse nature of the scene is more implied than shown in graphic detail , heightened somewhat by the knowledge that said supplicant is actually the teen-aged daughter of the Satanic priest . My but they had fun concocting this movie . The problem with it is that there isn't much to deconstruct or contemplate aside from the paper thin ROSEMARY 'S BABY derived story of a woman being weaned into her role as Satan 's bride by a sophisticated coven of Satanists living in the hedgrowed outlands of a very sinister Britain . Led by Eurohorror sensation Helga Line these Satanists are comprised of doctors , lawyers , land owning magnates and other upper crust dignitaries who actually owe their professional success to their worship of the devil . All you have to do is sell your soul and the world can be yours , only watch out whom you may sell out to pay back petty personal conflict or you may end up being felched with a sword . The film attempts to combine this heady Satanic trip with oodles or borderline graphic sex , and should correctly be regarded as a kind of apex or culmination of the sex and horror Spanish thriller traditions popularized in part by Mr . Molina & Ms . Line , and which had amazingly flourished under the disapproving eye of one Generalissimo Franco , the dictator who controlled Spain up until 1976 . While he lived his decree was that Spanish cinema was to be free of graphic depictions of on-screen sex . Spanish directors often made two versions of their films , one with the sex concealed for their own screens and one with the fornication on display for export . As difficult as it was for the filmmakers to express themselves the result was a sort of interesting tension that usually results when artists flirt with the forbidden : Spanish horror from the 1970s has a very special flavor to it that is somewhat of an acquired taste . It 's not for everyone . But in a bizarre turn of events , without Franco 's influence on their culture Spanish horror sort of dried up in the late 1970s , when their Gothic castles and demonic orgies suddenly found themselves passé when compared to new sensations like JAWS and the STAR WARS phenomenon . And without Franco 's constraints their were suddenly a flood of overtly graphic thrillers that came tumbling out of the pipes in the very late 70s / early 80s , of which BLACK CANDLES is perhaps the best known due to it 's emphasis on sexual deviancy with a barnyard animal . Larraz ' major horror films have always revolved around sexual taboos ( the lesbianism of VAMPYRES , the incest of SCREAM AND DIE & DEVIATION ) but here the effect of the depravity is to overshadow the rest of the production . Nobody cares about anything else but the traditionally censored trip to the Goat Barn , and watching a cut version without the scene in the barn is almost an exercise in pointlessness . The sex isn't graphic enough to rate as porn and the chills aren't chilling enough to rate as horror . So , BLACK CANDLES is essentially a behavior study - Here is how high society British Satanists might behave in their secluded mansions out in the West Midlands or whatever . Between sex scenes the actors / actresses sit around and have lots of discussions . The best thing the film has going for it is an undeniably oppressive atmosphere of claustrophobia , with most of it 's action taking place in the tightly confined interiors of Ms . Line 's character 's mansion . Nearly every avenue of fornication is hinted at so fans of soft-core sex romps with a hinting of supernatural horror will be amused , and of course the vicarious sex criminals amongst us will enjoy choking their chickens to the goat barn scene . But the ultimate conclusion of the film is silly , pretentious , intelligence insulting , and probably perfect for such an otherwise forgettable exercise in applied sleaze . 2/10 ; Without the Goat Barn this movie just isn't the same , and with the scene it 's probably a bit too much for most viewers . Larraz was correct to disown it .  
  This movie was absolutely pathetic . A pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes . At times I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead . I couldn't even sit through the whole movie . Emran Hashmi disappoints , and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all . Celina Jaitley was not bad . The only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on Anu Malik and his obsession of shayaris . It was pretty hilarious . The songs " Sini Ne " and its remix version were really good . You can always count on Emran lip-locking and lip-synching a chartbuster . All in all , it seems Emran doesn't have a good script from the Bhatts to back him up this time .  
  A sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life : one as a " happily " married man with a ten year oldish child , the other as a sex fiend . The bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist , listening to his story and intelligently probing him . Nastassja 's role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes . If she had , I would have rated this movie a big fat " F . " As it is , it rates an F + , implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored . It is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage . " Diary of a Sex Addict " falls into the category of films that once one has seen it , one wishes that one hadn't .  
  This is the worst adaption of a classic story I have ever seen . They needlessly modernize it and some points are actually just sick . The songs rarely move along the story . They seem to be thrown in at random . The flying scene with Marley is pointless and ludicrous . It 's not only one of the worst movies I 've seen , but it is definitely the worst musical I 've ever seen . It 's probably only considered a classic because " A Christmas Carol " is such a classic story . Just because the original story was a classic doesn't mean that some cheap adaption is .  
  The plot of 7EVENTY 5IVE involves college kids who play a cruel phone game that unexpectedly ( to them , if not to fans of horror ) gets them in over their heads . The STORY of 7EVENTY 5IVE , on the other hand , is that of a horror film that had a wee little bit of promise , sadly outweighed by really bad writing . What could have been a fun , if somewhat silly , old-fashioned slasher tale is derailed early on by its filmmakers ' misguided belief that the audience would enjoy watching a bunch of loud , whiny rich kids bitching at each other for most of the film 's running time . With the exception of a police detective played by Rutger Hauer , ( in a minor role that is designed mainly to add the movie 's only star power ) every character on screen is a different breed of young A-hole . Male and female , black and white , straight and gay , an entire ensemble of shallow and shrill college kids carries the bulk of the film 's narrative . Worse , since the tale deals with a PARTY game gone awry , most of the time the scenes are completely filled with these little b * ds . Because of this , there are few breaks for the viewer , who must put up with the angry sniping of the thinly-drawn protagonists . Even though at least some of these people are supposedly friends , invariably all characters interact in a very hostile manner , long before any genuine conflict has actually arisen . This leads to the worst possible result in a slasher film : The audience , intended to care about the leads , instead not only cheers on the anonymous killer , but wishes that he had arrived to start picking off the vacuous brats far earlier . The real shame of this poor characterization is that otherwise 7EVENTY 5IVE actually DID have some potential . Visually it 's fine . First-time directors Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor know how to build a suspenseful mood . They also manage to deliver on some competent , if sparse , moments of classic 80s-style gore . Surprisingly , the production 's cast is also fairly able . It isn't that the actors aren't capable of expressing realistic human emotion ; it is simply that the screenplay ( co-written by newcomer Vashon Nutt and director Hooks , who fared much better behind the camera than with a keyboard ) is short of such moments . 7EVENTY 5IVE can hardly be recommended , as its familiar premise and few thrills can't outweigh the bad taste left behind by a story driven by a gaggle of unpleasant characters . In this tepid whodunnit , the real mystery is why anyone should care about a group of young folk who can't even manage to like each other .  
  I saw this at an arty cinema that was also showing " Last Days " and some Charlie Chaplin films . Based on the quality of the other features , I decided to give " Immortel " a chance . I nearly walked out of this movie , and I LIKE science-fiction ! The story is set in a futuristic New York city , filled with Blade Runner-style sky advertisements and some similar debates about cloning / synthetic humans . Unfortunately , the screenplay was not condensed enough for an hour and forty five minute movie . Three groups exist in this world : humans , artificial humans , and Egyptian gods . The artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city . The humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation . The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid ( modeled on the Great Pyramid of Khufu , and complete with a deteriorated exterior , leaving a smooth " cap " on the pyramid . Wouldn't a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition ? ) . The pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it 's there . I won't bore you with the so-called plot , but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many gross-out scenes . The film , as I said , looks to have been influenced by Blade Runner , and perhaps also by The Fifth Element and The Matrix . At the end of the film credits were listed thank-yous to the United Kingdom , France , and Italy . The film is FRENCH , but uses British actors who don't speak French . Hence , it is obvious that their French dialog has been dubbed . This is a distraction , and I also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations quite distracting . It doesn't help that the animations are poor-no better than a video game . Skip this one .  
  Not even Bob Hope , escorted by a raft of fine character actors , can save this poorly written attempt at wartime comedy , as his patented timing has little which which to work . The plot involves a Hollywood film star named Don Bolton ( Hope ) , and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of World War II , followed by his enlistment by mistake in a confused attempt to court a colonel 's daughter ( Dorothy Lamour ) . Bolton 's agent , played by Lynne Overman , and his assistant , portrayed by Eddie Bracken , enlist with him and the three are involved in various escapades regarding training exercises , filmed in the Malibu , California , hills . Paramount budgeted handsomely for this effort , employing some of its top specialists , but direction by the usually reliable David Butler was flaccid , and this must be attributed to a missing comedic element in the scenario . A shift toward the end of the film to create an opportunity for heroism by Bolton is still-born with poor stunt work and camera action in evidence . Oddly , Lynne Overman is given the best lines and this veteran master of the sneer does very well by them . Dorothy Lamour looks lovely and acts nicely , as well , and it is ever a delight to see and hear Clarence Kolb , as her father , whose voice is unique on screen or radio , but there is little they can do to save this film , cursed as it is with an error in script assignment .  
  When his in-laws are viciously murdered by a gang of thugs , a young deputy is ordered to escort his mute friend , forced to take the rap by the gang , to Tucson for trial and ending up having to face the real killers along the way . The Decoy is a real-life decoy sent to video stores to lure you away from better films ! It 's talky , illogical , slow , and ultimately very boring . There 's some good costumes , sets , and photography but nothing else is good about this vanity project from writer / director / producer / star Justin Kreinbrink , who apparently had too much money on his hands . They used to make westerns like this , that were under an hour long . Trim this of about half it 's length and you might have something watchable .  
  I am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators . To me it was rather a disappointment , especially the combination of historical facts , fantasy and the main character 's internal turmoil does not work at all ( in Vonnegut 's book Slaughterhouse Five and even in George Roy Hill 's adaptation for the screen it does ) . Credibility is often overstretched . Too many questions are left open . Did I miss some central points ? Or did I fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots ? A boy called Campbell , Jr . , grows up in upstate New York . At home his father has many technical trade papers and one book . It has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it . The boy leafs through the book , his dad doesn't like his doing that . What should this tell me ? The family moves away from upstate New York to Berlin . BANG . It is 1938 , the boy is a married man in Berlin and a theater playwright . What kind of plays does he write ? In what language ? Is he successful ? His wife is an actress and looks glamorous . The parents move back to the USA and invite their son to do the same . He does not . Why ? Because having grown up in Germany he feels more German than American ? Because he is successful ? Because his wife is ? Because he likes his life there ? Because he likes the Nazis ? Because he is just plain lazy and doesn't like change ? Don't ask me . Possibly , the man just does not care , is not interested in politics , is a kind of an existentialist . He states that he is deeply in love with his wife . He speaks of his Republic of Two ( meaning he and his wife ) . There is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie , it much more seems a Republic of One . On the request of an American agent Campbell , Jr . , agrees to broadcast anti Semitic Nazi hate propaganda to American listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to American authorities who read between the lines . The crucial meeting with the agent on a Berlin park bench is short , unexciting and anti climactic , the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation , the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast . So now we have Campbell , Jr . , presenting himself over the air as the Last Free American . The scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting - although one wonders what happened when Campbell , Jr . , really and honestly had to cough , hiccup etc . ( must have scrambled the messages terribly ) . Anyway , the Nazis lose , the wife dies ( touring in the Crimean for German troops - I never heard such tours really happened on German front lines in WW II ) , Campbell , Jr . , says he goes to the Russian front but does not go , is captured by an American soldier who recognizes his mug ( how come ? ) , is dragged to a sight-seeing tour in Auschwitz , is then released and resettled with the help of the Crucial Agent somewhere in the City of New York . AND THIS IS WHERE THE STORY REALLY STARTS BANG . From now on it is like a short story by Paul Auster . It is 1961 , Campbell , Jr . , lives in New York tenement as a has-been and mourns the loss of his wife . Nobody really cares - or do they ? Yes , somehow they do , and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction . Auschwitz survivors . A painter . Some American supremacists discover " him and want him to be their figurehead . They even find his presumed dead wife for him , or is she his wife ? Anyway , in the end Campbell , Jr . , calls in at the Israeli consulate , and they obligingly give him the Big War Criminal treatment , placing him in the cell adjacent to Adolf Eichmann 's . He writes his life story and , once this task finished , hangs himself on the typewriter 's ribbons without getting sooty the least bit . While I can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss , I just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone . So I found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss . Amazingly , many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero , having put his reputation at stake for playing the Last Free American . I assume according to them this took a lot of courage . As a matter of fact , however , the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment Campbell created for himself a win-win situation , as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war . The danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story . One might argue , that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything . But even then it fails to make a point , primarily , I suspect , because the love affair in the Republic of Two falls completely flat . This is a pity , especially if you consider that the wife was played by Sheryl Lee , a talented , versatile and sensuous actress . She has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous German accent . Another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts ( confession , broadcast and hidden messages ) , but I guess this is largely unfilmable . Maybe I should give the book a chance .  
  " National Lampoon Goes to the Movies " ( 1981 ) is absolutely the worst movie ever made , surpassing even the witless " Plan 9 from Outer Space . " The Lampoon film unreels in three separate and unconnected vignettes , each featuring different performers . The only common thread is the total lack of any redeeming qualities . Well , maybe there is one . Another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice , and he 's right . Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash their assets prettily , in part one and part two , respectively . But their glamorous displays are , alas , wasted . The directors seem to have forgotten that even T & A needs a credible story to surround it , and there 's none in sight . The third segment , starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark , is the most disgusting of the three , and an unfortunate choice as the windup of this film . Benson plays an eager-beaver young policeman , brightly reporting for his first day of duty , ready to rid the streets of evil . He is paired with an old , cynical cop played by Widmark , and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first patrol together , we sense a possible redemption of the film 's earlier failures . Maybe , just maybe , the cynical old-timer will be reformed by his new partner 's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty . Maybe all will end happily after all . But alas , this movie heads straight for the toilet , with no redemption , no happy ending , no coherent story of any kind . Before " National Lampoon Goes to the Movies , " I thought I had already seen the worst schlock that Hollywood could possibly turn out . Unfortunately , I hadn't seen the half of it .  
  When I saw the previews for this movie , I didn't expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie . But wow , this movie was absolutely awful . And that 's being generous . First of all , the casting for the movie was terrible . You feel no sympathy ( or for that matter any morbid feeling ) for the characters . The acting was so terrible that I was just simply waiting and hoping for the God-awful thing to end . Secondly , there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever . Can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming " PANCAKES ! " at the top of his lungs while going into Jackie Chan moves I 've never seen before , and even further biting the guy who has the virus ? Why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus-infected guy , and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him ? I was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that I literally said out loud , " Where the hell did that come from ? " I just simply couldn't believe what I had seen . I really thought I had seen some bad movies , but I have to say that Cabin Fever tops them all . This movie made me want to puke and then puke again . Then blow my brains out . Please , save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive . Watching grass grow , perhaps , is a proper alternative .  
  This is a depressingly shallow , naive and mostly unfunny look at a wildly improbable relationship between Brooks ' psychotic film editor and Harold , his vapid girlfriend . The two have ZERO chemistry together - primarily because Harold is incapable of doing anything besides looking pretty at this stage of her career ; but also because Brooks ' character is neither interesting nor likeable . There are 15 static , excruciating minutes at the beginning where Brooks , having just broke up with Harold , stumbles about his apartment in a depressed , drugged out state - unbearable . Sappily and unimaginatively bookended by Joe Cocker 's " You Are So Beautiful " , there simply is not enough material here for a feature film . There is hardly anything going on on the periphery of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world . I 'm sure Brooks ' intention was to shine a white hot spotlight on the affair and , in a way , deconstruct it ; but if you 're going to do that the writing and acting needs to be far far better than what it is here .  
  Despite pretty bad reviews , I just had to give this film a go  it does , after all , star HK super-babe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cat-burglars . Surely that 's worth checking out ? Well , as babe-fests go , Martial Angels is hard to beat . The eye candy is top quality . Shu Qi looks as fantastic as always , and of the rest of the girls , Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang caught my roving eye in particular . Unfortunately , if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits , it is an absolute stinker ! The story is weak , the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic . Director Clarence Fok and Producer Wong Jing have given us a photogenic cast and little else . If Shu Qi is the only reason you 're contemplating seeing this one , you would be better off watching Sex and Zen 2 again !  
  I 'm so confused . I 've been a huge Seagal fan for 25 years . I 've seen all of his films , and many of those dozens of times . I can only describe this film as " bizarre . " Steven Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film , but I have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines , with a thin , whiny imposter 's voice no less . What I also don't get is , if they had to dub SOME of his lines , why does his own voice appear on the rest of them ? I expect Seagal to age like the rest of us . But the Seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger , confidence , bravado , charm , and sex-appeal he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous movies . What I found myself missing most of all was his cocky , self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin . Where is that in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star ? I hope that this film is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so , his lifelong fans will have to concede that the Seagal we all knew and loved is gone .  
  STAR RATING : * Saturday Night * Friday Night * Friday Morning * Sunday Night * Monday Morning Marshall Lawson ( Steven Seagal ) is assigned to France on a reconaissance mission along with three new young strike-team recruits after disobeying a direct order from above . However the night before they 're due to strike , they are all found grusomely slaughtered by a killer with seemingly inhuman strength . With the French police dallying around with their own investigation , he goes in search of those responsible himself , only to uncover a corrupt faction of the military dealing in a deadly new drug that alters a person 's DNA and gives them terrifying new strength . Bad cover . Bad title . Bad post-production tampering . And bad trailer . Pretty bad film . But , I 've got to say , I don't think Attack Force is quite his worst . I know this will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here ( perhaps not Steveday ! ) but I think a lot of the criticism has stemmed from all the bad news that went before the film rather than the actual quality of it itself . I must say there was nowhere near as much dubbing or ropey editing as I 'd been lead to believe . The dubbing there was ( which made him sound like Martin Sheen with a groin problem ! ) was pretty awful and quite frequent but not in use for as large a segment of the film as I 'd thought . The plot flowed pretty smoothly as well considering all the messing about with the original finished film called Harvester that went on . Also as another reviewer noted , the film has a nice Gothic look to it , a new touch for a Seagal film . The absolute killer low point , though , was the complete and total lack of any exciting action , with only a few poorly filmed fight scenes for any fun . I have to be honest , though , I would rather watch this again than Flight of Fury , Today You Die or Out for a Kill . *  
  I 've seen this film several times in a variety of short-film festivals and it always causes me the impression that i have seen a movie trailer ! For a school-film is very well produced and directed , but the story .. well it needed something else to be a bigger and interesting film . The character named Tim Watcher needed some in-dept approach . This is something that lacks in some Portuguese short films - the script is always superficial . But still .. i liked this movie .. Parabens ! ( congratulations ! )  
  This was not the worst movie I 've ever seen , but that 's about as much as can be said about it . It starts off with some good atmosphere ; the hospital is suitably sterile and alienating , the mood is set to " eerie " . And then .. nothing . Well , somethings . Just somethings that clearly don't fit in .. and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre and yet not particularly intimidating critters , and the hospital they 've taken over . I mean , come on , biker duds ? Some band watched a bit too much Gwar . My personal favorite was the head demon , who looks rather a lot like a middle-aged trucker desperately attempting menace , while simultaneously looking like he 'd really like prefer to sag down on an afghan-covered couch , undo his belt , pop a can of cheap beer ( probably Schlitz ) , and watch the game . Honestly , I 've seen far scarier truckers . At truckstops . Drinking coffee . WWwoohHHoo ! Scary ! The other monsters are even more cartoonish , and even less scary . At least , on the DVD , the videos give some explanation of their presence in the hospital .. they apparently just randomly pop up in places , play some bippy " metal " , and cause people to be dead a bit . Barring a few good special effects , and acting that is not entirely terrible given a lack of decent writing , there 's just nothing here . It 's a background-noise movie only .  
  a romance without feeling , a drama of issues without point ( or drama ) .. This film is supposed to be all these and fails on each and every account , as if it isn't trying . Or as if the director / editor / scriptwriter team isn't really trying . The actors are able-they need better support . One element that doesn't fail is the score by George Delarue . Beautiful and moving . What a shame it 's attached to this film . In a good film actors ' words and movements and music synchronize and enhance the impact . This editor plastered on music with no regard for dialogue and movement . The love scene is particularly grating in this respect : an insult to the talents of the lead actors . There is another element in the film that works : location photography . Notably one moment in Grand Central Station . I 'd guessed in advance what was going to happen ; but how it was filmed in that setting was breathtaking . Some commentators on this board have pointed out that US assimilation of criminal Nazi scientists actually happened during these years of the MacCarthy scare . The moment the film seems to start looking seriously at American society , it switches into conventional romance ; before any human feelings can move us , it 's away on a ( predictable ) ' thriller ' escapade . Just as the film insults the talents of the actors , it insults the issues it 's pretends ( and fails ) to take up . You are warned .  
  There 's really not a lot to say about Las Vegas Lady . It 's harmless enough , but it is little more than a dull heist film from the 70s . The movie is neither as clever nor as sexy as it strives to be . The plot is a retread of the tired old casino robbery storyline that 's been done to death . Except in the case of Las Vegas Lady , I think the robbery plot was designed by a 3 year-old . The plan involves three women  one to unnecessarily and in plain view scale the outside of the Circus Cicus building , one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity , and one to stand around exposing her cleavage . That 's pretty much it . Intricate , huh ? Other than Stella Stevens and her aforementioned breasts , the other women involved in the plot aren't particularly memorable . Las Vegas Lady co-stars Stuart Whitman . When not pawing Stevens , his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun fights ever put on film . I really wanted to like this movie . It does have that 70s feel to it that I always enjoy and some nice shots of Las Vegas circa 1975 . But the movie itself is too dull to rate any higher than a 4/10  and that 's probably overstating it . In the end , Las Vegas Lady is a waste of some perfectly good cleavage .  
  To quote the film , " It 's better not to know . Better still to forget . Best of all to be abandoned . " Oh , the irony . A ghost story with all the technical refinements of a Hollywood horror film , but horrifyingly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the film , and you feel like you 're being preached to from the start . It 's as if the writers ' cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by bad cop TV and a Jerry Springer show . Fitting , maybe , for a film like The Hitcher , not a Russia-set horror film . The result is that a potentially great setting and some potentially great gore scenes go to waste and become just silly , not scary or meaningful .  
  We all know what 's like when we have a bad day at the office , right ? Well , this Neil Simon comedy looks at what it 's like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office . Sometimes , it 's just not worth going , know what I mean ? And , sometimes , it 's just not worth doing something when it 's already been done before , in 1970 , with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis .. and much better also . It 's not that Steve Martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the harried and stressed advertising exec ; quite to the contrary , on both counts . And , it 's not that Goldie Hawn is equally inept either ; her work has been consistently good , if not great , ever since I first saw her in TV 's Rowan and Martin 's Laugh-In of the 1960s . The problem with this movie is that it 's not about the hapless couple at all : it 's really about New York and why everybody should come to New York to live and love their lives away in married bliss  sort of  in the greatest city in the world . That 's if you 're a New Yorker .. Look , the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere , and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment . This 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess . For example , not content with the star appeal of the main players , there is a cameo ( relatively long also ) from Rudy Giuliani , then mayor of New York , as we all know . What  Giuliani bucking for President even then ? Worse  a walking talking advertisement for the kinder face of New York . And then we have John Cleese , reprising his role as Basil Fawlty  but this time , as a prancing cross-dresser also  once again browbeating hotel staff , sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is , in this role . And , in the process , doing great damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers , arguably the best British comedy series , bar none .. Why was this 1999 movie made ? In the 1970s , New York was a dying city , in many ways . It was almost literally bankrupt . So , when made in 1970 , that was the city you saw : grim , dark , moody , unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the Big Smoke ( as it was then , polluted and all ) . By 1999 , things had gotten better : glitz was back , New York was thriving , it was the Big Apple , ready for you to bite into , if you had the moxie .. So , naturally , the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the American dream of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . Hence , this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged . As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in comedy , this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great Jack Lemmon . If you 've seen the latter , then definitely don't bother with this one .  
  I 'd like to start off by saying that I am NOT an anime fan ( with a few notable exceptions ) , and I generally have a low opinion of so-called otakus , as they are so in love with their particular brand of cartooning that they label every movie starring spiky-haired , big-eyed characters as a work of art without even considering other more vital factors , such as the plot . And no anime movie better represents this division between otakus and people with actual taste than this elegant piece of trash , Fatal Fury : the Motion Picture . As seen through the glassy , witless eyes of an otaku , there 's little to find fault with in Fatal Fury - there 's plenty of quirky Japanese-y humor , one-on-one duels , some " dramatic " moments , and everything is beautifully drawn . But everyone else will be turned off by the cliched , predictable plot with cliched , predictable characters , culminating in a cliched , predictable ending . The love scenes are hilariously overblown - the scene in which Sulia " heals " Terry is obviously intended to be a tender moment , but it 's virtually impossible to not be thrown into spirals of giddy laughter by the sheer ludicrousness of it . And of course , Fatal Fury is not without the obligatory cartoon T & A- this is supplied gratuitously by the huge-breasted Mai Shiranui . And since Fatal Fury IS based off the video game series of the same name ( oh boy ) , we 're treated to numerous pointless cameo appearances by popular characters with little or no relevance to the plot whatsoever ( they go through all the trouble of introducing Kim early on , only for him to disappear from the movie totally after that point ) . This mess of a movie reaches its climax with the unintentionally farcical final battle , in which all the main characters engage the all-powerful main villain in one-on-one combat in turn . That 's some thing that 's always amused me .. even when battles in animes AREN'T taking place in a tournament , they always happen as if they were , regardless of the fact that it makes no sense whatsoever ! Otakus always rave about how anime movies should be treated as MOVIES as opposed to merely cartoons , and a disturbing portion of those same people love Fatal Fury . So would Fatal Fury have been good if it wasn't an anime ? The answer is an emphatic " no " - all of this movie 's charm , what little of it there is , resides in the actual drawings . Had Fatal Fury not been an anime , it would have been worthy of an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 , if the show was still on the air . That 's the key - this is nothing more than a laughably bad B-movie in the guise of an anime epic . If you 're a fan of movies so bad that they 're actually entertaining , consider renting Fatal Fury ( or catch it on the Sci-Fi channel ) , as it is definitely one of those . If you 're an otaku , please WAKE UP and realize that a good 90 % of the stuff you 're watching is garbage . As for everyone else , buy a Dreamcast and Fatal Fury : Mark of the Wolves , but don't even consider seeing this movie .  
  This movie is suppose to be a mysterious , serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl . However , 30 minutes into the movie , it turns into a funny , unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes . I can't imagine anyone not laughing when Cage randomly Karate kicks that blonde girl or when he " bear " punches that old lady . The lines , characters , and acting are all poorly done from the get-go . I 've always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor , but he has made some terrible movies this year ; this being by far the worst one ( yet .. ) . I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense story-gripping thriller . If you really want to enjoy this story , go rent the original . However , if you intend on watching it , get ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously ; that 's the only way you enjoy this film .  
  me , my boyfriend , and our friend watched this " movie " if thats what u wanna call it , and we agree with the last person , but we were stupid and bought the damn thing , we thought it really was about diablo so we bought it . we hate it Really SUXZ ! so beware : DO NOT BUY THIS THING THEY CALL A MOVIE ! we would return it , but don't no if anybody would want this stupid movie . oh and another thing , the shouldn't call it " The Legend of Diablo " they should of called it " Legend of Azar " . and this movie is rated R ? this should not of even been not rated . we think that diablo would be crying his eyes out laughing at this stupid movie . this is a movie that would have been done by a Church . theses " actors " are never gonna become nothing because this movie .  
  This could have been a very good film , if I had been able to watch it . The hand held camera was very bouncy . From the opening credits I was worried . Several of us watching it felt very nauseous by the end . But we did stay until the end because it was such a charming and interesting film , giving some insight to the young pop culture in South Africa . The black and white film did enhance the artful feeling of it . The acting seemed very authentic . Some of the dialog was a little hard to understand , but a theater full of non-South Africans seemed to find most of it funny . If you get motion sickness at all though , you may seriously consider skipping this film . It 's quaint , but not worth the nausea .  
  Joyce Reynolds seems a might grown-up for the role of Janie , a boy-crazy sixteen-year old in small town America who ditches her steady guy for a visiting soldier AND winds up on the cover of Life magazine ( smooching at a blanket party ) all in the same week ! Non-stop barrage of wisecracks , put-downs , bull talk , and unfunny bits of business such as Janie 's little sister bribing family members , Hattie McDaniel ( as the maid ) constantly scuttling after sassy kid sis , Janie 's mother involved with the Red Cross , and Janie 's father trying to write an editorial on the problems with today 's teenagers ( as the parents , stuffy , sexless Edward Arnold and pert , chatty Ann Harding make an unlikely couple , even for 1944 ; he looks incapable of helping to conceive a child much less raising two of them ) . Nominated for an Academy Award ( ! ) for Owen Marks ' editing , Warner Bros . followed this in 1946 with " Janie Gets Married " . Reynolds must have outgrown her co-horts by then-she was replaced by Joan Leslie . * 1/2 from *  
  Whenever a Columbo story deviates from the familiar plot ( colorful killer commits crime , Columbo smokes out killer , Columbo becomes a pest in the process ) , the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes . This episode deviates in the extreme , and the result is a major flop . Would you believe : Columbo never faces the villain till the very end ? ! Frankly , I was tempted to turn it off about two-thirds through . Oh , the sacrifices we self-appointed reviewers make !  
  True , there are many movies much worse then this movie . This movie was no Manos : The Hands of Fate , or Troll 2 ( yes , I have seen them both .. twice ) but at the same time this movie is No Alien , Predator or even Alien Vs . Predator ( Yes , even that movie surpassed this ) . Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like a Star Wars it is so bad . Razzie awards lookout , your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters . This film I 'm talking about is of course Alone in the Dark . I 'll try to take you though a step by step process on why this film was so bad . Acting - I 'll first start off with what perhaps was the best component of this film ( next to the ending credits , which played ' Wish I had An Angel ' , the acting . Christian Slater must be proud of himself , he successfully proved that it is possible to act decent in a film worse then drinking antifreeze . Though all his awful dialog he had to speak , it made me wonder why he just didn't walk off the set halfway . Perhaps it was because of Stephen Dorff being in the film as well ( somebody he wishes he could be but fails at it ) . Tara Reid is a bad actress but good looking and that 's all that really matters in films like these . That is not to say the acting was perfect though , it was average , not good , and perhaps the only thing in the film not good . The Soundtrack - Except for ' Wish I had An Angel ' , the soundtrack is pointless and bad heavy medal being pumped into the viewers ears , perhaps to disguise the awful story ( something I will get to soon ) . A long and very expensive 2 CD soundtrack is now up for sale for those musically challenged . The Directing - Directed by Hollywoods favorite director Uwe Ball who brought us the classic House of the Dead . Telling us " Yes , movies can get this utterly bad and that 's just the beginning to my deadly saga of awful movies " . At least it is said to be directed by Uwe Ball . Without being told I would have guessed a monkey was kidnapped from the Congo , brought here and forced to make opinions on how to make the movie under penalty of being shocked . The director of photography was probably a camcorder taped onto a skateboard and pushed forward until it hits a wall . On the scenes where the camera should stay still it is constantly moving , not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should be moving in action , the camera stops for some reason . The Producing - Who on earth is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb ? I pity the fool .. sometimes . Sometimes I 'm glad he or she was taught such a lesson to never put money towards garbage worse then dog dung tied up in a bag . The Writing / Storyboard - Trying to Analise the story is more painful then jamming an ice pick under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as I possibly could with it right after but I will still attempt it . Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children where to go under science experiments . He escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted ( this is the point where it got so bad i started to laugh out loud ) . Then it fast-forwards many years later where he 's a paranoia detective . He get 's attacked by some zombie that can't be shot to death , kills it and moves on with life . Later on he gets attacked by some crazy looking monster and he discovers secrets that nobody else knows . Yeah , the plot is bad , really really bad . The film beings with expecting us to read approximately 10 minutes , which felt like 100 , of random text about an untrue civilization called the Abskani . The film goes not to have one twist after another , more then the audience can handle , more then the audience wants to handle , more then the audience could ever care about . This storyline is rock bottom bad that even Double Dragon does better . Overall , miss out on this movie . I gave it a 1 out of 10 but that is because there is no 0 .  
  There are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flick 's abundance of clichés throughout - and I agree completely , both with regard to the characters AND the dialog . I 'd read about Elizabeth Berkly 's awful performance in the equally-awful " Showgirls , " which I 've never seen - and her performance here , while not awful , is barely up to the standards of Lifetime 's worse fare . There was not a hint of depth to her character , but then there probably shouldn't have been . If so , it would have placed the film completely out-of-balance , since there wasn't a hint of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any one character , performer , or portrayal . The principal 's handling of Liz 's initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable . Her husband 's initial reaction and advice were likewise ( Forrest Gump , attacking Jenny 's boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic , intelligent action , and , hell , he was mentally-challenged ) . The smarmy , unctuous lawyer ( excuse the redundancy ) father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance : he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time , no mean feat . Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd , also not unknown in the profession . Finally ( and frankly , I rather enjoyed this part ) , the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs , that you 'd rather depend upon Barney Fife , without Andy , to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community . I know that most real-like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness , intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the " Law and Order " series ' , and the like - but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on " Lifetime . " Finally , I found a kind of " story within a story " fascination with Josh 's concoction of his being the " victim " of his teacher . This scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story . This was something of an achievement , like going from " F " to " F-minus . " This whole lame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minutes , following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities , with husband involved . But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following , and left an hour 's blank film in the camera . But the writer ( s ) here , proved with their ending , they could do even worse . When the situation was finally " resolved " and " righted , " this was accomplished in all of about 45 seconds , with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any " real world " context for the perpetrator and his parents , or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption . This one 's a 2 * presentation ; the second " * " because it does have some mild " fascination . "  
  The stranger Jack ( Matthew Lillard ) arrives in the studio of the crook collector of antiques Max ( Vincent D'Onofrio ) and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons Jamie ( Valeria Golino ) that he is Jack 's brother . Jamie does not buy his story , dominates Jack and ties him up to a chair . When Max arrives , Jack proposes US $ 100,000.00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques " Spanish Judges " with a wealthy and dangerous collector . Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece ( Mark Boone Junior ) , who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from Mars , to compose the backup team . However , Jack double-crosses the collector and then he intrigues Jack , Jamie and Piece . The low budget " Spanish Judges " is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast . Valeria Golino is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor Vincent D'Onofrio , they are not able to save the stupid story . Further , the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work , and actually they are silly and not funny . My vote is three . Title ( Brazil ) : " Tudo Por Dinheiro " ( " All For Money " )  
  When I heard the plot for this movie I simply had to see it , I mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes ! Sadly the title is about as funny as it gets . Led by Detective Dick Mason , a special team of military and scientists ( including Greg Colburn who never takes his SCUBA outfit off and Lt . Finletter who is never pictured without his parachute trailing behind ) ' Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes ' is a parody of B-Movies , in particular Japanese horror of the 1950 's . The film begins with a standard sized tomato being discovered by a women washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady , and let me tell you it doesn't get any saner as the film progresses ! To be fair there are a couple of funny moments , for instance anytime the Japanese scientist Dr Nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an American accent , or when disguise expert Sam Smith infiltrates the tomatoes ' hey , can somebody please pass the ketchup ? ' . Equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept . Unfortunately for ' Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes ' spoof films such as the ' Airplane ' and ' Naked Gun ' series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better since . The acting is atrocious ; there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy . For a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once , one gag after the over . The singing in the film seems pointless and the adverts for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre , even for this film . Ultimately , however , you can see why this film is a cult one ; I can't see many people being indifferent to it . Unfortunately terrible would be the way I would sum this up .  
  .. this mini does not get better with age . I saw this and it 's sequel when originally broadcast , and like so many others was blown away . In early 2002 I borrowed the novels for both WOW and W and R and was even more impressed . I then decided that I had to see both again and invested $ 200 plus on the DVD sets . I watched both minis again in painful detail and realized I had done things backwards - I should have purchased the novels and borrowed the DVD 's . Don't believe it is abysmally miscast ? Read the novels and see for yourself . Don't think this is dated ? Screen it for somebody not old enough to have seen it originally broadcast and watch the reaction you get ( warning - reactions from such people range from looks of horror to belly laughs ) . According to the trivia section for this mini - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum . Yikes ! Production quality , music scoring , dialog - a great story was turned into a late 70 's soap opera by an overly ambitious producer / director who was in way over his head . This thing was dated the minute it was completed . These two minis were great when original broadcast and to those of us who saw them then , tug at a nostalgic string that reminds us of younger days . IMO - this mini does not nearly live up to its reputation and severely disappoints .  
  What a disgrace ! I was checking this out hoping it would be an undiscovered James Garner gem and what a stinker it turned out to be ! The production quality was fine , but the plot was undeniably lame and I can honestly say that I am only a couple hours older and a lot dumber now . The movie really had no redeeming qualities and if this kind of stuff keeps coming out , it will give Hallmark a bad name . For those of you who insist on knowing what it was about , it 's about nothing , and in this case , it 's not a good thing . We are subjected to watching one old ornery woman who is one of the dumbest creatures ever to roam the earth , who happens to be married to a real sweetheart who is probably the only person alive that could put up with her . She drags him through one mess after another , gets him into one embarrassing situation after another , and is proud of herself the whole time . Then the movie ends . What a relief that was ! Not worth the time it would take to watch it , so do yourself a favor and skip this one , you 'll be glad you did if you knew how bad this one really is .  
  Remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood because he made great movies ? Those days are feeling like a more and more distant memory . While " Hollywood Homicide " is by no means terrible , it is a routine and surprisingly boring buddy cop movie . It 's a comedy that 's not particularly funny , and an action movie that 's not especially exciting . An overabundance of subplots cannot mask the weakest of the central storyline . Ford at least appears to be enjoying himself more than is his last few projects , and he is able to carry the film most of the time . Hartnett is adequate , but he and Ford aren't exactly Newman and Redford as far as chemistry is concerned . All in all , " Hollywood Homicide " is a reasonably amusing diversion , but just barely . Take out Ford , and it 's not even that .  
  What a load of rubbish .. I can't even begin to describe how awful this film was . The rating it has here is really hard to believe . Avoid .. Particularly if you enjoyed the first ginger snaps . The first one was well written , well directed , well executed .. a brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere . The second one was ' alrite '- decent as a self-standing film , but clearly not up to the level of the first .. The third is an insult to the series , period . I rate the films : 10 , 6 , 1 . It 's that bad . Oh , and yes it really is set in the past , the sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald .. all muddled in with some half-assed native American mythology . The sisters don't have any real story , or progression , or even a clear relationship .. They 're just trying to survive and be ' together forever ' . That 's about as deep as it gets . Staggered that the girls agreed to be in this pile-of-shite , after reading the script . Oh and another thing , staging of action was terrible - people appearing from nowhere regularly , like the girls turn around and there 's an elaborate candle-lit setup with a mystic native American woman just sitting there , about to go into a speech . Sets were terrible , couldn't get away from the fact that it was all obviously based in a set , which really didn't help . Also , there was consistently snow outside the camp , but not a trace inside ( .. on the set ) . Arrghh , so bad ! I really was hoping it would be at least as good as the second one .  
  Hey HULU . com is playing the Elvira late night horror show on their site and this movie is their under the Name Monsteroid , good fun to watch Elvira comment on this Crappy movie .. Have Fun with bad movies . Anyways this movie really has very little value other than to see how bad the 70 's were for horror flicks Bad Effects , Bad Dialog , just bad movie making . Avoid this unless you want to laugh at it . While you are at HULU check out the other movies that are their right now there is 10 episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can watch a lot of them in 480p as long as you have a decent speed connection .  
  .. This would be the worst film i 'd ever seen . Hmm , OK maybe tied with Boogeyman then . Awful , truly awful . I had low expectations and it failed to meet them ! I honestly cant think of one good thing . so here are the worst points .. 1 . THE ACTING 2 . THE PLOT 3 . THE CGI ( Xbox 360 has better graphics .. seriously ) 4 . THE PLOT 5 . THE DIALOGUE and finally .. 6 . THE PLOT There are so many unanswered questions , Did they make a 2:32 hour long movie then realize they hadn't put Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no-one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than Superman 's son and the henchman he kills ? ! Was half the budget spent on persuading Kevin Spacey to do it ? When Superman goes to hospital , why don't the doctors ask " What the F * do you want us to do ? ! He 's a F * ing alien ! We don't know jack about his anatomy ! " ? What happened in the 5 years Superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years ? Where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie ? and finally , Why ? Just , Why ? BTW , for those of you wondering how come Superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite , i think i 've figured it out .. .. since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks , it is clearly all in his head . therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock .. either that or the writers are slack-jawed half-wits who didn't think that was a fairly obvious mistake .  
  This movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classical theme . I used to love Superman movies , but this one made me want to shoot myself . Very poor acting , outrageous special effects , and a plot equal to zero . To summarize : Superman leaves earth , because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet , some were in space ( duh ) , doesn't tell his girlfriend anything before leaving ( duh again ) , takes off in a spaceship ( ? ! ? ) , comes back i think 5 years later , and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again ( who is now razing his son , which son , in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old ) . And what about that Lex Luthor ? Trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land ? Please ! I vote 1 out of 10 for this movie , only because i am not allowed to vote 0 . If you have anything else to do with your time , don't go to see this movie , and even if you don't have anything else to do , stay home and watch TV !  
  The film picks up after last years remake with the military setting up electronic surveillance equipment in the desert where the attacks in the first film happened . The crew is killed not long before a group of soldiers on a training exercise show up to find no one around . You can fill in the rest . This is a paycheck picture all around . There seems to be no passion in anyone 's performances , nor in anyone behind the camera . This is a movie that was made for the money and nothing else . On some level this should have worked , it could have been a more horrific Southern Comfort ( where National Guardsmen run afoul of some people in the swamps ) , but instead its not much of anything . In large part you can blame the script , written unbelievably in part by Wes Craven , which hits the same old targets again and again . Add to the mess the fact that the direction is dull and the set up of sequences is so lack luster as to remove any inherent tension in any scene . Its not bad as such , but badly made and dull . Let me put my feelings into context : The reason I saw this film was because a local multiplex screwed up and ran this film instead of the kids flick the Last Mimzy and I wanted to see what caused the out cry ( I mean the films have so much in common-he says sarcastically ) . I 'm convinced that this film will only scare those who like the last Mimzy .  
  Isn't anyone else tired of that old cliché ' where a nearly dead person shows up in a horror film , gives us some informations , and then blasts his head off for no apparent reason ? I know I am . The sad thing is that it 's use in this film is worthless . If you have seen the first film ( the first remake I should say ) then the information given is completely worthless , because you would have already known it . I guess , you can that it isn't worthless to the main characters .. but then why does the idiot shoot himself in the head ? Wouldn't he want to live ? Sure , he would have died anyway .. This is the second film to be titled " The Hills Have Eyes II . " The first being the sequel to the original 70 's film . This is where it gets a little complicated for someone like me . See , I 'm probably part of minority of people my age that even knew there was a HHE2 to begin with , much less an original HHE1 . And now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is named exactly as the sequel to the original HHE1 .. it just makes it worse ! But anyways .. Wes Craven 's original Hills Have Eyes was decent . In the end , though , the idea was better than the presentation , but he most likely had a low budget . To be quite honest , Wes Craven isn't that good of a horror director . He 's only made a few good horror movies ( Nightmare on Elm St . , New Nightmare ) , a few alright ones ( Scream ) and a bunch of horrible ones ( Cursed , Shocker , Vampire in Brooklyn ) . Oh yeah , and he made Swamp Thing , as well .. but the original HHE2 falls under the latter category . I 've only seen a few minutes , but it was terrible . Now he has co-written the new HHE2 .. and it 's such a disappointment ! Last year 's HHE remake was even better than the original film . It was tense . I guess it had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family , and not a bunch of beer and pot and sex crazy teenagers . It made us feel dirty . For the first hour , we were in hell , and finally in the last few moments , the good guys got revenge on the bad guys and it felt good .. This new film has no tension . No suspense whatsoever . Just violent things happening to mostly stupid people . There is hardly any menacing presence here . Just ugly hobos hiding under rocks . I 'm getting tired of horror movies where people die because of the stupid mistakes they keep making . It was just the other day that I watching " Deep Blue Sea " where Samuel L . Jackson kept on walking around the water , while giving the speech , and then he gets eaten by a shark , only because the idiot stayed to close to the water .. something that nobody would do in the given situation ! Here is the exact same thing . People go off by themselves to take a leak even though they know people are dying .. seriously , couldn't a potty break wait ? And then when you think people would have learned , someone else goes of by themselves ! Seriously , isn't more scary when the characters are bringing their A-game and still losing ? I would think so .. It even under delivers . It should have made the first remake look like " The Fog " remake ( which was less menacing than an episode of " Becker " ) . More bad guys . More time in the caves . More tension . More of everything . But it actually downgrades . Less bad guys . No tension . Sure we have more time in the caves , but not a whole lot happens there . In the end , it only seems like there is two or three bad guys . The last film made it seem like a whole tribe of people . Where is this tribe ? Who keeps on watching them through binoculars ? Seriously , these are the things this film should have brought us , but it ends with the exact same promise that the last film gave us , with that exact same " being watched " scene . Come on ! I 'll give the devil it 's due . The look of the film is good .. but thats it . I don't even think fans of gore will like this .. though I 'm probably wrong ! There is gore ( though most of it is sped-up while in the dark ) , but without the tension , and characters you even care about .. the gore does nothing in my book ! In the end , you 're not frightened . You ; re not shocked ( unless you 're an 8 year old girl ) . You don't even feel like you have seen anything new .  
  In a way , Corridors of Time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal : being seen by thousands . But it fails at making them laugh .. Les Visiteurs has had its success , because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel : forget about Zemeckis 's Back to the future , here comes the old France , the middle-age knight and its nearly barbaric way of life . Full of pride , funny thanks to the ancient words he uses , Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor . Then comes the sequel . Nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs , the first . And it 's no use being a movie expert to realize that the Corridors of Time has been made for money . The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs , and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought . Explanation : it 's no use trying to get back the jewelry Jacquouille has stolen ; don't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode ? Where do you think he found the money ? Selling the jewelry .. And that 's only one of many holes Poiré tries to avoid .. and fails . Let 's have a look at the characters : Montmirail doesn't change , he 's just a little more boring . Regarding Frenegonde .. that 's another story : Valérie Lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role . And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so pitiful I nearly felt pain for her . And Poiré doesn't realize that a cast of humorists isn't enough to make a good comedy . Forget about the time travels , about the digital effects , concentrate on the story and you 'll see that there 's enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times . The main interest of this film is the landscapes . A movie for youngsters , let 's say up to 13 years old .  
  Picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says " lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public ( also black ) in the street and ask him if he is black , then walk away " . The other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode . More laughter . Now if you think the premise is funny , and the show contains many such types of situation , you will enjoy this show . For the rest , use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry . Those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny . Another example of the humor in the show , a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier . Marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers ? I could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers , divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all .  
  Carrie Fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this movie during a period of her life when she had a heavy cocaine problem , and she doesn't remember very much of it . That would explain why she made this film , but it doesn't explain why anyone else in the cast or crew did ; I can't believe that EVERYBODY had a coke problem . This has to be one of the absolute worst movies ever made , and that 's saying something . The blame can't be laid at the feet of " director " Tim Kincaid or " writer " Buddy Giovinazzo , as it is obvious that this picture wasn't written or directed by anyone . Apparently it just spontaneously came together , as there is little evidence of coherency , consistency , design , plot , sense , intelligence or anything else . What is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this glop . Co-star Robert Joy has done good work in other films , and composer Jimmie Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks are both industry veterans , Marks also having been a director , and not a bad one . Why they got involved in this steaming pile of offal is beyond comprehension . Tim Kincaid , the alleged " director " , has made quite a few low-rent sci-fi and horror films , and , having seen most of them , I can tell you that not a one of them is any good . This one , though , is by far the worst thing he 's ever done , and that is a major accomplishment on his part . Everything , absolutely EVERYTHING , about this movie is 12th-rate-at best . The cinematography is terrible , the acting is laughable , the " special effects " make " Plan 9 From Outer Space " look like " Spider-Man " , the story is trite , derivative and stupid . Don't waste your time even looking at the video box cover , let alone renting it . A complete , utter , annoying , total dud .  
  Andy Lau stars in another cop undercover tale . Daniel Wu plays Nick who is working for the cops and is also close to the top of a drug dealing gang ( Lau ) . The movie begins as we watch the police try to make a drug bust only to see it go to pieces . We then are introduced to the young drug addicted mother and her daughter living near Nick and to his cronies and the cops , and 45 minutes in I shut off the movie and put on the news . Well acted and great to look at this is as uninvolving a movie as I 've seen in a long time . Its not bad as such its just you really don't care . I mean I really didn't care at all . I actually started to do something else completely forgetting I had on a subtitled movie on , thats how much I didn't care . I wish I could have hated the film but the film is such a nonentity that it made almost no impression on me ( its not even something I could sleep to its just something to ignore ) . Come on the box called it the Chinese Scarface , what after he was dead ? This is one to avoid .  
  Creepshow 2 had a lot of potential , they just didn't put enough time in perfecting it . The stories were pretty cool and creepy enough , but it was lacking . It 's a good movie , but after you 've seen it once , you might want to see it again . This movie could of been better .  
  The Rookie suffers from so much . There are the random musical songs interspersed through the movie , the long pointless script and enough grating slapstick to make Jerry Lewis blush . Noonan and Leavitt just don't know when to quit . It takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked . Then the guys start playing Japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day . It is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when Noonan and Leavitt are playing the stupid , stereotyped Japanese guys . But , it gets pretty tiring after switching back and forth between two sets of characters . Then it just abruptly ends . Even a naked Julie Newmar in a towel can't save this one . There is really little charm in the movie and it is over a half hour too long . The story just flounders along trying to set up funny situations and failing . Stick to Martin & Lewis . At least Deano had charm and Jerry had that animated face .  
  What this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie . Unfortunately with disjointed storytelling , frustrating plot-holes , and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly " the greatest monster movie ever . " Let 's start with the good stuff : comedy , acting and special effects . From the get-go , this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky . The opening scene - the monster 's origin - is campy and quick , paying homage the the classic ' environmental ' disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters . The pacing is fast , which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action . With in the course of 10 minutes you get the ' why ' , ' where , ' and ' how ' of the beast and are ready for action . In this the movie delivers . After another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced : the lazy son and his precocious little girl , kind grandfather , and talented sister ( aunt ) and , of course , the monster . The characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent , allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work . The monster it 's self looks great : alien yet familiar - kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid . The effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you ' see it 's strings . ' Even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar , like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd , slipping on surfaces , crushing and eating those in it 's path . When the monster 's path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment , and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie 's appeal begins to unravel . Following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity . Plot-lines are introduced , then abandoned , characters change their position for no apparent reason , and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent , while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random . As for the comedy , let me say this : I 'm willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural . I am not familiar with Korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation . However , as an Asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in Japan for the last 5 years ( still here ) I 'd like to think I have a better grasp on Asian humor than the average white-guy . That being said there were many parts of the movie that I understood were supposed to be funny , but , to me , weren't . * SPOILER * For example : after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral ; everyone is mourning . A new character is introduced - a brother - and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another . They both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder . This competition is , at it 's core , funny : two brothers who dislike each-other so much they even compete at a funeral - it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in Asian comedy . This subtle slap-stick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but , seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl . * END SPOILER * Then come the plot holes . there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained , or , worse , are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end . Finding out an obstacle isn't an obstacle can be a good thing for a character , but you 'd expect some comment to that nature . Instead the audience is barraged by moments of anti-climax when problems just ' aren't there ' anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start . So I ask you : why even bring it up in the first place ? This was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems , and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other . Of course introducing new and greater problems is a time-tested story telling tradition , but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation . Not in this movie . Instead it was as if you get several stories , each only explained 20 % of the way and , in the end , the parts never converge to complete the whole . Again , I 'm willing to accept that a lot of this might be ' cultural . ' Maybe its in Korean story - telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy . Maybe it 's normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every-page , but never finishes one . Maybe it 's OK to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis . Or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves .  
  For Daniel Auteuil , ` Queen Margot ' was much better . For Nastassja Kinski , ` Paris , Texas ' was much better . The biggest disappointments were from Chris Menges ( ` CrissCross ' and ` A World Apart ' cannot even be compared with this one ) , and Goran Bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from ` Queen Margot ' for this movie ( Attention to the end of the film ) . If this was an American pop movie , I would not feel surprised at all ; but for a European film with more independent actors and director , a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple-minded and disappointing . There are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people . There are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone . And finally , there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys . Every character is shown in simple black and white terms : the good versus the evil . Plus , from the very beginning , I could understand how the story would end . Is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse ? I believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie . I think this movie was not disturbing , but very disappointing .  
  " Wild Tigers I have Known . " It will only be showing in big cities , to be sure . It is one of those films SO artsy , that it makes no sense what so ever , except to the director ! I HATE those ! And all of those oh-so-alternative / artsy people try DESPERATELY to find " metaphors " in what is EVIDENT horseshit . There was NO plot , no story , no moral , no chronology , and nothing amusing or even touching . To me , it was a bunch of scenes thrown together that had nothing to do with one another , and were all for " show " to show how " artsy " and " visual " they could get . It was an ATTEMPT at yet ANOTHER teen angst film , but missed the mark on every level humanly possible . Then the credits roll ! I was waiting for it to make SENSE ! I was waiting for " the good part . " I own about 60 independent films in my DVD collection , many of which could arguably be called " art house " films . This will NOT be amongst them . You will be very angry at yourself for paying to see this film , much less ever buying it on DVD .  
  I haven't actually finished the film . You may say that in this case I have no right to review it , especially so negatively . But I do , only because I stopped it on account of I couldn't watch anymore .. I got over halfway , and I only got there by promising myself something good was just around the corner . This film is so tiresome , so lackluster that I was actually insulted . I haven't read many of the other reviews , so I 'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have suffered through it , but I am homosexual , and I did go through " similar " revelations , day dreams , issues etc etc . There were maybe two moments where I actually felt this film could go somewhere , where I felt it may have some inkling of meaning , or relativity , but these hopes were dashed the moment the next set of cliché-ridden narration came on . I mean , just look at the quotes on the IMDb page . Unfortunately you 're not able to hear the scratchy play back , nor the echo-ey fades if you 're just read the quotes , because they are just too painful / ridiculous / stupid to miss . I did give the film three stars , and all three of those stars go to the films cinematographer who did a fantastic job attempting to transform Archer 's tired " concepts " into something watchable . Mind you , I pray he wasn't the one who decided to include all the long shots of TV closeups .. another unnecessary cliché already over done in films such as Korine 's Gummo .. I think it is extremely fitting that this film premiered at Sundance ( only because Archer had connections in the festival via volunteer work he did , by the way .. ) because Sundance seems to be the one festival where cliché heavy drivel like this is still accepted as " arthouse " . No , it 's not art house , I 'm afraid it 's just plain s * t-house . Do not watch .  
  I have read the novel Reaper of Ben Mezrich a fews years ago and last night I accidentally came to see this adaption . Although it 's been years since I read the story the first time , the differences between the novel and the movie are humongous . Very important elements , which made the whole thing plausible are just written out or changed to bad . If the plot sounds interesting to you : go and get the novel . Its much , much , much better . Still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by Ben Mezrich .  
  Hanna-Barbera sucks the life out of another famous property . The violence is watered down , the stories are formulaic , the animation is bad , the music is obnoxious and repetitive , and frankly , the show just isn't funny . At the time , H-B put every one of its series through the same clichéd situations , regardless if it fit the world of the cartoon or not . Thus , Popeye and Bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen ( " Hey ! Popeye is popular , and the Flinstones are popular . Put ' em together , and you can't miss ! " ) . Also , in an apparent ripoff of " Private Benjamin , " Olive Oyl and the Goon have a regular segment that features them as new army recruits . Seriously ! Why ? Adding to the annoyance factor are the public service announcements in every episode ( standard practice at the time for cartoons , but still annoying ) . Popeye lectures his nephews on crossing the street safely , recycling , and - are you ready for this ? - the dangers of smoking ! ( I swear I 'm not making that up . ) The only charm remaining from the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer , the voice of Popeye from the early days , continues the role here . Worth checking out once just to get a new appreciation for the old Fleischer shorts . Otherwise , avoid at all costs .  
  The movie that shoots scenes of a scenic caverns tour . Remember no one from this movie except for Michael Pataki who dished out extreme pain as JC in " Five the Hard Way " . He 's the really annoying sheriff who I did applaud when he practices nightstick on our rabid doctor . Probably the most laughs you will have is with Dr . Beck 's epileptic seizures out of nowhere . Could Mrs . Beck be anymore wooden ? Seriously , if you took a 4 foot branch , stuck it in a hot tub , you wouldn't be able to notice a difference . The dread and suspense is looking over at the clock wondering when the credits will roll . Watch it as a late night movie , MSTified , but don't go out of your way .  
  I saw this movie on mystery science theater when it was called " It lives by night " . That title is much less misleading than " Batpeople " . In fact it would more accurately be called Batperson . This movie is about a doctor who studies bats I am thinking because he wants to make a better cure for rabies . This is not really clear . What is clear is that he and his wife take a tour of a cave and he gets bitten by a bat . Why a scientist needs to take a tour to study bats is beyond me . Shouldn't he be able to go in by himself . Well after being bitten he and his wife go on their honeymoon where he starts having fits . They go to the worst doctor ever . The guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse . In the end the guy kills 3-4 people and his wife stands by him and you are supposed to be rooting for him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders .  
  " Don't Drink the Water " is an unbelievably bad film . It 's based on a 1966 Broadway play by Woody Allen . It stars Jackie Gleason , the comic genius behind " The Honeymooners " . The director , Howard Morris , has appeared in several Mel Brooks comedies ( Life Stinks , High Anxiety , Silent Movie ) and has made a mark in animation ( characters he has voiced include Gopher from " Pooh " , Jughead ( Archie ) and Beetle Bailey ) What went wrong ? I think the problem is that the premise is played out too seriously to work effectively . Allen 's original play was tongue-in-cheek , which is why it worked on Broadway and in Allen 's 1994 remake . The screenplay by R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock beats the premise to death and makes too many changes from the original play . Making Gleason 's wife an airhead in this version when she was a headstrong woman in the original is just one example of why this doesn't work . The acting isn't much better . Gleason does the best he can with the material , but he can't save this . Gleason was a comic genius , but also a fine actor as he demonstrated in " The Hustler " and " Soldier in the Rain " . His abrasive personality could have worked here , but the lousy script doesn't even give him a chance . Too bad . Estelle Parsons ' airhead wife will drive you nuts after 20 minutes . See how soon it 'll take for YOU to want to strangle her . That is also a shame because she is also a fine actress , having turned in two exceptional performances in " Bonnie and Clyde " and " Rachel , Rachel " None of the other actors do particularly well either . Woody Allen hated this film so much that he remade the film in 1994 with himself and Julie Kavner ( Marge Simpson ) in the leads . They manage to hit all the right notes and the film itself is a comic masterpiece . It 's finally on video after a long battle over rights . Do go out and find that version . All the 1969 original is good for is clearing out unwanted guests who overstay their welcome . 1/2 * out of 4 stars  
  I sought out a copy of The Forest because I was watching a VH1 special , I think " Where Are They Now " , and saw the video box flash across the screen during a segment on the actor Corky Pigeon . He played the male child ghost in this B horror horrible , but I remember him from his character Freddy on the Silver Spoons television show . This flick 's a major letdown . There 's nothing here . It actually took me four months to watch it from start to finish . I kept stopping it in boredom , setting it aside and forgetting about it , then stumbling on it and trying once again to get through it . Obviously , the angle of this film that was intended to set it apart from its counterparts was the supernatural element , the apparitions . And obviously , here , that doesn't work . I can't stand the male leads . I kept expecting them to look down at their palms during the longer dialogue scenes in order to read cheat lines . The situation at the beginning where the couples decide to go camping separately is awkward and plain dumb . I guess the only positive thing to say about this one is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg , you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh . It 's fairly good gore makeup there . Man , I 'm really reaching for a positive now , huh . The only other no-budget horror film on a level as bad as this one would be Home Sweet Home .  
  I watched this film last night with anticipation , but really wasn't very impressed . With the exception of ' Combo ' , I thought the acting was poor and the narrative was limited . It came across like a ' made for TV ' drama . I felt that the film was very contrived . The whole set up of hammering in the context at the start ( yes , we get that this is 80s Britain - you can stop now ) was tiresome , and gave a very one-sided view of what life was like in 80s Britain - poverty , war juxtaposed with royalty , Margaret Thatcher , yet nothing in between ? There were actually middle-classes who existed back then - just ordinary working people , with a decent wage and a mortgage . The Falklands clips also seemed to be added randomly towards the end , for ' dramatic effect ' , I presume . The sequence of events felt a tad disjointed , as the characters moved one one action to the next without us seeing how their mindset could 've changed so quickly . The relationship between ' Shaun ' and ' Smell ' was toe-curling . I couldn't even look during the snogging scene . I find it very hard to believe that she would 've been attracted to a boy who was not only so much younger , but also looked so much younger . I know there were only four years between them , but four years is nothing once you reach your twenties , yet it 's a huge difference in your teens ! In my experience , that kind of teen age difference only occurs when the girl is the younger one , since girls mature so much quicker , and are more on the wavelength of boys a few years older . Sorry , but I didn't buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for shock value . The ending was somewhat abrupt and , again , contrived . If the flag throwing incident was supposed to be iconic , then it fell somewhat short in my eyes . It bugs me that British films only concern themselves with either the upper classes or the poverty-stricken . Don't get me wrong , I love Trainspotting , and Four Weddings has its charms , but can't we Brits come up with anything different ? Why are our films always so hung up on the class system ? I was born in 1973 , so wasn't much different in age to ' Shaun ' would 've been in 1983 . I grew up in a single parent family on a fairly down-trodden council estate in a city in England . However , my childhood experiences were vastly different to those portrayed in the film - I don't even remember racism being an issue ( although i 'm not saying it didn't exist ) . ' This is England ' ? Not in my experience . The bottom line is that I felt this film lacked substance , and I was completely bored and unimpressed throughout .  
  Alien Hunter : 5 out of 10 : Is it me or does every movie that starts in Roswell , New Mexico suck . Take Alien mixed with The Thing , mixed with Contact , mixed with of all things On the Beach , The Andromeda Strain , the classroom scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark and a throw in a little Stargate to boot . Derivative doesn't even begin to describe this movie . Of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right ? Nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease . ( James Spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable Leslie Stefanson asks to join him . he turns her down . AGGH ! ) In fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it . I mean if your going to have impossibly good-looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an Antarctica research base why not go for broke . With about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie Alien Hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci-fi adventure . Needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the Alien itself is a horribly clichéd artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title . I also inquired during viewing what is with the Children of the Corn in space motif . ( Note that since Jason of Friday the 13th fame , Pinhead from Hellraiser and that Leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield ? ) The characters in the cornfield dress like Logan 's Run extras and I was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them . That however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant . The acting is mostly fine as Spader reprises his Stargate role while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest in Antarctic beachwear . John Lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it . Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper Children of The Corn in Space movie .  
  This was probably the worst movie ever , seriously . I could actually do better myself , it wasn't even set up properly . It 's like this movie had a $ 5 budget and left with change . Don't watch it . I didn't even get all the way through this movie , had to turn it off . I 've give this a 1/10 because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie , but actually turned into a really bad comedy . Basically , a bunch of girls crashed into a car , broke a headlight , and the owner of that car went after them . The bit that i saw was a women with a gun telling a load of girls to take all their clothes off , what the hell ? it must be some kind of cheesy porn movie as well .  
  I can't believe this is on DVD . Even less it was available at my local video store . Some argue this is a good movie if you take in consideration it had only a 4000 $ budget . I find this funny . I would find it very bad whichever the budget . Still more funny , I read the following in another review : " Dramatics aside , if you love horror and you love something along the lines of Duel ( 1971 ) updated with a little more story and some pretty girls thrown in , you 'll love this movie . " What ? ! ? This is a shame comparing those two movies . I give a " 1 " , since I can't give a " 0 " . I just don't see any way this movie could be entertaining .  
  " A Gentleman 's Game " uses the game of golf in a country club setting to illustrate an adolescent 's discovery about honesty , prejudice , and other life lessons . Several times I thought I knew where this film was heading , only to be proved wrong . Unfortunately , I 'm not so sure that the filmmakers ever knew where it was heading , either . The defining moment in this movie is probably the scene in which Gary Sinise mocks " The Karate Kid " and debunks any notions that he 's going to become a mentor to the adolescent golfer . It 's refreshing , in a way , that this movie refuses to follow most of the simplistic and over-worked movie formulas . However , too much of it still comes off as contrived . At the drop of a hat people drop all pretenses of civility , or fail to stick up for the things in which they believe , or are exposed for something far less respectable than their place in society assumes . Unfortunately , there is often no resolution to these moments . And except for the fact that the club serves as backdrop for them , there is no real continuity or linking of them . It 's a shame that the writers and director could not salvage a better film , especially given some of the talented actors and potential in the setup .  
  This is a film where the actors are all fine , especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino , in a film where every one of the three couples meet in a situation that feels verry forced to be either cute or to set the story in motion . In other words , it feels like they are contrived movie scenes , not like real life . Even if women who work at peep parlors ever go out with one of their customers , it just doesn't seem realistic at all the way it is written in this film . Also , when one of the characters meets the overweight woman in the film , it feels artificial , the way they look at each other seconds after arguing . Again , the actors are all good , and moments of this film are nice , but overall yet another indie that could have used some rewriting before production got rolling .  
  I love these actors , but they were wasted in this flick . I can only wonder , what WERE they thinking agreeing to this crap ? Debra Winger just phoned it in ; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were caricatures . Some people thought it was deep . Well , if you liked " Breaking the Waves " , you 'll probably like this too . I hated both . 3/10  
  Quite unimpressive . The ' twists ' are all pretty predictable , if you 've seen any movies within the last ten years , and the few somewhat interesting parts ( wherein someone utilizes context clues to make a decision ) are few and lack much punch , since the ' secret ' has already been shown before these clues are explained . ( spoilers , sorta ) The acting is decent enough . The story simply isn't very interesting . The whole ' still awake ' premise becomes nullified by the astral projection stuff ( not kidding ) . The surgery scene is initially tense , a bit discomforting , but then becomes utterly banal . Not horrible , but not memorable . Terrence Howard 's least interesting role to date , so far as I 've seen . Kind of boring , overall .  
  From the beginning this movie did have a few flaws . The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a the rich young mogul who has inherited his father 's considerable wealth and power , and he is struggling to both fill his father 's shoes and cut the apron strings mother ( and co-executive ) keeps too tight . He also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the limbo that is the organ donor registry . There are also minor back stories which your first instinct is to mostly ignore that become important later , such as his friendship with his surgeon ( Terrence Howard ) and his romance with a middle class girl ( Jessica Alba ) . Uncreative story lines , but not bad enough to ruin the movie . The only real " oy vey ! " moment was the name of Lena Olin 's character . Overbearing woman named Lilith .. subtle ! The surgical scenes are not at all censored . I appreciated that , people who find surgery scenes scary might not . The horror of being awake during anesthesia was done well at first . You watch in emotional agony as Christensen screams inwardly through the chest incision and the rib spreader . The moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia , he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him . The big twist , however , is very predictable and sends the film delving into the conspiracy and his memories of the little signs which were there but he , like us , initially missed . There are two more twists at the end involving his relationship with his mother . One is an impressive gesture by Olin , which comes of as unimpressive due to poor writing . The other is a secret about the family 's past which seemed very tacked on and pointless . The initially well done anesthesia awareness drama gets lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama . There is a one final attempt to bring it back which falls flat , taking the entire movie with it .  
  This film just goes around in circles , and the viewer does not know where they are . At first I thought .. mm , could be kinda cool movie this , but it just drags on and on , and eventually you don't know what 's going on . The lead female is a good actress and played her role well , and the psycho fella , is creepy , but after a bit you don't really care what happens , because this film just drags on . Shame really , this could have turned out a lot better . Would say though that the lead female and psycho fella , will have a good career ahead of them , but will they remember this film , for making them known , or for being the film they regret they ever made .  
  I rented this movie because it falls under the genres of " romance " and " western " with some Grand Canyon scenery thrown in . But if you 're expecting a typical wholesome romantic western , forget it . This movie is pure trash ! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN ! The child is also lusted after by other leering men . It 's sickening . Peter Fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields , and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship . He tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy , loving couple . It 's revolting . I don't see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles .  
  SPOILES Lame south of the border adventure movie that has something to do with the blackmail of a big cooperate executive Rosenlski the president of Unasco Inc . by on the lamb beachcomber David Ziegler who 's living the life of Reilly , or Ziegler , in his beach house in Cancun Mexico . Having this CD , that he gave to his brother James , that has three years of phone conversations between Rosenlski and the President of the United States involved in criminal deals . This CD has given David an edge over the international mobsters who are after him . The fact that James get 's a little greedy by trying to shake down Rosenlski for 2 million in diamonds not only cost him his life but put David in danger of losing his as well . Ropsenlski want 's to negotiate with David for the CD by getting his ex-wife Liz to talk to him about giving it up , Rosnelski made a deal to pay off her debts if she comes through . David is later killed by Rosenliski 's Mexican hit-man Tony , with the help of a great white shark , who just doesn't go for all this peaceful dealings on his boss ' part . Tony had taken the CD that Liz left for his boss at a local hotel safe and now want 's to murder James , like he did David , and at the same time keep the CD to have something over Rosenlski . David who had secretly hidden the diamonds that James had on him at the time of his murder is now the target of Tony and his men to shut him up for good . David also wants to take the diamonds and at the same time give his boss Rosenlski the impression that the CD that David had is lost but use it later , without Rosenlski knowing who 's behind it , to blackmail him . The movie " Night of the Sharks " has a number of shark attacks in it with this huge one-eyed white shark who ends up taking out about a half dozen of the cast members including Tony . David who 's a firm believer in gun-control uses knives high explosives and Molotov cocktails , as well as his fists , to take out the entire Tony crew . Even the killer shark is finished off by Tony but with a hunting knife , not a gun . When it came to using firearms to save his friend and sidekick Paco a girlfriend Juanita and his priest Father Mattia lives from Tony and his gang guns were a no-no with David ; he was more of a knife and spear man then anything else . The ending of the movie was about as predictable as you can make it with David thought to be killed by the one-eyed shark later pops up out of the crowd , after Rosenlski was convinced that he 's dead and leaves the village . David continues his life as a free living and loving beachcomber with no one looking to kill him and about two million dollars richer . to David 's credit he had his friend Paco give Rosenski back his CD but under the conditions that if anything happened to him his cousin , who Rosenlski doesn't know who and where he is , will shoot his big mouth off and let the whole world know about his dirty and criminal dealings .  
  [ CONTAINS SPOILERS ! ] Timon and Pumbaa are watching The Lion King . Timon decides to go back BEFORE the beginning , to when the story really began . So they go back . Way back . Back even before Simba was born . Back to Timon 's old home which was miles away from Pride Rock . A clan of meerkats burrowed underground to hide from hyenas . The worst digger in the clan was a pompous , self-centered meerkat named Timon . His mother took pity on him but Uncle Max just shook his head . Mother suggested putting Timon on sentry duty ; Timon had dreams of a bigger and better place out there somewhere . Just then , hyenas Shenzi , Bonzai and Ed arrived and nearly killed poor Uncle Max . That did it . The other meerkats just wanted Timon to go away while Timon took it upon himself to leave . So he kissed his mom goodbye and started off . He didn't get very far before he started getting homesick . Just then he met Rafiki , who taught him to look beyond what he sees . Timon had no clue what that meant so he continued on and met a warthog named Pumbaa , who was all alone due to a flatulence problem . Timon and Pumbaa join up then , but Timon declared them acquaintances , rather than friends . They soon arrive at Pride Rock where all the zebras , antelopes , wildebeests , rhinoceroses , giraffe 's , elephants and many other plain animals had gathered . What was going on ? Timon didn't care . They pressed on . Timon then saw Rafiki atop Pride Rock lifting into the air something he couldn't see . Just then all the animals took a bow . Was this to honor the birth of the new king ? No , Pumbaa had passed gas and the animals were bowing to cover their noses ; Timon and Pumbaa try an assortment of new homes , but each are discomforting due to incessant singing or hyenas or a large stampede of wildebeests ! Pumbaa and Timon suddenly find themselves heading down stream . When they reach land , Timon decides to give up . But then they gaze around at their newfound paradise . It was beautiful : trees and water falls as far as the eye could see . Timon named the place after a strange phrase he learned from Rafiki : Hakuna Matata . Timon and Pumbaa go out bowling for buzzards one afternoon when they suddenly run into Simba . They take him under their wing and become father figures . They teach him the arts of bug eating and belching contests . Pretty soon , a teenage Simba takes on Timon in a snail slurping contest . Simba won , leaving Timon deathly ill . Then one day , Simba 's childhood friend Nala arrived . Timon and Pumbaa just knew she 'd break up the friendship . Suddenly , Simba runs away . Nala and Pumbaa race after him , but not Timon . He chose to stay at " Hakuna Matata " by himself , until Rafiki " talked " some sense into him , so he joins his friends at Pride Rock . Timon 's mother and Uncle Max arrive then . While Simba battles Scar , Mother and Max dig a large hole to trap hyenas Shenzi , Bonzai and Ed in . It worked . Scar is soon flung down the same hole where he is devoured by the hyenas . Then all is well . Mother , Uncle Max and the rest of the meerkats go live with Timon and Pumbaa in the paradise that is Hakuna Matata . Back to the present , Timon and Pumbaa finish the movie when suddenly Mother , Uncle Max , Simba and Rafiki want to watch it again . So do Mickey Mouse , Donald Duck , Goofy , Snow White , the Seven Dwarfs , Dumbo , Peter Pan , the Lost Boys , Mad Hatter , March Hare , Genie , Aladdin , and Jasmine . Well , I must say that The Lion King 1 1/2 wasn't as good as I had hoped . It was too ridiculous and silly . The original Lion King was a masterpiece . It had a serious story with light comedy thrown in . This one was just silly and made a mockery of it . I swear , sometimes Timon and Pumbaa are just way too overplayed . They 're overplayed to the point of no longer being funny , just annoying . The original voice cast is back : Nathan Lane as Timon , Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa , Matthew Broddrick as Adult Simba , Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi , Cheech Marin as Bonzai , Jim Cummings as Ed , Robert Guillame as Rafiki . New to the cast are Julie Kavner of TV 's ( Too ) long running series The Simpsons as Timon 's mom and Jerry Stiller as Uncle Max . So anyway , this movie isn't The Lion King II , and it isn't II because there already is a II . It takes place right after Part I and Part II is a ways away . Hence , it 's 1 1/2 . In conclusion , I don't recommend this to die hard Lion King fans because it 's far too ridiculous and frivilous . However the kids will love it so I recommend it to them . I hope this will also be the LAST Lion King movie . Two is enough . " The Lion King 1 1/2 " . What we 've come to expect from Disney sequel makers . -  
  For me every piece of art is to be judged by these criteria : Form , Function and Meaning . Guernsey seems to be dedicated to forms : nice shots and sometimes interesting acting . The long close ups suggest a function that the viewer may fill in by himself . Because of lacking texts the story becomes a quiz . An introvert person suggests to have depth , but sometimes it turns out he has nothing to say . This film acts like an introvert person . If you have not read the synopsis you cannot see that it was the suicide ( and the unanswered question Why ? ) that changes Anna 's view on life and makes her suspicious . ' Why don't you speak to me ? ' asks Sebastiaan . Anna doesn't answer , she only starts looking a long time at him without saying a word . What is the function of that shot ? What does it mean ? My question is like Sebastiaans : What has this film to say ? What is meant by this movie ? The answer for me : It shows us a handful of persons with the passion of a glass of water . The story of their lives is simple and boring . Motives behind their actions are not shown . The rest is : skins , residences , landscapes . Nice and artistic done , but meaningless without having disposal of ' instructions for use ' . In my opinion this film is made for fellow artists , not for the common viewer .  
  My friends and I rented this from Blockbuster because we saw Nana Visitor 's name on the box . This movie is a travesty I hope she negates from her CV . The " plot " was lose and flaccid , the acting was mostly dry and unbearable in some parts . The movie made no sense whatsoever . The rough plot of an alien parasite species that infects humans has been done many times by films with much better scripts than this , for example , invasion of the body-snatchers and The faculty . If you ever have the misfortune to come across this movie , I suggest you burn it . How it classes itself as a horror movie when there was no use of fear , suspense , gore , terror or any of the usual horror film techniques I don't know , however if you still find yourself wanting to watch this film I suggest you have a lot of sugar before hand , so you can find parts of it funny .  
  I love Julian Sands and will at least attempt to watch anything he 's in , but this movie nearly did me in . I 'm hard pressed to remember when I found any other movie to move .. so .. slow .. ly .. zz Pop it in the VCR when you 've run out of sleeping pills .  
  this movie was a horrible excuse for .. a movie . first of all , the casting could have been better ; Katelyn the main character looked nothing like her TV mom . also , the plot was pathedic . it was extremely cliché and predictable . the ending was very disappointing and cheesy . ( but thats all i 'll say about that ) . the nail in the bag though , was a scene when Katelyn ( jordan hinson ) was supposed to be crying , but the girl couldn't cry on command ! there were no tears streaming down her face , just a few unbelievable sobs . she is not a dynamic actress at all . she gave the same fake little laugh identical to that of hillary duff on lizzie Maguire ( sp ? ) . thats when the movie went from not-so-good , to just plain bad . it really looked like she was acting . in a nutshell : this movie was really bad ! it was kind of a mix of every cliché kid movie from the 1990 's that everyone 's sick of-only worse ! i give it an ' F ' , because it was just so darn hard to sit through ( b / t / w , i was babysitting when i saw it ) . however , you may like it if your 9 or under . ; )  
  From the awful death scenes to guns that fire without making sounds to a character called the Fiend . It 's all tiresome , slow moving , unimaginative drivel . It was OK seeing the guy with the cape and the hunchback lurking around . Visually it was creepy and probably occupied the moviegoer of the time , but even in 1936 one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a film like this . I just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were posing at an office picnic . And then there are those bullets as a previous commentator mentioned . Perhaps the best clue would have been to search for a water spot on someone 's pants pocket .  
  I could not , for the life of me , follow , figure out or understand the story . As the plot advances it too stays incomprehensible . I 'm going to guess and say that there was a preproduction story / plot problem that never got sorted out . The producers could never separate the many details that the novel , or any novel , has the time and space to create from the other idea , which was to make a movie about a serial killer and the killer 's pursuit by the police . They ended up with too many things happening in a proscribed feature film time limit . Too bad really because they had a solid cast , a director who knows how to move things around and excellent cinematography . In fact , a well made movie that one could enjoy and relax with for a couple of hours .  
  This engaging ( which it shouldn't be ) low-grade Spanish exploitation ( quite tame I might add ) looks good , but huh ? Let me phrase that again ' huh ? ' . Actually the word ' huh ? ' would be going through your mind quite a lot . Nothing makes sense , nor does it try too . I just don't know if its complicatedly cryptic or just a convoluted muddle , but there 's no denying how laconically uneventful , strange and wordy it feels . Unrelated sequences tied ( like that nasty opening involving a little girl , dead cat and fire ) in to a sparse story involving photographer Mario ( played by a chest-puffing John Caffari , who 's mustache is a dead ringer for Nintendo 's iconic Mario . What 's the odds ? ) that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady ( a gorgeously fixating Patty Shepard ) who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment , where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witches . Look past the unhinged plot structure and wallow in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease . Raul Artigot directs few jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages , but for most part seems sporadically non-existent and unfocused just like his writing . Ramon Sempere 's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away . However there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on . Fernando Garcia Morcillo 's hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created . The leads are capable , but there 's also a sturdy bunch ( the pick being Víctor Israel ) of secondary performances . Slow with little in the way of interest , but this dreamy set-up ( that seems to go on and on ) manages to keep you watching until its closing .  
  In all of low budget history . this movie has to be one of the worst . True ther are some humorous sides to the movie , but in general it was just plain awful . I just can't understand what person could not out run a bunch of slugs . I mean they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet . The only part worth while in this movie is the close up of a slugs attempt to bite the finger of a man . This was rather amusing .  
  I almost burst into tears watching this movie . Not from laughing but from the memories of a great Rodney Dangerfield movie . Candyshack was his first and stole the movie , Easy Money had him at his best , and Back To School is by far an 80 's classic masterpiece . Then there was Ladybugs and that 's when it started to show . Poor Rodney was getting old ( Meet Wally Sparks was a slight step up from Ladybugs but not saying much ) . In My 5 Wives Rodney plays Monte ( a name he must love since that was his name in Easy Money ) a rich ( isnt he always ) guy who loves women and gets married like its nothing . Well now he inherits a huge piece of land and since the land was run by the Amish , he inherits 5 Wives . This sounds like a great idea for a Dangerfield movie . The problem is EVERYTHING . The script is so poor that Rodney seems to be saying his one liners to the camera and all the side characters have nothing to do . The movie looks like it was shot on video with some really poor stunt sequences that are obviously not Rodney . Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster who looks like he is dying to say the F word ( which he should since the film is rated R but plays as if it was PG ) and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2 minute cameo . Don't get me wrong , at times I did laugh at a few of Rodney 's jokes but the poor man is getting way too old and way too slow . We can see his jokes coming from miles . And the film turns way too PC which thanks to the horrible 1990 's , the 70 's and 80 's Rodney just doesn't work anymore .  
  If you want to see women 's breasts , get a porno . There is no plot , but the last 45 minutes of this movie focus on resolving some sort of dangerous plan . The only value this movie has is that sometimes its so bad its funny , and , yes , boobs are boobs .  
  What an awful movie . I love monster flicks but I couldn't watch even half of the terrible acting , cardboard characters and abysmal special effects . There is nothing redeeming about this movie . The characters come from either an endless supply of suicidally stupid cannon fodder or else they are vacuous , uninspiring sock puppets . The plot is formulaic , cut and paste , standard science-run-amok drivel . Even the CGI is horrible . You know it 's bad when you can't even depend on the movie to provide some good eye candy . No surprises here , just same old same old . This is truly one of the worst films ever made . Director Roger Corman should be hung from a lightpost so that children can use him as a pinata .  
  First and foremost , I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury . It 's the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later . It was one of his best books , with , you know , Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine . I as just hoping that this movie would be all right . It had lots of chances , with a great cast , like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce . And Bradbury even wrote the script himself . And on top of all that , it has PAM GRIER ! How could it fail ? There may be spoilers within . First of all , it was dumbed down . Much of the horror from the book was lost as Bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum . All the visuals from the book .. gone . Everything that made you squirm .. gone . And then there 's the acting . Like a lot of movies that Disney threw out in the 80s , the kids in this movie cannot act . And , this bugged me a lot , neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10 . Their strong friendship wasn't addressed . It was more like they were acquaintaces . You 'd think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could pull this off in their roles of Mr . Halloway and Mr . Dark . But here it 's like they just don't care . All they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something . This is far from being some of their best performances . Pam Grier was fine as the witch , but the charecter of the Dust Witch herself wasn't well pulled off . She 's a lot less evil and doesn't have the presence as she did in the book . And everything that was left out of the book . The ballon night chase , the marking of Jim 's house , the real death of Mr . Dark , what happened to Mr . Coogan on the merry-go-round , the fate of the lightening rod salesman , the real death of the witch , and oh so much more . And the special effects were bad , even for the 80s . The merry-go-round of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasn't really creepy , and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything . I could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel , but it makes blood boil . Don't see this movie but read the book . It 's a classic of Bradbury .  
  Imagine that in adapting a James Bond novel into a movie , the filmmakers eliminated all the action and suspense in order to make it kid-friendly . Or if a television producer told Chris Rock he couldn't cuss so that his specials could be rated PG . In the same way , the director of the movie " Something Wicked This Way Comes " took out the excitement and gore in favor of melodrama for younger audiences . This created a monotonous plot without the complications of the book . In trying to make the story of " Something Wicked This Way Comes " easier for children to follow , the filmmakers eliminated the theme of good and evil both existing in everyone , and good always prevailing over evil . This is apparent in Will 's character transformation , Charles Halloway 's rescue of Jim , and the carnival 's defeat . Will 's transformation into a more adventurous boy has been muted in the movie . The scene in which the Dust Witch visits Will 's house in a balloon has been cut from the film . Instead , a green mist follows Jim and Will home and gives them the same bad dream about the Witch and her spiders . The balloon attack shows us that Will has begun to conquer his fear of doing things on his own . He gets on top of a neighbor 's roof and tears the balloon with a bow , defeating the Witch . " Sorry , Dad , he thought , and sat up , smiling . This time it 's me out , alone , " Will decides as he prepares to face her ( 147 . ) Removing this scene from the movie prevents us from understanding that Will is becoming more adventuresome . The film shows us many examples of Will being afraid to follow Jim , but never growing curious like his friend . In the book , Will has both a good , quiet side and an " evil , " daring side like his Jim . In the movie , each boy only has one mode of thought , which destroys Bradbury 's theme of both good and evil being present in each person . In the book , Will saves Jim because of their friendship , but , in the movie , Charles Halloway saves Jim to repay Jim 's father . Will pulls Jim off the carousel in Bradbury 's novel because he doesn't want his best friend to grow up without him . It is the good in Will , the fact that he cares about his friend , that saves Jim from the evil curse of the carnival . On the carousel , Jim " gestured his other hand free to trail on the wind , the one part of him , the small , white , separate part that still remembered their friendship " ( 269 . ) This shows that there was good left inside of Jim , which has the potential to still defeat evil . But when Charles Halloway saves Jim in the movie , he does it to repay the debt he owes Jim 's father , who saved Will when he was a little boy . By changing the motivation for saving Jim , the filmmakers have ruined Bradbury 's original idea that it takes good to win against evil . In the end of the movie , the carnival is defeated by a tornado and lightning instead of smiles and laughter . When the book ends , Mr . Dark turns himself into a little boy and Charles Halloway smiles and laughs at him so much that he can't stand it and evaporates . In Bradbury 's world , evil people feed off fear and can only be defeated by happiness and love . His message is that good will always prevail over evil , but only if that goodness is expressed outwardly . " Good to evil seems evil , " says Charles Halloway as he holds the dying Mr . Dark . " So I will do only good to you , Jed . I 'll simply hold you and watch you poison yourself " ( 275 . ) In the movie , Mr . Dark is the only one left on the carousel when lightning hits it , and he dies . By eliminating the weapon of laughter and smiles , the filmmakers imply that bad weather is the most effective way to defeat evil , as if lightning only strikes those who are bad . This takes away the major theme of Bradbury 's book , which is that doing " good " toward others wards off evil . Good may always triumph over evil , but trying to make movies more kid-friendly will always force filmmakers to leave out some of the themes from the books they are based on . In the movie , " Something Wicked This Way Comes , " Will does not transform , Will 's friendship does not save Jim , and smiles and laughter do not defeat the carnival . As a result , the filmmakers have left out too many of Bradbury 's main points . The process of adapting a book to a movie too often ruins the world the author has established . In the case of this story , Bradbury 's frightening world of opposing forces of good and evil has been reduced to a tamer , simpler version of itself .  
  If the only sex you 've ever had is with a farm animal , then the tag line for this movie is probably still misleading . This is by far one of the most boring movies I 've had the pleasure to try and watch lately . I found the DVD lying around at my friend 's house , and I made the sad mistake of not burning it . I am unable to tell any details without spoiling the movie because there are only about 5 details to this movie . Just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c-span only the fictional movie is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on c-span . I think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie , but I was unable to tell exactly what it was after I gouched my eyeballs out and threw them at Richard Gere .  
  Long , boring , blasphemous . Never have I been so glad to see ending credits roll .  
  A scientist ( John Carradine-sadly ) finds out how to bring the dead back to life . However they come back with faces of marble . Eventually this all leads to disaster . Boring , totally predictable 1940s outing . This scared me silly when I was a kid but just bores me now . I had to struggle to stay awake ! With one exception , the acting is horrible . Such expressionless boring actors ! Hopeless . There are some good things about this : Carradine , despite the script , actually gives a very good performance . And there are a few mildly creepy moments involving a ghost of a Great Dane walking through walls . There 's also one of the worst-looking knockouts in cinema history . Still , none of this is fun enough to sit through this . Avoid .  
  Casting bone to pick : David Jannsen was 38 playing the father of Robert Drivas , who was then , 31 ( yeah , I realize he 's supposed to be just out of college , but clues in the script have him being a loafer and so he 's probably 24-25 in the script - that still puts Jannsen in parenting classes in Junior High ) . I assume the AMA wrote medical miracle up in their 1938 Year in Medicine . This movie hasn't aged very well at all and now it 's main appeal is just to see a snap shot of Sin City , circa 1969 and all the incessant smoking , the weird hair ( Drivas has an atomic comb over that makes him resemble a well-groomed hip Cousin It ) and trendy fashions that went along with it . If anyone remembers , LV wasn't exactly London .. the city coddled the mob and codger gamblers in those days . Drivas comes off as sexually ambiguous ; his dad thinks he might be gay ( in a sad irony , Drivas himself died of AIDS at 47 ) and the soapy conflict is from the generation gap issue ( ahem , as if one may call 7 years a gap ) . Sonny boy wants to be his own man and dad wants to pull him into the casino ( Caesar 's Palace ! ) , and plies him with girls ( including the horny-for-money Edy Williams ) . Interestingly enough , the son doesn't seem to mind being thought of as gay - unusual for the time and a cute Brenda Vaccarro is nearby to swoon platonically over him . What nudity there is is awfully lame - just what was needed to pull the audience in for an ' R ' rating in the early days of the MPAA rating system ( which then was G-M-R [ 16 ] - and X ) . The editing is HORRIBLE and there 's stupid-silly overdubs by The Committee ( a late 60 's neo-avante-garde comedy troupe that mercifully faded off the map within a couple of years ) . Don Rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer .. seemingly preparing him for a role as a floor manager in the much better CASINO two decades later . Not to give anything away , but they would 've dealt with Mr . Rickles ' character with power tools and a hole in the desert back then . A curiosity at best , far from Joshua Logan 's usual caliber of work . Dos / Dias . Now go watch CASINO again ..  
  Cliff Robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a razzie-worthy performance here if there ever was one ; it 's as if director Michael Anderson kept yelling " dial it down ; think zombie , only less lively " through his little bullhorn as he coached Robertson 's effort . The rest of the cast is barely better ; Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN 'S RUN fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role . If the quality of the acting was three times better ; if some of the more gaping plot holes were filled ; and if the pacing were given a shot of adrenaline , then this yawner might be brought up to a standard acceptable to the Hallmark\Lifetime TV channel crowd . As is , its rating is so inexplicably high one can't help thinking chronic insomniacs are using DOMINIQUE to catch a little snoozing time . Perhaps the late-night TV telemarketers are missing a major opportunity in not shilling it as such .  
  Not very impressed . Its difficult to offer any spoilers to this film , because there is almost no development in the plot . Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there on its like watching paint dry . The acting seems very poor as well , and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist era films shown occasionally on daytime Chinese television . Although this is difficult to tell with the female role , Yuwen , as the story seems to only require her walking round like a wooden mannequin . It reminds me of fading star Gong Li who somehow got a reputation as a good actress in the West for having a scowl on her face all the time . Tian Zhuangzhuang 's film the ' Blue Kite ' was a far better film . But don't be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a Small Town was set in the late ' 40s . Unlike the Blue Kite , the fact that this film is set in a time of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself , the ruins of the town seem to be nothing more than a scenic backdrop . I wonder whether Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West and appeal to a foreign audience who can't tell the difference between a film that is ' beautiful ' ' profound ' or ' hypnotic ' and one that is simply tedious and insubstantial . If any film fits the description of ' overrated , ' this is it . I see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry .  
  I saw Brigadoon on TV last night ( 12 Sept 2009 ) . I am 61 years old and have been watching films as long as I can remember . I can truthfully say that Brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film I have ever seen . The accents were shameful . The local children 's club would have produced better sets . The characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them . It is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film . The owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film .  
  I never much liked the Myra movie , tho I appreciate how it pushed the Hollywood envelope at the time . Certainly Miss Welch 's costume became an iconic image , though I have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about - I rewatched Myra on FMC a couple of years ago and didn't think it had aged any better thru the years . There 's a segment about it in the Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History comic books , where it 's given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production . However , IMHO , the movie is too bitter to be charming , too silly to be a turn-on , and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform , engage , OR entertain -  
  It was the Sixties , and anyone with long hair and a hip , distant attitude could get money to make a movie . That 's how Michael Sarne , director of this colossal flop , was able to get the job . Sarne is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie . In fact , the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film , a terribly precious 60's-hip black and white featurette called Joanna . That film starred the similarly talentless actress / waif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression or bat-like twitter . Sarne , who was probably incapable of directing a cartoon , never mind a big-budget Hollywood film , was in way over his head . David Giler 's book is the best place to go to find out how the faux-infant terrible Sarne was able to pull the wool over everyone 's eyes . If there is ever an historical marker which indicates the superficiality and shallowness of an era , Myra Breckinridge provides that marker . It embodies the emptiness and mindless excess of a decade which is more often remembered for a great sea-change in the body politic . Breckinridge is a touchstone of another , equally important vein . Watch this movie and you 'll get a different perspective on the less-often mentioned vacuity of spirit which so often passed for talent during those years . Many reviewers have spoken about the inter-cutting of footage from other films , especially older ones . Some actually liked these clunky " comments " on what was taking place in the movie , others found them senseless , annoying , and obtrusive , though since the film is so bad itself any intrusion would have to be an improvement . In my opinion , the real reason Michael Sarne put so many film clips into Myra Brekinridge was to paper over the bottomless insufficiency of wit and imagination that he possessed . That is to say , Sarne was so imagination-challenged that he just threw these clips in to fill space and take up time . They weren't inspiration , they were desperation . His writing skills were nonexistent , and David Giler had wisely stepped away from the project as one might from a ticking bomb , so Sarne was left to actually try and make a movie , and he couldn't . It was beyond his slim capabilities . Hence the introduction of what seems like one half of an entire film 's worth of clips . The ghosts of writers and directors - many long since passed on - were called upon to fix this calamitous flopperoo because Sarne sure as heck wasn't able to . This was what he came up with on those days he sat on the set and thought for eight hours while the entire cast and crew ( not to mention the producers and the accountants ) cooled their heels and waited for something , some great spark of imagination , a hint of originality , a soupcon of wit , to crackle forth from the brow of Zeus . Um , oops . No Zeus + no imagination + no sparks = millions of little dollar bills with tiny wings - each made from the hundreds of licensing agreements required to use the clips - flying out the window . Bye-bye . As for myself , I hated the film clips . They denigrated Sarne 's many betters , poked fun at people whose talents - even those whose skills were not great - far outstripped the abilities of the director and so ultimately served to show how lacking he was in inspiration , originality - and even of plain competency - compared to even the cheesiest of them .  
  Watching this last night it amazed me that Fox spent so much money on it and got so little back on their investment . It 's the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed . I 'm sure that the first morning of filming Raquel Welch dusted off the shelf over her fireplace to prepare a spot for the Academy Award she would surely win for this daringly original movie . Oops . That 's not what happened . The infighting on the set was detailed in print by Rex Reed and this helped the movie attain a reputation before it was even released . When it was finally released there wasn't the usual three ring circus of publicity . If I remember correctly , in Houston it opened at drive-ins and neighborhood theatres and never played any of the big venues . I lay most of the blame on director Michael Sarne , who was hot after having directed ( the not all that good ) JOANNA , a film with music about young people in swinging mod London . If I recall correctly , Fox wound up firing him and piecing the film together the best they could . That 's why scenes play out in no particular sequence and characters appear and then vanish . An impressive supporting cast ( Kathleen Freeman , Jim Backus , John Carradine , Andy Devine and others ) is wasted with nothing to do . To expand it to feature length there are numerous clips from Fox movies featuring stars like Carmen Miranda ( in amazing footage from THE GANG 'S ALL HERE ) andLaurel and Hardy , who never dreamed they 'd be playing in an X rated movie . The X rating is due to occasional language numerous sexual perversions ; however , none of the characters seem to be having any fun . Maybe somebody involved with the film had a warped Puritan sensibility and figured that if they could make these things unappealing it wasn't bad to exploit them . This was one of the " youth " pictures that nearly bankrupted Hollywood in the 1970 's . One writer joked that EASY RIDER ( which was made for pocket change ) was the most expensive movie ever made because so many films followed which tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate its success . Sixtyish , once honored directors like Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger made movies like RPM and SKIDOO in an effort to attract a young audience . White directors and writers attempted to make films to attract a Black audience . Those movies are locked somewhere in a vault and the two named and many others from that genre have never , as best I know , been out on home video or cable . They 're the studios ' deep dark secret . Raquel Welch 's performance in this is , all things considered , very good . With the right direction and script she could played the type of sassy liberated women Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck specialized in . She looks great and has awesome costumes . Mae West is the liveliest seventy-something actress I 've ever seen . On the one hand it 's kind of heartbreaking to watch her attempt to capture her glory from years gone by , but I 'm sure she needed the money . If you want to see a big budget X-rated movie from this era check out BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS ( also from Fox ) because it doesn't take itself seriously . It 's crazy kids playing with the equipment at a major studio . MYRA BRECKINRIDGE tries to Say Something . There just wasn't anyone who wanted to listen .  
  I bought this DVD without any previous reference but the names of John Huston , Raquel Welch , Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on its cover . I found the Brazilian title very weird , but I decided to watch expecting to see a funny comedy maybe like " Switch " . However the non-sense story is awful and hard to be described . Myron Breckinridge ( Rex Reed ) is submitted to a surgery to change his sex in Copenhagen and he returns to Hollywood telling that she is to be Myra Breckinridge ( Raquel Welch ) and claiming half the property of his uncle Buck Loner ( John Huston ) . Along the days , Myra and her alter-ego Myron corrupt a young couple in her uncle 's academy with kinky sex . In a certain moment , the messy screenplay is so confused that I believe the whole story was only a mind trip of Myron induced by the accident . Unfortunately the beauties of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are not enough to hold this flick . My vote is three . Title ( Brazil ) : " Homem & Mulher Até Certo Ponto " ( " Man & Woman Up to a Point " )  
  I had high hopes for this movie , because I enjoyed the book so much . However , I don't think I would have understood the premise of the movie if I hadn't already read the book . The movie is a noble attempt to show the despair of people trying to break the bonds of overpowering government rule , but the book portrays the suffering much more thoroughly . The corrupt government officials have comfortable , almost luxurious lives , while the common people struggle to obtain the bare necessities for survival . Perhaps most people feel this way toward their leaders and rulers regardless of whether or not they are actually oppressed or repressed . Orwell 's dystopia seems as if it could exist in many places in our modern world . It has been several years since I 've read the book , but one hears references to Big Brother , the Thought Police , and Newspeak frequently in the media and casual conversation . Probably many people using these terms don't realize where the terms came from . I strongly recommend that you read the book .  
  I wasn't really fond of the first " Cube " movie . It was a good idea , but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much . Didn't really feel the need to see its sequel but when I heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original . I was intrigued , thinking that maybe they would fix some of the original 's problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters . Well I thought wrong . " Cube Zero " starts well enough by introducing us with the two characters in charge of watching and maintaining the never-ending maze of traps that plagues the people in the Cube . The filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two men 's daily routine . Several questions are created from it , concerning the reason why people are send there and also the true nature of the ones who run the entire operation . All of which are left entirely to the viewer . The acting was a bit weak but all in all the movie 's first half moved relatively well . With the story moving on , one of the two " watchers " begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing . And later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped . Here is where everything rapidly starts to dissolve into dull cheese . Sent by the people who run the Cube program we are introduced to the character " Jax " . Along with his two underlings play a major reason as to why this movie is failure . To start of " Jax " looks and talks more like a third rate villain taken directly from a James Bond movie complete with the ever " popular " glass eye , that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the first half 's relatively nice pace . Whats more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie . With some incredibly corny lines , perhaps the screenwriter got bored and didn't care . The acting itself degrades to a further low when the former " watcher " meets the group in the Cube . The entire interaction is painful to watch as is everything else following it . Again failing to impress on anything but weak characters , dialog and acting " Cube Zero " is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie .  
  i think this one sucked on ice , because it left the cube , and gave us to much information as to the who 's and why 's . The original CUBE never left the cube , and it left everything to your imagination . This crap fest however , gives you it all . and i didn't like it .. Though the acting is solid , I think the reason this one was a downer was because it was done by people other than the ORIGINAL filmmakers , if they had Vincenzo Natali do this prequel , or even the sequel i think it would have done better and would have been more true to the source . so i recommend you stay far , far away from this one , and HYPERCUBE , another movie i don't even want to discuss .. ( i gave it a 2 for the acting only )  
  THIS FILM IS LAME , LAME , LAME ! It takes a lot to bring me to over-exaggeration about a movie , but this movie stunk up my house ! I haven't even finished the movie yet and I had to stop to comment on how bad this movie is . I 'VE NEVER DONE THAT ! As a consumer , do not spend your money on this film . Wait until it comes out on a cable channel or something . It 's barely TV worthy . I REALLY HATE TRASHING A MOVIE , BUT THIS MOVIE IS TRASH ! Barely above porn . Should have and X rating ! Good plot , some frontal nudity ( if that floats your boat ) , but HORRIBLE high school level acting . Don't know how this movie received distribution . ( Must have been a contractual thing . ) Really , if you really like watching good movies , don't waste you time with this one . From one movie lover to another . YOU WILL BE MAD AT YOURSELF ! Let me say this as well , if you 've been through something like this perhaps you can relate and it will have some value for you . In that case I say watch it , you may take something away from it , if not just seeing something that 's happened to you being acted out by someone else ( has therapeutic value ) .  
  I 've never understood the appeal of Garbo . She always comes across in her films as stuck up , not all that alluring , and that annoying voice that could have drowned out the tuba section . She was also a very limited actress , like Gloria Swanson far better off left in the silent era . In this her last film , her performance is very average and even unassured . She tries hard but it all comes to nothing because the script is even worse than her acting . A would be screwball romcom that is never once believable and never gets off the ground ( even though Melvyn Douglas manages to get airborne in the skiing scenes , which are really the only amusing thing here ) . There was potential but the script fails in almost every department , wasting every actor in it . Douglas and Garbo had good enough chemistry together but this one isn't even a spot on Ninotchka , which I also found to be extremely overrated .  
  A noble effort , I guess , but ultimately a poor one . Before seeing this film , I felt " Bartleby , The Scrivener " was unfilmable . After seeing it , I still do . Unfortunately , I think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on , and they will be upset at the film 's needless revisions ( updating from 1850 to 1970 , moving from New York to London ) . Even the superb talents of Paul Scofield can't salvage what looks to me like a well meaning but misguided effort to film Melville 's metaphysical classic .  
  Slackers is just another teen movie that 's not really worth watching . Dave ( Devon Sawa ) , Sam ( Jason Segel ) and Jeff ( Michael C . Maronna ) are about to graduate from Holden University with Honors in lying , cheating and scheming . The three roommates have proudly scammed their way through the last four years of college and now , during final exams , these big men on campus are about to be busted by the most unlikely dude in school . The plot is very stupid and there 's no reason why to watch this unless your looking to shut off you brain for a little while . Slackers is just a predictable teen flick that really adds nothing new to the genre . The comedy in Slackers is either hit or miss but there 's no real true funny or original moment in the movie . Its really just a collection of gags and some are actually pretty funny . Though for every joke that works there 's at least eight more that don't . The screenplay is full of penis and breast jokes that some high school and college students may enjoy . Even if they do they probably won't remember this film after awhile as its not a very memorable comedy . Jason Schwartzman plays the freaky Ethan and after appearing in some good comedies he has stoop pretty low . Jaime King and Devon Sawa are the other main stars but they do a rather poor job in this film . This is directed by Dewey Nicks and this is his first film so you can't blame him too much . The funniest character was probably Laura Prepon though , she 's not in the movie very much . The film is very short at only 86 minutes long however , that may be too long for some people who don't really like this type of humor . Slackers isn't the worst film of 2002 but certainly is below average . When compared to other films in the genre there 's a lot better out there such as Not Another Teen Movie , American Pie and its sequels , Scary Movie 1 & 2 etc . So unless you have seen most of them and you 're looking for something new then Slackers might fit that bill but its better if you just watch something else . Rating 4.3/10 a below average teen comedy that 's worth skipping .  
  It was so terrible . It wasn't fun to watch at all . Even the scene where the girl is using a vibrator , even that 's not fun to watch in this movie . I say again , the scene where a girl is masturbating with a vibrator is not even fun to watch . Or maybe if that was the only part of the movie that you watched , just girl on couch using a vibrator . Maybe they should have just released that one scene in theaters , maybe then the movie would be enjoyable on a certain level . My advice , fast forward to that point , watch it , rewind the movie , watch it again , rewind , repeat . Maybe you could enjoy yourself for 2 hours that way . This movie ranks alongside I spit on your grave and Doom generation in the category of worst movies that I have ever seen .  
  Who actually created this piece of crap this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it is such a waste of time and money . I hate it how they create low budget sequels featuring D-Lister actors and a storyline so similar to the 1st one . I found this movie in the bargain bin sitting right next to Wild Things 2 and Death To The Supermodels for $ 2.99 what a fool i was to actually think that this could be good instead i watched in disgust as poor acting stereotypes ripped of the storyline and script from the 1st one . Whoever thought that this straight-to-video production was actually even a half decent film you must be on crackd or something because I think what pretty much most of the people who 've seen this film thinks WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP !  
  From the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful ' Cruel Intentions ' , and how flat it landed . You 'll also notice what a terrible choice they made by casting Robin Dunne as Valmont .. Then in the second scene , you meet the two best things in this movie , Amy Adams and Mimi Rogers as Kathryn and her mother . That is , if you can get past the fact that Kathryn wasn't blonde in the first film .. Then the movie goes on , you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago , and you notice Sebastian has already met an Anette in the past , here called Danielle , and a Cecile , here called Cherie .. How original is that for a prequel . Then it turns into a low budget ' Wild Things ' type of film with lots and lots of oh-my " twists " . As I mentioned , Robin Dunne was a very bad choice . Not that he is a bad actor , he 's good .. He just doesn't have the charisma Ryan did . Amy Adams , who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time , once again delivers . But with all the talent in the world , there is no way one could save this trash . As a whole , this " movie " feels like a ' Beverly Hills , 90210 ' episode . The score has been stolen from ' Cruel Intentions ' and ' Jawbreaker ' .. Yes , they used the score from JAWBREAKER .. Couldn't they at least leave that one alone ? ! You 'll want to pass this one . If you want more Cruel Intentions , watch Stephen Frears ' Dangerous Liaisons .  
  I have never posted a review before , but I had to do it for this film ! This film is SO bad , I found myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as kitsch or parody . But it ISN'T . It is truly , un-self-consciously BAD . This is a serious attempt that flops gloriously . Other reviewers have pointed out the film 's many flaws , so I 'll try not to repeat these , but I do urge you to see this film . Throughout it I was either speechless , literally gasping with disbelief , or rolling on the floor in hysterics . I haven't had so much fun watching a film in years . In fact , I 'm going to try to get all my friends to see it because it 's the kind of movie that needs to be shared . My favorite parts : - When Arthur auditions to be a go-go boy ( his dancing is unbelievable ) - The gratuitous nudity ( the director / leading actor just had to get a nude shot in ) - The preacher 's office with its cardboard and crayon rendition of Christ - Of course , the famous wedding scene with the palm trees and the forgotten rings ( what narrative function does this play ? ! ? ) - The ex-wife 's wrestling match with Ben to get possession of her gun - The detailed sequence wherein Arthur kills the preacher ; he apparently burns him up with this incredibly measly match - Yes , the gay religious-fanatic brother with his bleached hair and WeHo fashions - And , my favorite , the use of Joplin 's " The Entertainer " as the opening soundtrack and " Pachebel 's Canon in D Major " as the closing soundtrack ! - the list goes on and on - a MUST SEE !  
  Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10 . Sam Mraovich wrote , directed , stared , and produced this movie . Sam should have given his idea to a good writer , director , and left the acting to somebody who could act . this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production . there was nobody to tell him , " Sam this is bad , really bad " . Jamie Brett Gabel 's acting was the only good point , but he could have been so much better with a good director , and better actors to work with . This movie is so bad i think Sam Mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie ( twice ) . the acting and direction was so bad , this movie was turned into a comedy . you just had to laugh , and in the wrong places . A second good point .. this would make a great date movie . after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date !  
  I have watched some pretty poor films in the past , but what the hell were they thinking of when they made this movie . Had the production crew turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of making it , because you sure have to be brain dead to find any enjoyment in it . I am a fan of most genres and enjoy " shoot ' em up " games , but merging the daft scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unwatchable . As most have already said , there was hardly any script and the acting was weak . I won't waste my time describing it . Anyone who rates this film above 4 has to be part of the production company or Sega , or else they have a very warped concept of entertainment . I must say , I was more annoyed with the video shop , who gave this a thumbs up , which led me to rent it . Thank god I had a second film to watch to restore some of my faith in movies . Comic book guy would be right if he said " Worst movie ever " !  
  This is the only film I 've seen that is made by Uwe Boll , I knew that he is probably the worst director ever who always makes films based on video games also that " House of the Dead " is one of IMDb bottom 100 . But I still wanted to watch it because I 'm a huge fan of the game and I wanted to see what doe 's the film have that makes it so bad . After watching it I do agree that it is crap , the movie had no story . In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about ( for a moment there I was wondering are the zombies brain-dead ? or the girls are ? ) then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere & started attacking people later a woman started shooting them I mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes . Is it supposed to be a comedy ? , or horror ? or both ? Before I knew it I fell asleep at the second half & woke up during the end credits so I did not manage to watch all of it , which is a good thing ! The film is a true insult to the classic game , Uwe Boll please do not make any more films . Thank you !  
  This movie has received a lot of bad press from people who don't understand what it was meant to be . One must understand that this movie was never meant to be taken seriously . It 's camp , along the same lines as " Army of Darkness . " AoD was silly , but funny and bad in a good way . " House of the Dead " fails to be " good bad . " . There are qualities inherent in good campy movies , most important of those being believable fantasy . One needs to believe what 's happening in a movie to see the humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong . Without boundaries , the movie becomes absurd . HotD lacks any believability . Worse still , HotD brings nothing new to the genre , and repeats the same plot twists and character reactions that many horror movies inevitably start to exhibit . For example , all too often , horror movies fall into the trap where the main characters find love amongst the gore and destruction . I don't know about you , but when I 'm being chased by zombies , I wanna make out with a hot chick . Believe it ? No ? Then , you probably won't believe it when the characters start sucking each other 's faces in this movie . Beyond the obvious issues that plague this movie like so many other horror movies , Uwe Boll elected to add scenes from the video game of zombies being shot , randomly whenever a character shoots a zombie in the movie . Not only is there no clear rationale for this artistic choice , but it distracts one from an already unbelievable plot . Further , there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting , and seemingly no attempts by the director to guide the actors ' reactions to events .. leaving the movie with no redeeming qualities . Avoid ..  
  The subject matter seems pretty dated today . Adapted for TV from Rona Jaffe 's book ; we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence . Four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the board game Mazes and Dragons ( based on Dungeons and Dragons ) . One player , a young Tom Hanks , enters the fantasy world too deep . His co-players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted harm . David Wallace , Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace round out the game 's foursome . Support cast is made up of veteran actors like Murray Hamilton , Vera Miles , Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg . At this date , it seems lumbering and tame . But the highlight of watching is seeing Tom Hanks between his " Bosom Buddies " salad days and his big splash in SPLASH on the silver screen . The youngest of viewer will get most enjoyment .  
  Seriously . I just wrapped up my first viewing of Demonicus and words have failed me . I remember a time when I would see Charles Band 's name on a film and my heart would race . He was never a Wes Craven or a John Carpenter . He was a bastion of hope for the little man . The guy whose movies arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex , but they still rocked harder than most of the trendy junk we otherwise had to endure . And now .. this . A painfully-obvious Californian walking trail doubles for " the Alps " and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be " an ancient cave " . I mean , they didn't even try to dress the thing up with moss or film it in a way that might suggest it was anything other than an old train tunnel ! Ugh ! Instead of a creepy demon gladiator , as the cover implies , we 're treated to a dude wearing the latest in Wal-Mart Halloween apparel . There 's a pretty cool looking corpse , who occasionally comes to life to belch and wiggle his fingers , but he doesn't even learn to stand until the final five minutes . Why couldn't he be the villain ? Instead , we 've got frat boy Joe with a plastic sword . Ouch . Charles Band .. you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such tripe . I love movies that are so bad , they 're good . Hell , I occasionally enjoy a flick thats so bad , its just bad . This one , however , is just unwatchable . A perfect example of making a buck , rather than making a quality film .  
  The psychology of this movie is really weird to try and figure out . Its often billed as an anti-RPG movie , but its really not that simple . Here are come apparent contradictions that make me wonder just what ( if anything ) they 're trying to say about gaming . They laboriously introduce all the characters home lives by way of introduction , all of them having parents who are divorced , alcoholic , and totally out of touch with their lives except for the times they 're harshly pressuring them to succeed . Tom Hanks is arguably the worst off , having just failed out of another school and still dealing with a brother who disappeared and may be dead . Its mentioned a couple of times that they play the game to work through problems in their real lives . And sure enough , at the end , when they go to see Robbie ( Hanks ) , they 're all happy and well-adjusted , embarking on their adult careers , problems solved , games put away ( Daniel doesn't even want to design computer games any more ) , and even Robbie 's mother , who 's been constantly drunk and dissatisfied , is suddenly the Happy Homemaker , looking fresh and bright and arranging flowers . Sure , JJ suddenly ( and quite cheerfully it seems ) decides to commit suicide , but the reason seems to be entirely because he 's a lonely boy genius who can't get a date , and not because his character dies , as in the famous Jack Chick tract ( which happens afterward anyways , and it almost seems like he does it on purpose so he can end Daniels game and get everyone to come play his . In fact , the prospect of live-action role playing in the caverns seems to be the only thing that saves him from killing himself ! ) And in what may be the coolest tableau scene in the whole movie , Kate , looking very fetching in chain mail , looks right at the camera and says something like , " The scariest monsters are the ones in our own minds . " The biggest fantasy element in this movie is the two muggers passing up the rich couple so they can rob the dirty , homeless-looking guy of his magic beans . The recurring theme ( a " The Way We Were " for the 80s ) might have been poignant at the end , but as a way to kick off a movie is downright depressing and seems out of place . And for one final mystery , our hero , wearing full Pardu regalia , has a psychotic break , becomes his character completely and embarks on his quest , so of course the first thing he does is change into 20-century street clothes . So maybe the movie 's irrational , but I guess its dealing with an irrational topic . In those days a circle of kids with dice and pencils was regarded as tainted and possibly possessed , and you could go insane if they spoke their mumbo-jumbo at you . The anti-game paranoia is pretty much summed up in the first scene , where the reporter asks the cop whats going on , the cop says a kids lost in the tunnels and there 's a chance Mazes and Monsters is somehow involved . The reporter admits to being vaguely familiar with the game ( although he allows his own children to play it ) , then turns to the camera and reels off a polished spiel that blames the game for everything and admits no possibility of another explanation . In the end , its no masterpiece , but interesting as made-for-TV movies go .  
  A few weeks ago the German broadcaster " SAT1 " advertised this movie as the " TV-Event of the year " - sorry , but I 've seen better things on TV this year . I didn't thought much of the movie but I soon reminisced about two other horrible movies when I watched the commercial - namely Titanic and Pearl Harbor because the picture looked so familiar : The " heroine " ( if I can really call her that ) in the middle and her two " loved-ones " next to her - Pearl Harbor , anyone ? In fact the love-story is a poor man 's version of the one in Pearl Harbor and that one was already poor ! But as I like watching movies and analyzing their patterns I eventually decided to watch that rubbish . The movie begins with a doctor leaving his family for the military strike against Russia near the end of the Third Reich promising his wife that he will return . Now fast forward to Spring 1948 : Germany lost the war and the allies & Russia captured the country and they both try to eliminate each other for world power and their ideologies : capitalism versus communism . Well , I guess you already know the story because you have to know it - The movie doesn't really bother with it so much and literally takes a dump on historical facts . The movie tries to depict the US government as angels and completely ignores the contribution of other countries during the airlift especially Great Britain who was responsible for nearly a quarter of the rations despite having their country bombed from a country that they 're trying to help . What was also pretty annoying were the historical remarks the people said in the movie like when the heroine 's mother tells her daughter that Germany might be parted in two with a response like : " That 's impossible ! " Or when Stalin ( where the director thought we just stick similarly looking mustache on the actor and he WILL look like him ) says that Russia has to stop " Coca Cola " from spreading in Germany . Yeah right , if Stalin has ever said something like this . Or there is this one US pilot who tells his fellow of a bread with meat and everything possible in it - please ! Burgers were invented WAY before that time . In the movie you once see a map showing the airlines , funnily enough the map looks like it came straight out of a laser printer - in ' 48 . The US general Lucius Clay who 's main idea was to stay in Berlin is portrayed as a guy who is mean and grumpy and all the ideas he historically had like for example the airlift and improving on that idea came from the fictive character Phillip Turner , the love interest of the main actress which leads me to other aspects : Not enough African-American soldiers in the movie , there were like two in the whole film ! Also relationships between US soldiers and German civilians was not allowed and by a revealing of such a relationship the US soldier would 've been sent home . I don't want to say that there were no relationships at all but in this movie there was a couple that almost got married , If it wasn't for the death of the pilot in his fake CGI plane which looked terribly unrealistic especially the CGI fire ! If it wasn't enough all Americans in this movie spoke accent-free German although they only were in Germany for a couple of months - look I 'm also American living in Germany for my whole life and even I have a little accent . Notably bad was also the child acting - the kids had like two expressions on their faces : " Normal I look monotonous like a robot " and grinning . All in all the movie was boring from beginning to end moving way too slow especially the love story which was the same as the one in Pearl Harbor just with half of the dialogue . The sad part is that the movie was very successful - 8.97 millions watched the first part and 7.83 millions the second part the day after thus SAT1 receiving two consecutive wins in the overall market share and a whopping win in the commercial relevant group . But like I always think : The biggest pile of bull-crap is where the most flies go to .  
  Disappointing , predictable film in which a woman ( Mc Teer ) travels with her daughter from state to state because she can't maintain relationships and find happiness . In this genre ' Anywhere but here ' starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman gave a much better insight into a mother / daughter relationship . With Better acting as well .  
  Although i had heard this film was a little dry , I watch whatever Scott Bakula is in . At the start of this film I had high hopes for the classic cheesy but enjoyable Scott-gets-girl ending and until 20 minutes before the end it was going great . The plot twist was crazy and unexpected and very clever . I kept my fingers crossed that it would work out and it would all be some horrible misunderstanding , right up until when the credits rolled and I realised that there was not going to be a happy and contented ending . Unfortunately i was left regretting that i 'd watched it and hurriedly putting on some quantum leap to restore my faith in the goodness of the Great Scott !  
  This is a typical late Universal Horror flick : its technically comptent , if by the numbers , with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overacting . The most interesting part of this film is its stunt casting of Rondo Hatton , a man with a bone disease as the film 's " monster " . Its sad to see this man exploited , but he probably made good use of the money they paid him . Hatton is less horrifying than the studio hoped , as I more often felt pity over fear or even loathing . Martin Koslack is on board as the film 's mad artist , and he is very amusing in this part . I for one enjoy seeing Koslack in just about anything ; for some reason the man amuses me . The only other part of the film that entertained me is the film 's absurd take on the art world . Here we are shown evil art critics who revel in their ability to break artists ; this is side by side with the film 's male " hero " who is an " artist " who paints .. get this .. pin up girls . Somehow our hero 's work is reviewed side by side with the villan 's absurdist sculpture . Also amusing is the film 's chief nasty critic , who at one point claims that he despises the hero 's pin up art because " women like that don't exist " to which our heroine replies with an assurance that the critic just doesn't get out enough . Finally , there 's a bit of a subplot about the heroine 's ( who is an art critic herself ) domestication by the leading man .. completely anti-feminist and ridiculous to witness . Overall this film is a rather mediocre picture with a few amusing elements .  
  while watching this movie I got sick . I have been grewing up with Pippi and every time was a real pleasure . when my wife came to Sweden she was looking at the oldies and had a real good laugh . but this American version should be renamed and never be shown again . it is terrible from beginning to it 's end . how can they manage to make it soo bad . well I guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha .. but they are never close to Pippi . may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on a broadcast . burn the movie and save the kids . if you want to look at Pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh . WE LOVE PIPPI INGER NILSSON , sorry Tami Erin you will never stand up to be Pippi .. Oh yes .. when read the " spoilers " explanation , " ' spoiling ' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film . " well I guess the director stands for this .. you are looking at this movie at your own risk .. it is really a waste of time ..  
  This serial is interesting to watch as an MST3K feature , but for todays audience that 's all it is . I was really surprised to see the year it was made as 1952 . Considering that fact alone makes this a solid ( lowly ? ) 2 in my book . The cars used don't even look contemporary , they look like stuff from the 30 's . It 's basically Cody ( the lone world 's salvation ? Sheesh talk about an insult to everyone else , like the military ) , anyway it 's Cody in his nipple ring flying suit against Graber and Daley two dumb * ss henchman who sport handguns and an occasional ray gun thats pretty lame in its own right , enjoy . If you want to watch a really good serial see Flash Gordan , it 's full of rockets that attack each other and a good evil nemesis and also good looking women , this has NONE of that . And Flash was made 15 or so years before this crap so you can give it some slack . Something made in 1952 , this bad , deserves a 2 . Nuff said . give it a 6 if your watching it as a MST3K episode , those guys have some good fun with it ; a tweak of the nipples here , a tweak there and I 'm flying ! And now as an added bonus , I bring you the Commander Cody Theme song as originally sung by Joel and his two character bots Tom Servo and Crow aboard the satellite of love for episode eight The Enemy Planet : ( Singing at the very beginning credits ) ; ( TOM SERVO SINGING ) YOUR WATCHING COMMANDER CODY .. HE IS THE NEW CHARACTER FROM REPUBLIC , HE GETS IN TROUBLE EVERY WEEK .. BUT HE 'S SAVED BY EDITING , JUST A TWEAK OF HIS NIPPLES .. SENDS HIM ON HIS WAY , A PUMPKIN HEAD AND A ROCKET PACK .. WILL SAVE THE DAY , ( JOEL SINGING ) HIS LABRATORY IS A BOXING RING .. WHEN BAD GUYS COME TO MIX IT UP , SOMEBODY ALWAYS GETS KIDNAPPED .. AND CODY HAS TO FIX IT UP , HE DRINKS HIS TEA AT AL 'S CAFE .. AND FLIES ALONG ON WIRES , HE BEATS THE CROOKS AND FLIES WITH HOOKS .. AND PUTS OUT FOREST FIRES , ( CROW SINGING ) BAD GUYS BEWARE .. CODY IS THERE , YOU 'LL LIKE HIS HAIR IT 'S UNDER HIS HELMUT .. AND BECAUSE WE CAN'T THINK OF A GOOD RHYME , THAT 'S THE END OF THE COMMANDER CODY THEME SONG .. SO SIT RIGHT BACK WITH A WILL OF GRANITE , AND WATCH CHAPTER EIGHT , CAUSE THAT 'S THE ENEMY PLANET  
  Steve McQueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there . He certainly was a charismatic fellow , one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew . But even McQueen can't save this turkey of a film , shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual locations in St . Louis . McQueen 's a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang . There 's more than a broad hint that there 's a gay relationship going on between young Steve and David Clarke . He 's not liked at all by the other heist members , mainly because of his lack of criminal resume . Steve also has a girl friend in Molly McCarthy and she suspects something afoot , especially when he starts hanging around with Crahan Denton and James Dukas as well as Clarke , all pretty rough characters . That would certainly get my suspicions aroused . The Great St . Louis Bank Robbery had two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Stix . Guggenheim did mostly documentaries and Stix didn't do much of anything . One of those two jokers decided Steve 's performance was best served by doing a bad Marlon Brando imitation . This film may go down as the worst ever done by Steve McQueen . I 'm willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions had already signed him for Wanted Dead or Alive because I can't believe they would have if they saw this . Or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey .  
  Just about everything in this movie is wrong , wrong , wrong . Take Mike Myers , for example . He 's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his SNL days , over ten years ago . He 's doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices . His Cat is painfully unfunny . He tries way to hard . He 's some weird Type A comedian , not the cool cat he 's supposed to be . The rest of the movie is just as bad . The sets are unbelievably ugly - and clearly a waste of millions of dollars . ( Cardboard cut-outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street . ) Alec Balwin tries to do a funny Great Santini impression , but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent . There 's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity Paris Hilton - that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a Dr . Seuss story . Avoid this movie at all costs , folks . It 's not even an interesting train wreck . ( I hope they 'll make Horton Hears a Who with Robin Williams . Then we 'll have the bad-Seuss movie-starring-spasitc - comedian trilogy . )  
  This movie looked like it was going to be really funny . I was very excited to see it but was very disappointed . It was very unrealistic . The plot was also pretty weak . I was expecting it to be really funny but the jokes weren't even that good . I was also really disappointed with the ending . I would not recommend this movie to anyone .  
  I suppose many people comment / review their first movie on IMDb because the movie was spectacular or horrible - I 'm writing due to the latter . I was excited for the sequel to " Wargames " .. I thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content , I felt it was worth watching more than once . This being 2008 , I had high hopes for what they would do with this film . Computers , Gaming , Terror , Military over-zealousness have all grown so much since the time of the first film , and " Wargames : The Dead Code " had an opportunity to bring it all into a great flick . The movie failed on pretty much every level , but I particularly blame the writers and anyone who had any input regarding the realism of gaming aspects . " The Dead Code " was a 1990 's air flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms . Meanwhile , Will Farmer is button mashing about 7,000 commands - none of which are impacting what is happening on the screen . Until finally he " wins " by clicking a box on the screen with his mouse that release gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people ( nobody is near the gas ) . Because he beat 5 LEVELS in 15 minutes , this tells RIPLEY ( the real life war machine ) that he is a high level terror threat . Even though any 5-16 year old could complete this same task - The government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity . They say things like " He has expert knowledge of bio-terror " .. He displayed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the Wiki entry on Bio-Terror . So then a movie-long chase scene with about . 01 % of the budget and excitement of any of the Bourne titles ensues . They have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clear up the entire matter .. sometimes they are mad they barely miss him .. but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally to follow him . Ugh .. I would write more .. but I already wasted 1.5 hours watching this , I would rather watch the Broderick and Joshua play tic-tac-toe for 1.5 hours .  
  If you thought that the original from 83 was bad then try out this modern day masterpiece . How could it be worse more you ask ? Well .. at least in the first one you had Ally Sheedy jogging in a sports bra . Other than updated graphics , modern day themes ( such as terrorists ) , modern weapons and a sexy new voice for Ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story . Anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line in the story was going . And for anyone that didn't see the first one .. well consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once . Maybe in another 23 years Hollywood will try again .  
  Not totally off the wall in a good way , but just totally stupid . " Killer Tongue " is an uneasy mixture of sci-fi , horror , and supposed comedy . What this equates to is a mindless and totally incoherent film . There is very little dialog , mainly due to the fact that the script , if there was one , is complete " pond scum " . I wouldn't even call it strange , more like just " total nonsense " . This movie is certain to disappoint , and you have been warned . There is absolutely no reason to waste time on this , and if you do , the pungent smell will linger like rotten fish .. MERK  
  Judging by some of the comments in IMDB , I was expecting an action movie - perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple one or a comicy one , but essentially an action movie . Whatever it is that I watched , it certainly didn't feel like a movie . The story is simple and straightforward ( even though the prologue tries to make it seem complicated ) . Take three interest groups : 1 ) the government 2 ) the rebels 3 ) a group of assassins . Now subtract the first ( they never appear in the movie ) . Then simply let one of the assassins , the princess , become a rogue on a revenge trip . Add in a rebel love-interest with a guilty conscience . And you 've got the ingredients . But they still did not manage to turn it into a story or a movie . Between some random action sequences and some odd visuals trying to be Sci-Fi on a low budget , what you 're left with is a feeling of emptiness . The movie just does not feel like a movie , but a weird , incoherent , boring dream . Avoid . 2/10  
  Below average movie with poor music considering a movie based on music ? Ordinary Script & Direction with full of blunders . Salman Khan was at his usual acting . Ajay 's performance deteriorating with time as his looks , especially his styles as a Rock Star were pathetic . Asin was just a showpiece only . Overall I felt like wasting my money in cinema . Salman Khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan . There were many songs in the movie all boring except " Man Ko Ati " . The Most Important Song to impress the UK Music Sponsor was most unimpressive . " Khanabadosh " can be very easily understood by an English Music Sponsor . The other movie I saw last week was " Wake Up Sid " which was simple slow love story with good direction & acting despite average music  
  Maan , where do i start with this god awful movie . Bad bad bad story telling . I do not know what the director was thinking when he made this movie . Namaste London was quite an enjoyable movie to be honest .. even the soundtrack was good . But in this one .. oh my good .. for a movie which is supposed to be a musical one .. the songs are soo bad . AR Rahman should have been the music director . Given two great actors a much better job should have been done by the director . Even though the first half sucks , the last 30 mins of the movie are OK . Performances from Salman and Ajay save the movie from being a total disaster . Watch it if you have nothing better to do . The last good movie from Bollywood i watched ( and i do watch a load of them ) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid .  
  Interesting ? Hardly . The ' scientific evidence ' the movie provides for its point ( which is basicly that Jews are a cancer ) is so stupid and lame , it 's almost laughable ( if we didn't know what happened in that era ) . Important ? Nah . I can't imagine Germans ( even at that horrid time ) would like or believe this movie . Compare it to Riefenstahl 's Triumf des Willens . Now that was I movie I was impressed with . This is just silly garbage . ' Best ' part is a scene from M ( one of my all-time favorites ) where ( the jew , as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us ) Lorre plays a child-molester and murderer . In the eyes of these film-makers , only a depraved mind can do so . Uh-huh . Didn't know M was Hitler 's favorite movie , right ? No , it 's just plain STUPID . Even for it 's nazi-propaganda genre . 2/10 .  
  Greenaway 's films pose as clever , erudite and innovative . Yet his style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the World War 1 era of film-making : the frame composition , use of mid-shot , the static camera . It may be well to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it is not new . Perhaps like that other " innovator " , TS Eliot , he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could . Yet Greenaway 's biggest failing is that he cannot write . His dialog and even plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logician , Brecht . Where this weakness is most apparent is in his humor , which is poised and logical , so the joke is dead before it 's delivered . The result is tedium : if it 's not funny , it has failed : ask a stand-up comedian to justify their act if the audience doesn't respond . Perhaps the well-read director could learn something from Freud on humor . Finally , like Woody Allen , Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones . They speak the lines with a bored , smug air like narcissistic adolescents . This film , despite its design and lighting , is meretricious .  
  I saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the makings of a family joke . If the ranking had a zero , this movie would get it . The dinosaurs were awful . The storyline was ridiculous . The acting really doesn't qualify to be called acting . The only reason I even remember the name of the movie so well is because my family still talks about how BAD it really was .  
  Posh Spice Victoria Beckham and her alleged new adventures after just moving to LA for work purposes ( footballer hubby David is now a Galaxy LA player after his transfer from Real Madrid ) was originally going to be a full series , but was thankfully abridged to just one hour or so . But even in this form , it is still numbingly interminable . Like virtually all ' reality ' TV shows , most of the incident comes across as blatantly faked , with the programme itself even admitting that Posh 's newly appointed personal assistant is an actress . An Ugly-Betty lookalike , we hear some lamely written and performed banter early on ( with an obvious joke about Becks ' apparent dalliance with a previous , and rather more glamorous PA Rebecca Loos , though her name is not mentioned ) with further sequences involving a fake blow-up doll to trick the paparazzi and hopeless attempts to pitch a baseball . This could have been more entertaining if all had acknowledged it was a piece of fluff , and had an actress or impersonator in the lead role . Talented impressionist Ronni Ancona would 've been perfect and is better at being Posh than Posh herself is , and if this more sensible decision had been taken , much more fun and amusement would 've ensued . Sadly , we are left with the real thing here ( Ms Ancona may have rejected the script as too weak anyway ) , and although there are odd scattered attempts at self-deprecation and irony , it never remotely works because of prior info of La Beckham 's considerable wealth beforehand , and her non-ability at delivering would-be jokes ; despite the intentions to send up her image , Mrs Beckham comes across as a shallow egotist , and her weak one-liners don't persuade us she has any humorous self-awareness . I suspect that if a more realistic fly on the wall documentary approach had been taken , namely Posh walking down any street in LA and being totally ignored ( instead of the frantic , staged scenes of mild hysteria on show here ) , and associates making unscripted jibes about the previously mentioned Ms Loos , this would 've made marginally better TV , but being sycophantic PR material , the bony one herself would never allow such events to happen . Having said that , the later scenes where she made a special appearance at the baseball stadium where she was indifferently presented in front of an uninterested crowd show it will be tough times ahead if she wants to make it big in Hollywood . Her colleague Scary Spice ( aka Mel Brown ) also found it impossible to make it big residing in the movie capital despite her affair ( which was not consummated ) with big name Eddie Murphy . The Spice Girls were of course a massively successful bubblegum pop group in the mid 1990 's , more so in their native Britain but still popular briefly in other countries , including the US . They were certainly good fun at their peak of glory ( 1997 ) when there seemed to be a glorious period of optimism in the UK with Cool Britannia and a New Labour government which The Spice Girls seemed to sum up better then anyone else at the time , even if it was somewhat manufactured . But they were never outstanding musical or singing talents , and UK optimism seemed to fade rapidly later that year ( the starting point was arguably the tragic death of Princess Diana ) , as did The Spices ' themselves . Their presence on the music and entertainment scene soon became repetitive and obvious , and if they had all quietly moved out of the public eye permanently with dignity to enjoy their fortunes , then we would have all had pleasant memories encrypted on our mind without any guilt . Unfortunately , the emergence of the hideous ' celebrity ' culture in the UK towards the start of the millennium has put paid to those imaginings , and we have all suffered thousands , if not millions of stories about the Spices since , Posh being the worst offender , with the rest of her colleagues not too far behind . It was recently announced that there will be a reunion tour soon , which is baffling as they have never gone away and they certainly don't require any additions to their swelling bank accounts . Maybe it 's because two of them are struggling single mothers , perhaps ? Good , it 's soon time for Becks ' adventures on a revelatory documentary next , I can hardly wait .. Rating : 2 out of 10 .  
  I am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many , but this was simply not a very good attempt . Its got nothing to do with comparisons with the British original - have not seen , and doubt I will . It has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot , lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance / character from its supposed male lead ( Jimmy Fallon ) . Fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that . He 's supposed to be a teacher you see , and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach . The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable , but old reliables like John Cusack or Adam Sandler might have been able to give it a shot . Not Fallon , who is neither funny , nor an actor , but appears to think he is both . Not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe Fallon in his role , or believe that there is any way these two people should , or would be together . Near the end of the movie there is a scene where Barrymore ( who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone - its hard to have a one person romance ) tells Fallon that its over , too much has happened , and she 's moving on . And rather than feeling bad about the scene , or sorry for Fallon , you are actively cheering her on - finally she does what she should have done months ago . But of course the plot mechanics won't allow that to be the end of it ( an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess ) , and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions . Its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying , but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else .  
  Seems everyone in this film is channeling Woody Allen . They stammer and pause and stammer some more . Only for REALLY die-hard DeNero fans ! It tries to appear as edgy and artistic - but it comes off as looking like a very , very low budget film made by college students . The most often used word in the whole film is " hum " . The film does peg the atmosphere of the late sixties / early seventies though . If you like films where people are CONSTANTLY talking over each other , horrible lighting ( even if it is for " art 's sake " ) , and makes you feel like you are sitting in on a lame political meeting , then you might like this - but you need to be really bored . I found this CD in the dollar bin and now I know why .  
  Discovery Channel / Animal Planet must be ashamed of themselves . This Fantasy is modeled after the " Walking with Dinosuars " series . Even though this is 100 % fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way . Even mixing the fantasy dragons with T-rexs and the extinction of the dinos . Added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say Sci-Fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show . On its own the show is about an 7.5/10 far as entertainment goes . But the way in which it is presented I have to give it a 1/10 . Don't get me wrong I have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong . I can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real . I also think this weakens the great " Walking with Dinosuars " series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini-series .  
  Fantastic Mr . Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book . Wes Anderson directs , and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film . While I respect what Anderson , an incredibly talented man did , the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit . Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man , and if this happened to be a bad film , it would be his first bad film . Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day , this is Anderson 's first bad day in film making , so I am going to let him off easy . I will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it , and the animation is nice , but the film gets progressively harder to get into , leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening . The characters are good , also . Jason Schwartzman voices Mr . Fox ( George Clooney ) ' s smart ass son , Ash , and especially engaging . The film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness , but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along . I 'm sure Wes Anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film , but for now , I 'm sorry , Wes Anderson , this film of yours was a big disappointment .  
  There are exactly 2 good things to be said about " Fantasies " ( both mentioned by a previous reviewer as well ) : a ) Bo Derek 's extraordinary , poetry-inspiring beauty . She has shots in this movie where she gives even Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for her money , and that 's a high compliment indeed . Her nudity is brief and discreet , but just looking at her face is enough . b ) The Greek island setting , with its sun and crystal-clear blue waters . Other than that , there is no story , the dialogue is abysmal and at times unintentionally funny ( " He touched you where you 're a woman ! " ) , and Peter Hooten 's character is a slimy jerk . Bo overplays the naivete of her character , but then again when you have to work with dialogue this bad it 's unfair to blame the actors ( the fact that she kept saying the name " Damir " in almost every sentence is a major irritation ) . Oh , and although the film is set on a Greek island , there is hardly a Greek word to be heard - apparently everyone there , from kids to old people , speaks English the whole time . ( * )  
  " Dutch Schultz " , AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer , was a real person and his rather nasty life is fairly well documented . This movie which purports to depict his life should have used a fictional character , because the overdramatized events are too strong a departure from the facts and the chronology . Not only that , it ignores some interesting details which other versions have included such as the public relations fiasco in upstate N.Y. and his religious conversion . It is true that he was executed by Luciano , Lansky , et . al . but that 's as far as it goes . The exploding plate scene which represents Luciano carrying out the execution of Bo Weinberg in his own home , assisted by his own mother is rediculous . Also , there is the scene in which Dutch approaches his own mother to pay protection to Legs Diamond . It just doesn't work . The character of Mrs . Fleggenheimer doesn't work either . This movie does not need a doting Jewish mother for comic relief . The lame representation of Legs Diamond was humorous enough . I 'm sure the man is turning in his grave . And , by the way , Dutch did in fact personally kill people , but , he was not Rambo or 007 . The scene in which he wipes out the brewery is absurd . I don't know . Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and I just didn't get it .  
  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! I saw it at the Toronto film festival and totally regret wasting my time . Completely unwatchable with no redeeming qualities whatsoever . Steer clear .
