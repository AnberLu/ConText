  This once available product has served me well . Very dynamic , universal in use , and user friendly . What more could be asked of a simple battery backup system that doesn't cost hundreds of $ . I 'm looking for the replacement because it 's best duty is under every critical user 's computer .  
  it was a fast shipping , good quality product but isn't what I need , I buy it by the picture , and the picture isn't from the product .. shame , waste of money .. and time ..  
  Purchased this to use during our county search and rescue missions and to play with doing some geocashing . Does a great job and really like the electronic compus . Would be nice if it didn't cost so much to add the extra maps but for now it is OK .  
  Very responsive . Perfect for the feeling of writing with a pen . I us it for all my note applications , several drawing apps as well . Perfect accessory for any touch screen . Love having the option of good ole pen and ink in one compact design when necessary . The clip on the cap is strong I clip it to my pocket book so it is always handy . The length fits my hand very comfortably as well . The white color also compliments my iPad . Perfect !  
  Solid construction . Not sure I can tell the difference yet for this Cat6 vs the Cat5e cable I had lying around , but certainly nothing wrong with this .  
  The letters are pretty sharp on black keyboard and the rest of the squares are very clear . What else is there to say about little pieces of vinil ?  
  Easy set up and great connection . Do keep in mind that your speed is greatly diminished ( about 40 % slower ) if you don't have USB 2.0 . Otherwise , it 's a great , stable device . Also , D-Link has a website with excellent support documentation . And if that 's not enough , they also offer free tech support over the phone .  
  I hooked up my PC with my Onkyo HT-RC370 Receiver to transfer the vedio to TV screen . It worked nicely for about 5 days . I did not change resolution and made any modifications , but after about one week , my receiver indicated there was no signal from my PC and the TV screen was blank blue . I rebooted my computer , the Windows logo appeared for couple of seconds on my TV screen , but turn to blank blue screen again when the PC is up running . This problem was not due to my Receiver because when I connected my PC directly with TV , the same thing happened .  
  Massive storage capacity ! My old original 30GB hard drive died on me . This replacement was the best option for me . I am a graphic artist & an amateur photographer . The need for more hard drive space needs no further explaining . Extremely inexpensive and easy to install , just unplug the old one and plug in the new one and presto ! Start loading it up !  
  It 's what I expected out of a FM transmitter . What sets this apart is the USB charger feature , making it easy to charge my phone and play music at the same time . the signal has trouble in big cities though , even on unused frequencies . Also listen to the instructions when it says put player volume to 2/3 , otherwise you will get significant distortion .  
  It 's a simple item , but it 's great for taking portraits or any time you need to put the camera on a tripod / keep it perfectly still . It 's small , so you can hide it in your hand while taking a self protraint and it clips to the camera strap so you 'll never lose it . Very happy with it .  
  I had an old computer without a USB port , so this was the perfect solution . It even came with all the software I needed . The installation instructions were easy to follow .  
  For someone who wants to start taking great pictures , this turned out to be great camera ! I like how Canon has divided the dial into pre-set and creative zones so you can select to take a quick picture or use the easy programming feature to capture the scene the way you want . For example , you can select the shutter speed and it will select the correct aperture automatically . That makes it a lot easier for people who are not professional photographers . The best part is that by turning the dial to the green box I can use it as a point and click for those run-of-mill quick pictures . Its a regular Jekyll and Hyde , this one ! On the downside , a beginner like me had real trouble figuring out how to take great pictures using the manual that came with the camera . I found that the $ .. for the CANON EOS Rebel 2000 book by Heiner Henninges and Bob Shell was well worth it . If you are not quite conversant with Canon SLRs spent the extra few bucks and you will really enjoy using the great features of this camera .  
  I just got this after getting a full sized wireless keyboard and mouse . I chose this because it resembles a laptop keyboard with the touch keys I 'm used to . This is my test run and it works as expected . The touch pad does what it is suppose to do . I like the very light footprint on my lap and the fact it comes with a dust protector . Since I use my laptop for everything from business to entertainment this item does a great great job and have no complaints .  
  I 'm old-school about my music . I want to accurately re-produce whatever the sound engineer mastered in the studio . That means Hi-Fi , which means big-heavy speakers with flat , accurate response through the audio range . The trouble is , that making these types of systems is really expensive . It 's much cheaper to put a fat , flabby subwoofer and some tinny tweeters into some cheap plastic boxes and advertise it as ' better ' because it has a subwoofer . When I listen to the majority of stereo systems ( pc or loungeroom ) I 'm horrified by the soggy , overpowering bass , harsh tinny treble , and either no midrange at all or worse , midrange overpowered by the resonant frequency of the plastic speaker housing . Sadly , I think that gen-Y have gotten used to this as being the pinnacle of audio reproduction ( never having heard REAL hi-fi ) . I was , therefore , shocked and delighted to hear some REAL hi-fi from the Z-10 's . This is exactly what I want out of a great speaker - accurate reproduction of the original music . Every time I listen to them I 'm impressed , every note in the range expressed exactly as intended . A truly rant-worthy product ;)  
  Don't worry about the lack of a picture - this is the battery you need to replace your Uniden BT-446 . It is an exact size replacement with the proper connector . It comes in retail ( card / blister ) packaging .  
  I have two pairs of these speakers . One set hooked up to my PC and one set hooked up to my PS3 and Xbox 360 . If you hate having to deal with a subwoofer or just dont want the kind of bass that makes the neighbors or parents mad , but you love deep bass , than these are your speakers . From CS source to WoW to UT3 on the PC . Or Battlefield BC2 ( war tapes ) to COD Modern Warfare 2 to Need for Speed Shift on the Xbox 360 . Or even Final Fantasy 13 to Motorstorm to KillZone 2 to Tekken 6 to God of War 3 on Playstation 3 . These speakers do amazing things to these games and so many more . Nothing can describe how awesome these speakers are in war tapes sound mode on BC2 . The bass in these speakers are just right . From explosions , to gun shots even footsteps are well done . They dont overkill on the small stuff ( foot steps ) , but are just right on the big stuff ( explosions ) ! They perform just as well with music and blu ray movies . I watched 300 using these speakers , one word came to my mind - Amazing . Perfect speakers at the right price .. Subwoofer sound , without the sub !  
  I spent months trying to get the crappy company that sold me my zoom lense to help me figure out how to attach it to my camera . The pieces they sold me didn't work . Finally I went to Frys and they told me I needed a 37mm to 52mm ( I think those are the sizes ) adapter to fit between my lense and the tube that fits onto my camera . They didn't sell them so they referred me online and I found this Raynox ring . It works perfectly and I it arrived days before my cuise where I put the zoom lense to good use !  
  This is a great purchase to match the DSC-T30 Camera . It screws in the tripod mount , looks great and protects the camera well .  
  I purchased my 30gb iPod a little under a month ago and have used it extensively ever since . Over the short , but generous time I 've interacted with my iPod , I 've come to notice things I love about it , and some things that irk me , but in the long run , don't take away the value that this iPod holds . Pros : - Navigation is very easy . Menus are available with a flick of the finger and there 's a place for everything and everything is in it 's place . - Storage . With 30gb , I can hold about 7,500 songs . Imagine , hundreds of compact discs stored all in one , small machine . - When I ordered my 30gb video iPod , I was worried about the size . For some reason , I remember it being fairly large [ which it never was , just my imagination ] , so when I actually received it , I was stunned . It 's large enough that photos and videos are good for viewing , but it 's slim and portable enough to slip into your pocket . - Someway , somehow Apple created brilliance in the sync relationship these iPods holds with iTunes . I can't explain , it just does . It does . Upload a CD , a couple songs , whatever and plug your iPod in , and it 's on it . - On topic with iTunes , I love how simple it is to create playlists , several for that matter . - There are many singular features that I take pleasure from my iPod with . * The quality of pictures is surprisingly clear for such a small device . Don't let the size fool you now . It 's slim but does it 's job and a good one at that . * The backlight on the screen is nice and bright and can be set to turn of after various increments of time . * I found the chrome back of the iPod to be an easy , on the run mirror . I 'm sure we females would enjoy that more so . * The look itself is well known throughout the world . Slim , sleek and classy . * I love the fact that I can play games , most times while listening to my music . And being able to purchase other games via iTunes is great . Those games entertain me greatly . Of course , there 's always two sides to most things . And , lo and behold , there are some cons to such a product . Cons : -I found the battery life to be my main one . After reading it can last up to 14 hours and only getting about 4 hours max out of mine , I was a bit dejected but after reading into it more , I realized that is because I do active things on my player such as games and photos . Basically , I guess that 's to be expected . - While this isn't necessarily a ' con ' as much as it is wishful thinking , I really hoped there would be a sleep timer as I find those especially useful . -I dislike the fact that the only way to charge it is through a computer , unless you pay for an adapter , which I haven't just yet and the fact that one isn't included . - Speaking of connecting to the computer , it doesn't recognize my iPod half the time . When I go to disconnect it , my iTunes freezes and my computer won't eject it . I 'm not sure if this is my computer , the player , or both . - On a similar note , my player sometimes gets a mind of it 's own . While it 's pretty much always cooperative , if it 's on a low battery , it takes a while to turn on and when connecting to my computer , it shows various screens and takes about 10 minutes to actually return to normal . - As for scratches , I 've really had none , so far . I would still advise you to invest in a case , as the one included is nothing more than a default one . One thing my iPod is prone to is fingerprints . Those little devils like to stick . Seeing as that 's not anything major and can be corrected with a case , I let it pass . As many cons as it may look like I 've written , I still enjoy my iPod very much and think I made a wise investment . The mechanical glitches I 've encountered don't take away from my iPod , just make it , well , a little more interesting at times . I wouldn't trade it for the world . An iPod essentially is for music . It 's got that and beyond , and that is why I have found it to be wonderful .  
  If you 're a frequent traveler , these will help you retain your sanity . I looked at the Bose ones , but couldn't justify the 2x price . The Audio-Technica work great and the price was more attractive than others .  
  A lot of hype for what it is : poorly made and pretty useless .  
  I plug in to a couple lower-end Bose computer speakers . I have serious hearing loss at 61 years old . For the first time in years I can listen to music and enjoy full sound . I can watch a movie and not bother my living partner with the excessive volume . I can't imagine how these must work for a normal hearing person , I love them ..  
  This antenna works great for local digital channels . I 'm only abour 10 miles from the towers , so the reception is fantastic - even with it mounted IN the attic ! Mounting it outdoors should also get great reception at further distances , but for anything over 20 miles , I 'd probably get their larger antenna ( same type ) . The best thing was there was virtually no assembly required with this antenna . It took me less than 10 minutes total to remove my old antenna and install this one . I 'm extremely satisfied with this product !  
  Do not buy this television . I purchased my TV in 12/07 after a few years of waiting for HDTV to become more affordable . $ 1700 was a lot of money , but foolish me thought the spluge would at least be worth it in the long run . My Toshiba , 32 inch stereo televison , that I " splurged " on in 2003 is still working with everyday use in my bedroom , but not my Samsung HDTV.I searched the internet and found out that one of the probelms that seemed to fit was that the television was manufactured with underrated capacitors . I purchased 2 new capacitors and replaced the old bulging ones . That worked for about 3 months and then the lines of dots started to come back . It is intermittent now . Sometiimes there is no visible problem , other times the dots will appear when I first turn it on , but if I turn off and back on , they 'll be gone and the TV will be fine for a few days . I think it is horrible that you can spend so much money on a television that doesn't provide more than 3 years of useful life . I wish I could attach a picture . Do not buy this television and be suspect of any other Samsung model .  
  I pre-ordered the DRX9000 and waited almost 3 months for delivery . Setup of the machine was easy . Thats where the fun stopped . I used a secondary AV source for the input . And again connection instructions were well-detailed and easy to follow . I purchased the DRX9000 originally because of the some 11 formats it would be able to read and play . I could only get the machine to play audio CDs . It was totally incapable of playing any DVD of any format . One of three things happened : 1 . the machine froze and locked ; 2 . the TV monitor was cleared of picture ; or 3 . the machine displayed the word ' Hello ' in the display and froze . In all three cases the only solution was to unplug the machine . The freezing occurred continually . The machine would freeze within 5 minutes of starting any DVD . If you attempted to select a title or use FastForward it would immediately freeze when Play was selected . The remote did little . Its basic functions did not perform and it kept displaying ' invalid ' on the tv monitor . I never attempted to copy or use the write / rewrite features . I boxed it up within 24 hours and shipped it back . Save yourself time and money and try a different manufacturer .  
  This monitor has a truly amazing picture at 1600x1200 , and the colors are great , too . With DVI , the picture is very stable and quite beautifulHOWEVER : If you are a hardcore gamer , pass this one up . Many people may disagree with this , but for me the ghosting is too noticeable and it is distracting and can actually detract from your gameplaying . For instance , if you play Unreal Tournament 2004 online , you need to be able to rotate the camera all the time while still retaining the ability to discern motion in the distance ( say , an enemy running at you ) . With this monitor the ghosting is just too much and it can seriously hinder your playing . However , everything else about it is good as far as LCDs go . For me , I am going to return this monitor and go with a ViewSonic 22 " CRT instead . It 's half the price and offers just as good a picture quality in my opinion . Plus , I like being able to run my monitor at any resolution without having to worry about interpolation . And , I 'll say it again - for me ghosting is a show stopper . Here 's a small experiment : try tracking the mouse pointer with your eyes in windows while moving it at various speeds . On this monitor is blurs easily . On a CRT it doesn't . If you are a gamer - stay away . For this price you can get a CRT that will blow this LCD out of the water . However , other factors such as the ergonomics of this monitor are pretty good ..  
  im very happy with this seller this is the second time i have ordered from cameta camera and ive have been very happy with the speed of the shipping and delivery the products are as described and are all brand new as stated i will recomend this place to all web buyers and i actually called and placed my order and the people i spoke to was very friendly and they knew what they were doing great place to buy from  
  I just love my Nikon Coolpix 3100 ! It does everything it says it should and I have had no problems with it . I was able to buy a large memory card for fairly cheap and have been taking tons of pictures ever since the day I bought it . We used to have a Kodak Easyshare , and to tell you the truth , my husband never saw what was easy about it . Perhaps it was too easy ! This little camera takes great pictures , the zoom is just right . I would suggest this camera to anyone who just wants it for nice family and friends candids .  
  I was shopping for a lightweight , inexpensive pair of " behind the head " headphones . That 's just what I received . As advertised , absolutely satisfied .. The one issue , which seems common to all behind the head headphones is that the band gets in the way at times . It would be great if this was adjustable so that it could be made to fit the individual . Unfortunately , that would likely increase the weight , which was an important factor in why I chose this particular model .  
  So , I 've had my creative zen : vision for several years now - since they first came out , and I have never stopped loving it . I had started out with an ipod as it was the thing to have at the time ( and still is , sadly ) and I was not at all impressed . My ipod died every three months like clockwork , so I gave up on it and went out and bought this . Best choice I ever made . This thing has been dropped in water , hurled across a room ( quite by accident ) , and dropped on every surface imaginable more times than I can count . ( I do try to take care of my expensive electronics , but mp3 players have a way of finding their way out of my pocket when I 'm running / exorcising ) Because of this abuse , the face has come off and has to be kept on by duct tape .. but the thing still works beautifully ! And when it does freeze ( which isn't often ) it has a handy little reset button that fixes everything . ( my ipod was forever freezing and it 's hold the buttons down reset method usually didn't work ) It has scratches , dings , scrapes but I love the thing and I 'll be very sad when I do have to replace it . I would recommend this mp3 player to anyone , it 's quite the gem .  
  A must have product for every individual that is connected to Computers in the daily life . Carry huge data files in your pocket without feeling an ounce of load on you . Great for sharing picures , videos , and Books with your friends and co-workers ! Great Price too !  
  Great product , but I 'm not crazy about the touch finger scroll . Overall , great product  
  This hard drive enclosure is fantastic . I was slightly concerned with reviews saying that the enclosure did not dissipate heat efficiently , but decided to take a chance on it . I had this thing running for close to 5 hours backing up my macbook pro , transferring more than 500 gigabytes of data . I continually checked the enclosure , and it never got more than a little warm to the touch . The build quality is impeccable , and having no issues with this product . I would highly recommend this product to a friend .  
  I love my Dymo LetraTag label maker so much so of course I need refills for it often ! These labels are awesome ! Make my house all neat and organized , just the way I like it !  
  I thought that it was & # 34 ; another flash more & # 34 ; . I was wrong , It is a excellent flash for Canon EOS . Incredible 400 flashes with 4 alcaline bateries only .  
  For the price of these headphones , they are pretty awesome . They are best for vocals and listening to music cleanly . Though I have not bought other headphones , listening to music on these headphones allows me to pick up on the breathing and other things that usually go unnoticed on conventional earbuds . They do lack some bass and have a ultra-long phone-type cable though . These are pretty comfy in my opinion and do get a little warm on your ears / tight after half an hour . But you just need to take them off for a few seconds and you can wear them again !  
  Excellent unit , it is very compact , and the mounting was easier than standard door opener . I replaced a standard rail , belt drive door opener with this unit to maximize ceiling height for a car lift installation . This unit is so quiet and efficient , I plan on replacing the other garage door unit with this Jackshaft unit . The new electronic opener with clock , temp , and motion detector light , are just added bonus 's I was not expecting . I highly recommend this LifMaster and I am a throughly satisfied customer .  
  I 'll admit that I purchased the Swingyde based on the reviews i read . Bad mistake . I play golf at least once a week . In my opinion this is priced 25 bucks too much . It mainly helps you hinge your wrist on the back swing and nothing else . There is SOO much more to a golf swing than hinging your wrist ! My opinion - pass on this product and get some lessons - preferably an instructor that records your swing and analyzes it with you one on one afterwards .  
  I received this product ( See customer photos ) . It is not original like the photo ! . Do not waste your money ! . Very disappointed !  
  This company is very bad with rebate . Please send certified mail if you want to get your rebate . They are good at claiming not receiving your rebate . When you write to them , they don't response and don't bother to call them . Your call will be forwarded to their fulfillment center . I did file a complain against this company to BB and got a letter saying that the company did not response to their request . Last year , I bought this router with a rebate . Mailed in all the requested documentations ( receipt , original upc , form ) , but not by certified mail . Six months later , checked the status ( wheresmyrebate . com ) and said they need the original upc . Called them up and was told to resubmit a copy of the rebate . I did that , and 3 wks later , check the status again . Still said the same thing . Anyways , the whole process drags on and on . I called them up and was told the offer was closed . Anyone out there have this problem with Netgear rebate ? I don't know now . Maybe I should return it to Amazon for a credit .. Help .. Thanks  
  After shopping around for a few months I bought these speakers at Best Buy , for $ 99 + tax , to use with Adobe Premiere . At first I was unimpressed , then I went into my computer settings and adjusted the EQ , now they sound great ! I am very happy with these speakers but if I had one complaint it would be the lack of shielding on the RCA to 1/8 " cable , that goes from the right speaker to the computer . If you don't keep it away from other cables you may get some interference hum , however I 'm not sure any other system would have anything better . My wife and I love the sound of these speakers so much we are going to buy another pair to use with our family room tv . FYI - These are not a flat sounding speaker , would not recommend for editing / recording music , yet great for listening to already mastered music .  
  Wonderful lens . Received on time . Lens was as advertised . Lens is heavier than I thought it would be . Love it 's stabilization capability .  
  The Camera Bag turned out to be absolutely perfect for my needs . My Olympus D-550 camera fits perfectly into the pouch . The pouch has a padded removable velcro divider . My Kodak Max K2000 battery charger fits great on the other side ( at an angle because its width is larger than the pouch . On the other side is my camera with product manual . They fit just right such that they fit snug and cannot move around . In the front zippered pouch my memory cards fit perfectly into their special slots and the batteries fit in their respective elastic straps also . There was even room above the batteries for another 4 batteries in an additional small mesh pouch . In the zippered front pouch I was able to put some cables in loosly and the thing still closed nicely . The top of the bag velcros shut and then there is a buckle to snap in . This thing is built tough with a nice canvas like waterproof material . On the outside there is another mesh pouch on the side that my USB cable fit right into . On the back is a velcro strap that could be used to attach to a belt . I love the bag and would recommend it for all your small digital camera needs !  
  I bought two pairs of V-moda Vibe headphones so far , the first one split at the connector and broke , I wasn't able to get them replaced . The second pair spitted near the earbuds , got those replaced . They sound absolutely GREAT with wonderful bass but they just suck build wise . I 'm completely done with this company , will never buy from them again . Just ordered a new pair of Shures , hopefully those will last longer than the Vibes .  
  The 7 " LCD Portable display was not worth the money I spent to own it . First the battery would not hold enough charge to be considered portable . When the device was plugged in the picture would become distorted if you did not charge before hand . After one and a half months of having .. " not usage time " .. the sound would not work correctly nthen the picture started to fade out . Shortly after that the AC / DC ( wall plug in ) would not give the device enough power to even staqrt a movie . Unless you can personally verify the circuit level quality of this item your self , then do nto buy this .  
  This is a good sound card for those who wanna be a radio announcer or want to make voice-overs to sFX in radio dramas , but for gamers it 's just a lot of fluff . If you are into recording and singing I suggest going all the way and getting the Platnum ex , if you are into games , I suggest the Gamer version , it 's ( . . . ) cheaper and comes with Giants to boot . This card emulates 5.1 channels in most games but is not as good as Phillips in correctly emulating them . The only games I had a real problem with were Baldur 's Gate Series ( all of them including SoA & ToB ;) . These games cannot emulate speech through the center channel but instead emulate the music / fx in the center . This bothers me personally because BG is my favorite game . Phillips will play speech through center in ToB but not in the others . IceWind Dale works great with this Audigy card but Baldur 's Gate II SoA / ToB is terrible . The best games are Creative 's ' featured ' games , including Diablo , Deus Ex , and a handfull of others . BGII / ToB is on the EAX list but it doesn't work in 5.1 ( at least not appropriately ) ' Advanced ' HD EAX has yet to prove itself . When games come out ( next 6 mo ) This card will show what it can do ( hopefully ) . Not trying to disappoint but the Goldmine Demo was not that impressive to me . This Demo was supposed to show the cards full potential with EAX advanced . Birds chirping arounnd and wing flapping was pretty life like but the other things you can do were nothing shocking . I did notice a bunch of static when I tried to run some game demos in EAX that were supposed to be HD Advanced It is probably a driver issue that will be fixed when EAX 3 comes out . To conclude , do not buy this product just because it 's from Creative , that is not a good reason at all and they 're are better cards out there . Hercules is comming out with Maxi Theater X , a 6.1 sound card ( six speakers and a sub = 7 ! ) For right now there is Phillip 's Acustic Edge which has an excellent player and Power DVD .  
  I think these speakers are awesome . It 's really cheap , considering they are " Bose " ( look at other bose products . I bet this is the cheapest speakers they have . ) but they still sound like Bose . They 're really small , but they have pretty strong base , and sound is extremely clear . Many people criticize Bose since bose products are really overpriced , but I think this is a good purchase since it 's pretty cheap and has great sound .  
  the item 95101 I purchase for burning pictures on to the discs worked very well and would buy this item again  
  The ziga digital pic frame was easy to set up and works great . The only problem that I had was with the remote . The enter button on the remote does not work and did not work when I received it . Overall a good product .  
  Excellent piece of gear to gain more space on my desk . Fit and finish are great and it holds my 21 " monitor without a problem . My only caveat is the screen swivel ( to rotate the screen ) . If you don't torque the swivel securely the first time your monitor will flop sideways . Then , you 're going to have to remove the monitor from the mount to get at the nut . You might want to have help if your monitor is large and heavy . Other than that it 's a great product for the price .  
  I 've really enjoyed my palm pilot , it really has been so useful with my doctor appointments , etc . I 'm really happy I bought . G Minor  
  sure 4 Gb of the smallest form factor of just plain old storage is great . its good , fast no bells or whistles ( my style ) - but who is marketing genius said Easter colors , that what the market is demanding , purples and greens . That way they will match all my computer stuff ! But seriously , beyond the color ( which a quick hit of model paint fix ) , this works great . Could use a better cap , keep loosing it , but it is pretty useless anyway .  
  I read the manufacturers product description and it sounded just like what I was looking for . " It works with virtually any device with a USB port - even cross-platform from Macintosh to PC and vice versa . " When I received the drive , however , it wouldn't work with Mac OS 9 . I am running OS 10 but a lot of the files I wanted to back up were created with OS 9 . There was no information on the web site about supported versions . My OS 9 files were not recognised . I was understandable upset . I contacted Kingston for support and was give a tech solution that was not guarented to work and a disclamer : " If these steps do not work for you then unfortunately there is nothing else we can do for you . " So much for their " five-year warranty and Kingston 's legendary service and support . " The steps didn't work and I am not able to back up the files I need so I guess I am out of luck and Kingston is out a future customer . Lose . Lose .  
  Five stars for a good reason ! I got this at a great price and it 's just what I called for . The drive is fast and clearly built to last , I 'm confident it 's not going to fail on me , not only because of the excellent construction but also the warranty , which is ten years . The drive comes with a short extension cable and a dog tag with the corsair logo on it . Why ? I don't know , but freebies are always fun . The only issue I might have with the drive is it 's size , I knew it wasn't a small drive , it 's the price you pay for it 's near indestructible design . However any issues with closely situated USB ports can be solved with a little common sense , and also the extension cable helps . I carry this puppy around in my pocket all day and I know it 'll be with me for a while .  
  If you really must have a removable media MP3 player , this one isn't it . If I could rate 0 stars , I would . Biggest problems are it has no display , it won't find songs in folder , since it won't find songs in a folder , it 's limited to only a hundred or so selections ( there is a hard limit on the number of files at " root " level , which I discovered upon trying to load up a 2Gig card and could only get about a half megs worth of stuff loaded before the card crapped out . I ended up replacing this POS with a " JukeM @ n jWIN " for $ 15 and it 's A LOT better . The jWIN allows for your MP3 's to be in folders , so you can fully load the card with songs , on top of that it has a well lit display and good shuffle play , etc .  
  I bought this camera for my wife .. I 'm glad she lets me use it . I 'm not going to go into all the bells and whistles listed above .. I probably don't even know about all of them .. I 'll make it simple : It takes great pictures ! It 's not an SLR .. you 're not going to get 1080p HD from 600yds away on a dark night .. but give it a fighting chance and it 'll get you a good image . It 's very small and easy to carry and does it 's job admirably . I 'd buy it again in a minute !  
  Great lightweight headphones . Stay in place through all activities and they 're the only ones that don't make my ears hurt .  
  Doesn't work tried it on three different tv 's and got weerd lines with all resolutions tried interlaced and progressive scan .  
  My husband bought this for me last year primarily for the radio as I like to listen to local channels while I 'm having breakfast before I leave for work . The radio reception is great but the CD player stopped recognizing CD 's after only a few plays . What 's the sense of having an appliance that only partially works ? We just finished remodeling our kitchen and I told my husband not to reinstall this piece of junk on our new cabinets . What 's wrong with GE ? Can't they do anything right ? We 've had so much bad luck with GE appliances in the past ten years that now I 'm even apprehensive about getting on an airplane powered by GE engines !  
  Great keyboard and mouse . I 've had them for 3 years and they work like a charm . I use them everyday and I haven't had any issues . Batteries lasts about 5 months . Windows 7 automatically recognizes them so I don't have to be running extra software .  
  I have q-see 8 camera DVR and 1 of my camera 's was too far for the 60 feet cable included . I ordered this from amazon even with the so so reviews . The cable came , I checked it with my easy to get camera . The BNC extension worked just fine , but the power did not work . Sent back to amazon that day ( 1 hour after receiving ) , amazon sent me a new one the next day . Tested it on the short camera everything worked just fine . Ran the 100ft extension + 60 ft of original camera . All worked fine during the day . Problem comes at night . The camera requires more power at night for night vision . Sure enough this camera does not work at night . All the other cameras work just fine at night . Too the A / C adapter and plugged directly in camera ( everything in easy to get to attic ) and works fine . Plugged power directly into the 100ft cable ( minus the 60ft to the dvr ) and it did not work . Even with the a / c adapter in my attic , just for this camera , the 100ft is too long and does not carry enough power for the cameras at night . The 60ft cables work just fine , but if you need to get power down this 100ft cable for night vision forget it . Night vision is not really that important since it is only good for a short distance and the cable works during the day so I am using it because other cables are more expensive and who knows if the A / C adapter with the q-see system will go 160ft ? For me I needed to buy another A / C adapter , just for this camera . Plug in with extension cord to the camera in the attic . Then all works fine since BNC cable runs to the DVR . So 1 worked barely , the other didn't at all and I tested right out of the box .  
  Well what can i say , it 's a foam piece of goodness and very lightweight . I have a 14.1 inch laptop and it fits it perfectly and the foam grips it well . I was having overheating problems with my laptop and had 2 hard drive crashes before i finally realized it was due to overheating problems . Before i ordered this i had to prop my laptop up on a book or something to keep the bottom ventilated because it only has one fan . The product itself doesn't have any fans on it of course , but it does a great job of keeping laptops elevated to let air pass through . I also set my BIOS settings to run the cpu fan all the time when the AC adapter is plugged in and i run the SpeedFan app to keep track of my temperatures and all is well ! * I 'm giving hints and tips here people ! LoL * I don't recommend it for larger laptops because as said it is kind of small . I have a 14.1 inch screen and it doesn't even cover the whole bottom of my laptop . I only gave it 4 stars because IMO they should have included a couple of velcro strips to mount it to the bottom of the laptop , that would have been a plus ! But i 'm going to do that myself = - ) . Definately worth the [ .. ] bucks i paid for it though !  
  I just got it today . Well I must say I ` m very impressed by huge ammount of features , like Ipod dock , HDMI Port with 1080i upconversion , playable Divx movies and USB port . This is excelent entry level home theater for a great price comparing to other system avalible on the market today . A very intersting point is that this home theater has an option of firmware upgrade so it 's possible to update the software for this home theater when it does become avalible online , which is obviously great and gives an option of improvements and even adding some new features . Don't hesitate to buy If you 're looking for an excellent entry level home theater system .  
  The cables were exactly as described . Worked like a charm ! My son is a much happier kid now to have his PC working again .  
  This is a really good camera . I wont go into too many details , but it is extremely compact , when I got it in the mail I was truly surprised at how small it is , which is pretty cool . The pictures I have taken so far are good quality . I also really appreciate the rechargeable battery . To me that makes a lot more sense then having to buy hundreds of triple A 's over the lifetime of the camera . I highly recommend this camera , you get your money 's worth !  
  I just borrowed my friend 's Sony 101 to covert my analog footage to DVD and I thought that it worked great . After converting all my old analog home movies to DVD I thought I would take it out for a spin and see how well it records overall . It takes great pictures and allows you to save them directly to your DVD vs forcing you to download the images to your computer . I was also able to preview the video footage before I finalized the DVD . You also just hook the Camcorder up to the TV to view your films instead of downloading them to your computer . If you are more interested in watching your home movies vs editing them , then this could be a good camcorder for you .  
  Hi , this is my third bose sound system , the first being a lifestyle 8 system , a wave-radio and now this system . I bought this to replace my lifestyle 8 system , mostly on impulse for $ 1100 . I was also planning to upgrade my sorround sound for a while . As one of the previous reviewers , this is probably not the best value for money . Dont get me wrong , the sound is quite good , but I do not see a major improvement in the sound quality over my 6 yr old lifestyle 8 system . Overall , I am happy with my purchase . Just a note for one of the previous reviewers , the " boomy bass " can be decreased if you adjust it throuh the remote .. simply decrease the bass  
  Camera has good features and decent battery life for a " regular " camera . For those of you who don't need a special camera and just want something that can take decent pictures . This is a good one . I like it .  
  it works just fine with my i pod good sound good bass would buy again if in need of another pair  
  I was concerned that splitting the signal 4 ways would degrade the picture quality but this device worked perfectly and without any signal loss . I use this to split a DVD player onto 4 tvs in my shop and I 'm very happy with the results .  
  First , the bad : the surface scratches easily , so I would recommend that you buy a screen protector ( tip : instead of buying " custom " protector for $ 15-20 per one set , buy a generic set and cut it to match : $ 5 for three that produce about 6 sets ) . It comes standard with only a USB cable as a way to charge it . There are not as many accessories for it as there are for the iPod yet . That 's it , I do not have any other negative comments on the Zen M.Now , the good : a ton and I have owned it for more than three months . The screen is ten times better that any screen I have seen on an iPod or any other mp3 player ( I have owned two myself ) . After watching your first movie on it , you will swear that the resolution specs listed are wrong : the quality is unbelievable and watching a movie is a breeze , don't be fooled by the size . The file formats : one thing that Apple does not necessarily advertise is the fact that they use proprietary formats ; and the fact that you may need third party software to get YOUR OWN songs out of the iPod . The Zen M ? No problem , this thing plays almost anything you throw at it and you can move the files anywhere you want . Oh yeah , you can use it as a portable hard drive too and have all of your precious spreadsheets , presentations , documents , etc . on it . The sound quality is excellent , even though I would recommend upgrading the headphones if you are picky . I also tested it with my Bose noise cancelling home set and this thing surpassed all my expectations . The Zen M comes with several different desktop themes from which you can choose . Any picture that you store on the device can also be set up as the wallpaper . You can also create slideshows , rotate photos , zoom in , etc . The menus can be rearranged in almost any way you want and you can even remove items that you don't use from your main menu items . The battery life blew my mind . During one week , I used it every day at work ( not for the full 8-9 hours , mind you ) , watched a movie during two lunch breaks , and had juice left on Friday evening . In short , I love it .  
  Very good quality . And a great savings when you consider the price of genuine Epson ink .  
  I received this as my 40th birthday present from my wife and loved it right away . It was great until six months later when the screen went haywire . Lost the picture but had vertical lines up and down , stuck on . Palm sent me a refurbished unit that died within 2 months . Screen failed to come on . Palm sent me another refurbished unit ( that was pretty beat up ) but I cannot use the keyboard to enter text into a DateBook line item . The cursor jumps to top everytime . Others have had this problem as I 've read on a Palm Tungsten Forum . Palm is sending me another refurbished unit . This will be my 4th and I 'll sell this one and get another brand . Pretty disappointed with Palm .  
  I never thought of buying a power surge for more than $ 50 but I ended up bought two PureAV PF60 's . I know my power surge strip is suck and cheapy so I was looking for a better one to protect my gear and ran across the pureAV . After searching and comparing models between PureAV and Monster , I decided to go for the PureAV ( PF40 vs PF60 vs Monster 3500/3600 ) . I spent hours to go back and forth with / without the power console just to hope i can hear the different and I did . After that I just went to my computer and order the second one . Pros : - Price , around $ 250 new - 13 programmable , including the auxillary outlet . - Stage-6 filtering ( vs stage-3 from monster ) - big and heavy power cable . - Look nice and very cool on the rack . - Many other features , probably same as in HTS3500 . - High quality components , small gauge wires inside . - LIFETIME warranty . Cons : - QA / QC problem : both units have faulty outlet at bank 5 . The first one has to go back because the programmable switch is broken . The second I fixed it because of the loose terminal . - Can not set the " hight current " outlet to switch mode . I set the console to turn on / off the Amp trigger by the pre-amp but my speakers hum when it switch offr . I think it 's leaking current . - Black version is hard to find unless you want to pay more . As I said earlier , I bought the second one because I just hear the different soundstage of my stereo . I just wanted to test to make sure it works properly before put on my main AV rack but I just hear the different and my wife also confirmed that . It 's not just day and night but the music and the singer voice sound really pleasure , smooth and clear . Please don't quote me for this . I just want to share my story but it 's not my point because not many will believe it . I strongly recommend to spend a little more to get a decent surge protector , doesn't have to be a power console , just to protect your gear and rest assure that your systems , new LCD / plasma are well protected .  
  need amplifier or whatever other devices in order to have sound come outso tired of this kind of equipment . copy function is also badthis 100 $ product is even worse than a 20 $ product like sony TCM-150I am sorry I have to say this . However the seller 's service is the best , 5 star .  
  This is a very useful flash . I never use any of its custom functions or manual controls . I just use flash exposure compensation and / or ISO on the camera to control its output . I get great results . The flash just works with plenty of power to fill up a big room with light and it 's significantly smaller than the sigma ef500super and the 580ex . Also , I used to use rechargeable batteries , but too many of them , even name brand ones , would stop charging reliably . So I switched to using alkaline Duracells and they work equally as well as the rechargeables , give about the same amount of flashes and the flash recycles even Faster with alkalines than 2700mah rechargeables . Hard to believe , but that 's my observation . This a good flash for its size and price . One thing they left out is a way to trigger this flash optically with another flash .  
  I bought this because my laptop is pretty old and doesn't have a fancy built in webcam . Image quality is alright , though it could be better . It 's good as a quick cheap fix for your webcam needs . I run Windows Vista and usually use Skype , and this works well for me . I even used it for an interview I had over Webex , and heard no complaints ( I landed the job as well ) .  
  Yes , unlike other reviewers , I do own a 40gig iPod Photo ( as of 10/04 ) .. and yes I do also own a regular 3G 15gig iPod ( plus I 'm not pushing IP Address harvesting scams like the " free iPod " reviews ) .. so this was quite an expensive UPGRADE decision for me .. so this review is geared towards those struggling with an upgrade decision ( for those who own a smaller / lighter 10-20gig music iPod ) .. I own both PC and Mac formats . 1 ) BOTTOM LINE : Although \ very , very \ cool , I do not believe the trade-offs between the large size / weight and photo capability & extra battery life .. are worth the enormous price ( which includes a software purchase ) . Yes my 4 star rating is entirely based on how much incremental " stuff " you get versus what you have to fork over . But if money is not an object and you already own the larger / heavier 40gig variety , this becomes a " NO-BRAINER " upgrade - the ` wow ' factor is huge . If you travel quite a bit for business like I do , this is also a good addition to keep you company during trips . 2 ) PHOTO QUALITY : Good to " pretty good " .. but not excellent .. I do realize the size of the screen is only 2 inches , but photos tend to be slightly pixilated , even the full resolution ones that are over 2mb ( though you stop noticing after a minute ) and color reproduction is not all that great on skin tones and deep reds , but very good w / greens & blues .. ; which make pics of landscapes quite nice ! 3 ) PHOTOS ON MY TV : Now this is where this thing shines .. this is a really cool feature .. the iPod includes a mini plug to RCA out ( headphone to 3 pronged yellow / white / red ) that produces cool results when you plug it into your TV .. you can scroll through your photos on your big ( or at least bigger than your computer screen ) TV screen . However , having only 2800 + photos on my iPod ( that 's more than avg ) , I got tired of flipping through & showing off my albums in about 2 days .. 4 ) MUSIC : Besides not being able to see the screen as well w / out the backlight , it 's the same as any click-wheel , 4G iPod . 5 ) SIZE / WEIGHT : If you already own a 40gig variety , you won't have much to complain about .. but if you have a 10-20gig iPod , you will add more size and weight to your pocket ( or bag ) . Moving from a 3G 15gig , this difference \ to me \ is significant , as my iPod usually resides in my jacket pocket . 6 ) COSMETIC CHANGES : None on the outside , still scratches as easily as the rest , but has a color screen w / a new font and screen looks very dark w / out the backlight . 7 ) BATTERY LIFE : Conditional based on the user .. i never trust battery reviews on websites , as they vary DRASTICALLY when I employ my personal uses to the device . However , so far it seems to run near spec during mixed use .. and much longer than my 3G iPod . = SURPRISES OUT OF THE BOX = A ) NEED TO BUY SOFTWARE : In order to enable the cooler features - like syncing albums automatically , etc .. , you need to purchase or own iLife ( iPhoto specifically ) 4.03 or better ( if you are the rare few that bought your computer in the last few months w / 4.0 , you still have to download an upgrade to 4.03 ) .. Now I bought my iMac from the Apple website last Christmas and it still shipped w / iLife 2.0 .. so I had to purchase iLife 4.0 ( according to several company reps , there is no free upgrade from the jump from 2.0 to 4.0 ) .. which took me an additional day to figure out .. Yes , you can assign folders and such to sync to your photos to your iPod , BUT having an album editor enables full control of changes and what changes I 'm making , to the entire process . Oh Yeah , you need a high version of iTunes as well ; my pod came w / ver . 4.7 .. IMHO , you \need\ the iPhoto upgrade to enjoy this purchase . B ) TRANSITIONS : Only the " wipe " from right-to-left is included , maybe more will be avail in the future , but you are not given a choice . C ) SLIDESHOWS : You cannot assign multiple music lists in iTunes to specific albums in iPhoto .. as of 10/04 , you can only assign a SINGLE music list to ALL photo albums when you enable the slideshow feature . Yes , you can change this music list , but need to go back to the menu to do so . Also , you can only display-to-TV in slideshow mode ; you can't just flip through your albums in browse mode through your TV.D ) COLOR SCREEN : When not backlit , the screen during regular music playback turns \VERY\ dark , much more so than regular B & W ; iPods .. you need a light source reflecting off of the screen in order to see the letters .. typeface has changed too , more like " Arial " and slightly smaller . Oh yeah , with the backlight off , the screen still displays in color . TECHNICAL DETAILS : A ) You cannot adjust the color quality , size , cropping or transitions of the photos when detached from your computer , so don't bother asking a apple representative on the phone or at the store - they don't make enough money to actually buy one themselves . I 've tried two different stores the NY area . B ) Both the 40/60gig packages come w / an iPod dock ( if you don't have one already ) , but like the old ones , do not allow for use w / thick iPod skins and covers . C ) Comes with an iPod dock WITH a S-Video output ( new ) and a solo USB 2.0 cord ( finally ! ) . D ) Yes , this is thicker and heavier than your 10-15gig , traditional music iPod . E ) If you never upgrade your iTunes due to the hacks you can employ on earlier versions , then you cannot use the photo feature ( yes I tried ) . [ .. ]  
  I replace 2 X 512 GB memory in my Toshiba Satelite laptop with this 2 x 1 GB memory module . It was % 100 compatible and had no issue recognizing the memory . I have never had problem wit Crucial memory modules .  
  This KVM switch allows you to control two computers with one USB keyboard , one USB mouse , and one monitor . The cables are included , just plug it in . I have two and they work perfectly .  
  It 's true ! Works out of the box for Ubuntu .. and Windows XP . After spending waay too much time trying to make a couple of old webcams work on Ubuntu , I decided that it was time to move on . I picked up this webcam , and as the box advertises , it works straight out of the box on Linux . No hassles , no tears , no frustration . It just worked perfectly and made a perfect addition to Skype ! I just wish it had a microphone !  
  I have paid half as much & gotton double the copies with good quality . Why should I pay for their advertising .  
  The price was great . The picture took some time to get just right , but once I did , it was great . A CNET review discussed glare on the screen , but I have not seen this yet . Overall I am very happy .  
  I 'm not sure what speed / spec these cables are .. so I don't know if they would work for 3D . They work great for 1080i and I like how thin the cables are ; I got two them to route through a desk-mount monitor stand and the thinness made it easy to slide them through my cable management system .  
  I finally decided on the mini because of the size of the player and the fact that music could be stored in files . Three of my family members were going to use it , and we wanted to make sure we could all have our own seperate playlists . Downloading from CD 's was so easy , even I could do it quickly . I really like the " look " of the player as well . Very Cool . The things I noticed that were somewhat lacking is a guard or shield ( you have to remember to hit the " hold " button even when it 's off if you 're going to put it in your purse ) . You can buy one of course , for $ 30 extra . It also doesn't have an " off " button , but turns itself off if not in use . The earphones are ok .. the fuzzy things came off after about 3 days of use . My husband and son like a different kind , and ended up purchasing those instead . The sound is wonderful and the Monster car adapter ( $ 79 ) works great . I kind of wish it had a neck cord like the shuffle , I 'm not a big fan of the arm band ( which is also extra ) . We also have a one outlet hook up to our stereo and can play the mini straight through our speakers . Love the green color , btw .. very fun .  
  I used to like my Viking 512MB CF card a lot . I had such a card for more than a year . In that period , I used it in my camera . It 's filled up for several times . Also occationally I use a card reader ( SimpleTech ) to write / read that card , to transfer some big files between computers . It 's all fine , and suddenly one day , when the card was half full , and after a card reader reading , I got " CF card error " on my camera . Fortunately , after I delete a few pictures , I could move on . I gave the card to other people , so I don't know how it 's doing now . After that , I purchased another Viking 512MB , half year ago . I used it to transfer files for a few times , and have never filled it up using my camera yet . Now I am getting consistent " CF card error " message on my camera , even after re-format for several times , while I don't have that problem if I use another card . One theory I heard was that a card reader may damage a card . I can not verify though . Anyway , I will have to buy another card now , and it won't be viking for this time . = One month later = I contacted with their customer support . They gave me a number for return , and I mailed back my damaged CF card . They sent back a new one in a week . The new one is working fine so far . The exchange was not difficult . They did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt . They only verified the serial number . That 's good .  
  It works ! There is a myth that the more money you spend on an HDMI cable the better off you 'll be . NOT TRUE ! These are not complicated cables and I have never had an issue with any off brand cables I have purchased and I currently have about 20 cables in use in my home . No issues whatsoever .  
  Best headphones I 've ever used . Got these for the office to replace the Apple Earbuds I had been using . I couldn't believe the difference in comfort and sound quality .  
  Do not even waste your time with this . I don't even know how this product can be sold . I used it for about 3 days in my car to charge my ipod , and it ended up screwing up my ipod . DON'T BUY IT !  
  Nice price , Great sound . Only lacking an on / off button on the desktop speakers . Amazing bass .  
  I bought a XD to CF adapter , as per the picture on the page . Instead I received , as others did , a PMCIA adapter which is not what I wanted or needed . For the first time , I felt cheated by Amazon and don't know what to do . Hope to receive some explanation .  
  I have worn out one of these ! It took me probably 2.5 years to do so , and I use my computer a lot . It 's also used on a desk where I drop crumbs and the cat 's hair gets into the laser port . And the desk is wood .. anyhow , I 've had to clean the laser portal out a lot because of the stuck hair , which seems to love getting into there until the laser gets confused by it and won't work , but that 's been the only problem until yesterday , when it started intermittently losing contact with the computer . And thank goodness it started working intermittently to warn me " yo , gonna QUIT soon ! Get another ! " But that 's after a LONG time of use . And I use it a lot . click click click .. lots of scrolling .. lots of crud cleaned off of it . I love the light weight . I get sore wrists and don't want a heavy clunky mouse . I also like the clicky scroll reel , because I like positive feedback from my mouse ! I plug it into my Adesso keyboard , so I don't need a long cord . And I like the cool red laser light . So most of the things people dislike about it are actual features , for me . Don't think I ever loaded any drivers . Macs kind of come with them . I just plug stuff in and it works ( tm ) . I am so spoiled . :-)  
  I 've bought two of these for backups for two different Canon cameras . They 're much more affordable than the original Canon battery and perform as well or perhaps better . Excellent buy !  
  I wanted an ultra - cheap battery operated tv for blackouts during Florida 's delightful hurricane season ( if you are thinking of moving to Florida , forget it , unless the idea of living for weeks without electricity , not being able to afford home insurance , paying California prices for houses the size of bungalows , and dealing with loads of transient people with shady pasts appeals to your sense of adventure ) . It takes 8 C batteries and works just fine . It lasts about 16 hours on 8 batteries so stock up . It made the weeks without electricity more manageable . I also advise you to get lots of battery operated lanterns , headphones to block out the deafening sound of backyard generators , and a gun to protect yourself . Welcome to Florida !  
  All those people saying this is not a plextor 16x , why don't you open your eyes wider and look at the pictures of the Iomega on this site . It clearly shows that it has the fan and the exact same front and back faceplates . Compare it to the pictures of the Plextor unit . I own the unit so I know . If you don't own the unit , then don't disparage it !  
  i bought these , hoping to use them while working out . the sound quality was great , they were nice and lightweight , but within 2 lousy weeks one side went staticky and then stopped altogether . i do not recommend these for anything other than gentle use . wish i 'd read some of the other comments before i got them !  
  Its hard to find Cassette Stereo Players for cars anymore But this is a great buy for the price . The diplay is very easy to read even in light , with a built in clock . The sound quality is very good ( I had to change my old speakers too ) The tape doesnt come off automatically after you shut down the car but thats ok . I had it installed in my Honda Accord 1990 ( great model by the way ) whose original one starting making grinding noises . I dont recommend the cheap ones , the installation job was expensive ( professional ) and you dont want to do it again . Cructhfield service was excellent delivery and feedback  
  I bought this mp3 player because there was no way that I was going to fork over $ 200 + on an iPod with 1/10th the space . Also , I have a lot of music files in . ogg format , and I was ecstatic that this player supported them ! It 's also very easy to use - I didn't even need the manual to figure out how to set it up ! How it works : Plug & Play - it comes with driver software , but Win XP and newer versions of Mac ( OS X + ) will automatically install it and recognize it as a USB drive . From there it 's just drag & drop files from your computer to your player ! It supports . mp3 , . wma , . ogg , and . wav files , but not . mp4 ( iTunes ) , so you 'll need a file converter if you so wish . It has 20GB of space for songs and other files - I use it in place of a USB drive for some of my classes at school . It works perfectly ! Appearance : It 's super sleek , perfect size for a cell phone pocket if I want to take it on the go , easy menu navigation , and excellent play quality . Unlike the picture , it is EBONY BLACK with red undertone lights ( menu , arrows , play / pause ) . The screen is about 2 x 1.5 inches & full color - very awesome ! The whole player is about 4 x 3 inches , and 3/4 inch thick . Functionality : This player works super well . Excellent audio & very clear / thorough menu . I 've had it freeze on me a couple times , but it 's nothing that will damage it , and it 's fixed by turning it off and back on . I can't complain - but I don't use it as often as some people would . It 's probably too bulky to go running with , but it 's perfect for plugging into my computer speakers and just chilling out . It fits perfectly in the cellphone pocket of my purse for those long walks to class . It has a locking function to keep songs / volume from changing if you accidentally hit the touch-sensitive pad . All in all , I really love it ! Battery life : The battery life is a drawback - it gets a max of about 3-3.5 hours . But the A / C adapter charges it very quickly , so it 's good to go in less than 20 minutes . Video / Photos : The full color screen is like a tiny computer screen ! I haven't experimented with video yet , but photos of any size are fine . Video specs have to be within a certain screen resolution ( I think ) , and it doesn't support iTunes videos - just . avi videos . FM Radio : Almost CD quality sound . My favorite stations are local , so the playback quality is very good . I was surprised - usually FM tuners are quite poor in quality ! Other : The only thing I 'm having a problem with is figuring out how to make a playlist . There 's a default " favorites " playlist that holds up to 100 songs , but I don't know how to create another playlist . It 's probably in the manual and I just haven't read it , though . I 'm sure I 'm forgetting to mention something about this product , but I love my purchase , and I highly recommend this player to everyone who asks me about it !  
  I love this case . Since my life is now run by my PDA I wanted more protection for it than the little cover that came with it . I can already see the protection it 's provided by the marks on the case . And I don't worry about it accidently being turned on while in my purse and running down the battery . It also makes it easier to locate in my purse . I have no complaints with the latch . It has never come open in my purse . The case has been dropped sereval times on the floor , it has sprung open but the latch is still intact .  
  I waited for this case to come off back order and I am so glad that I did . I also have the body glove case which is great . This case is durable , zips all the way around , has more pocket space than the body glove , is waterproof , and has a removable carry handle . It isn't quite as padded as the body glove case but the carry handle should keep me from dropping it . I was tired of seeing everything I own in black and I love the red and blue Hawaiin print . Even though I 'm working , it reminds me of being on vacation . This is a fun yet practical case . A great price too . I may buy another one in a jungle print to brighten my black briefcase !  
  My daughter and her husband had been wanting a pressure cooker for some time after borrowing one from a friend . I had been pricing this same one on different web sites . They were always higher in price . And with free super saver shipping it was a no brainer . I received it within 2 days of ordering it . They love it and use it all time . It cooks so fast , they can cook a pot roast in less than a hour , meat comes out tender everytime . Thanks Amazon ! Another great purchase . Cindy from Gurnee  
  I bought this printer on the strength of its reviews . My goodness , Epson must have photos of the editor 's of PC magazines in compromising positions . Clogged nozzles , degrading print quality , hours debugging XP drivers . I 'm not a big review junkie , but registered with Amazon for the explicit purpose of warning you away from this printer . It 's too late for me .. but save yourselves ..  
  Totally dissapointed . I bought this item as a result of the previous reviews shown here , and what a dissapointment it really is . The image quality is absolutely terrible . The screen flickers , has a verry narrow field of view .. meaning , you have to be looking at it head on in order to see anything at all . I wouldn't purchase this item , and I don't recommend you do !  
  Exactly what i expected . Georgeous item , great for my nikon d200 and lenses  
  This bag is perfect for securely carrying a 17-inch HP laptop . There are pockets galore to hold computer accessories , other necessary files or papers , or office supplies . Strong straps , easy to clean , lightweight , comfortable to carry . I am VERY pleased with this bag .  
  I bought this product to one of my best friend . I bought it as a gift , he is really happy about it and he is recommending this product . He is very pleased about it .  
  I ordered this product as a Christmas present . My friend like it very much , said it is very nice .  
  I purchased the 50PF7320A / 37 50 " plasma tv from philips online store in Aug 2006 . Eight days after i received it the tv wouldn't power on and there was a flashing red LED on the front panel . I called philips to request a warranty repair . I was able to arrange repair with a local TV repair shop that services Philips warranty repairs . They came an picked it up . The problem was with one of the circuit boards in it . They were able to quickly indentify the problem and order a replacement part . The first part order took 2 weeks to even be delivered and then when the tv repair shop received it , it was DOA . The tv shop requested a replacement and then the part was on and is still to this day on back order with no ETA . The repair shop said it could possibly be months before the part was shipped in . So then i am furious i called philips to try to complain but they wouldn't even open a consumer complaint until the part was on back order for at least 1 month . So now i am having to wait over a month even after just having the tv for a week before i can even try to get my money back or a replacement tv . Then just as the 6 weeks had passed since it broke , the tv repair shop was able to use a part out of an existing working set just to get it back to me . Since i had been waiting so long . Now 3 days after receiving it back , the TV is acting up again , the same things it was doing , relays clicking on / off while set is off , before it stopped working altogether , are happening again . Found out that the part is still on back order . Appearently there is defective part that has not been fixed in these unit . Buyer beware , as if you purchase this set , it might work for a short time , and you will have it in the shop for more time then you can probably stand . Philips customer service is a joke , technical service is joke . This unit comes with a 1year warranty , and the additonal 2yr ext warranty costs over $ 700 . if you want to puchase this with a ext . just expect to pay the additional cost with the TV . In thinking back , if i would have know this was going to be such an ordeal . I would purchased a much better set from a better company and possilby even with a retail store such as best buy or someone who you can work directly with rather than going through philips directly . Just wanted to share my experience with this unit . One good note though . while its actually working , i am satisfied with the quality for the original sale price ( not including ext warranty ) . But if its going to break , then whats the point .  
  Received this unit and had it set up and operating in 20 minutes . Great picture with standard signal from Direct TV . Can't wait to see HDTV . This is the best name brand unit at 26 " that I could find for less than $ 900 . At $ 799 and free shipping it is the best deal around . As a prime customer , 1 day shipping cost a whopping $ 3 . Paid for itself in one transaction .  
  I like to be prepared for any connection possibilitiesSo , when I use 1 connector / adapter I always order a new one to keep in my stash of back-ups . This seems to be of decent quality . Exactly what I expected .  
  Mine stopped working about 2 months after the warranty ran out . A waste of my hard earned cash . Replaced it with a Samsung V3650 . Works flawlessly . Did i mention the toshiba was junk ?  
  This a fantastic equipment for those who love serius photography . I recomend this products 100 %  
  I purchased this a few months ago and wanted to wait till I used it several times before I wrote a review . Well , I love it ! I bought this because I saw Emeril Lagasse make several recipes in a pressure cooker on his show . Wow ! This cooker is amazing . I 've cooked several dishes in it , and every one of them has turned out delicious . I usually cook pot roast in a slow cooker for 6-8 hours depending on weight , but with this cooker you can do the same roast in only 45 minutes ! It comes out the same ; tender and juicy as if it was slow cooked for hours . I made chicken cacciatore in it last night , amazing ! It only took 10 minutes to cook ( about 2 to get desired pressure and then 8 min . with the knob rocking consistently ) . Wow again , it cooks food so much faster in less than half the time with the same results as if you were to cook for hours . My next dish is Emeril 's spicy ginger baby back ribs . He has lots of recipes for pressure cookers . Besides , this presser cooker comes with a recipe book and the recipes are fabulous . Also , since the cooker is stainless steel , nothing sticks and clean up is a breeze . It hasn't tarnished , nicked , changed color or fouled up on me whatsoever . It still looks brand new , even through all the uses . I definitely recommend this product !  
  Purchased from Amazon on Dec . 27 , 2009 . Headphones no longer working as of July 21 , 2010 . Tried all fixes but none worked , they are just dead . I know they are an inexpensive headphone but I expected them to last more than 7 months . Can't get them fixed as it would cost more than a new pair . I think I 'll try another brand . Any suggestions ?  
  My old Dell battery only held a charge for 20 minutes . This was a perfect replacement and now the laptop will run for over an hour . Exactly as described . Very satisfied .  
  great sound - exceeded my expectations - I 'm planning to buy a second one for my other TV ..  
  I bought this product based on several reviews when I was researching this . My main criteria was good sound quality and ease of installation . The installation was very straightforward going into our 2009 Toyota Corolla . The wire harnesses it comes with are designed for European cars ( mostly VW ) , so don't expect everything to just plug in . If you want to use the car speakers for sound ( and not get an external speaker ) , you 'll have to cut wires on the Parrot and the car radio harness in order to interrupt the speaker inputs going to radio . You 'll also need to find the radio mute wire if you want the sound system to mute when the phone rings ( for cars that don't have a mute input , you can use a relay to interrupt the accessory to the radio ) . The installation took about 3 hours , and the system worked flawlessly . When the phone rings or when I make a call ( either through phone or Parrot device ) , and car stereo sound mutes , and the call goes through the front car speakers and sounds crystal clear . I was so please that I bought another one for our other car , which I haven't installed yet . Laith Sinawi Web Development [ .. ]  
  This is a really great Palm for beginners or those who don't want something so high tech it takes days to figure everything out . I would have given this 5 stars but the only thing I didn't like about this was when you want to type you use your stylist on the abc area and you have to tap it quite a few times to get it to come on . Frustrating , but in all a great gadget .  
  Isolation is good , though minor strange noises may occur due to the deformation of the ear bud . The frequency characteristics seems to be not so good at first , yet becomes better after working several days . The space and position feelings are excellent .  
  I saw these phones on Amazon for $ 20 right before Christmas , so I decided to give them a try . After plugging them in to my Samsung MP3 player , I was somewhat disappointed in the overall tonal balance , which seemed to lean toward the bright side . But after adjusting the custom EQ setting on the player - adding some bass , I must say that these phones don't sound too bad ! Would I recommend these ? Sure . Especially if your player has an adjustable EQ so you can dial in the sound the way you like it .  
  This is an excellent card at a terrific price . It works great in my new Canon SD870is .  
  bought 2 set 's they work great ! had only 1 gig , changed to 4 gig computer flies now . Some of the best memory out there !  
  Works well for paintball . Cut holes to reach the buttons and to attached the lens . Good way to protect camera while shooting .  
  This worked very well for the first 2 weeks . Then for some reason it would only play music out of the left speakers . I verified that the Kensington was to blame after getting the same result in 3 other cars .  
  I have an iPod photo : consequently , one of the functions one sometimes wishes to use is the screen in order to display such . I bought this product for the screen protector , as many other ones only protected the iPod 's shell . The lousy , loose , cheap piece of plastic has actually managed to GRIND dirt against the screen ( because it 's designed to move around ) to leave some v . nasty scratches . That said , iPod is extremely well protected , but that 's not what 's important to me . I will now have to spend $ 20 buying scratch-polishing fluid to fix the damage this product caused .  
  I recently purchased a Samsung HDTVSamsung LN46A550 46-inch 1080p LCD HDTVwhich I also occasionally use as a computer monitor . This keyboard works great when I 'm sitting on the couch , 15 feet or so away from the computer , and using the TV as my main monitor . When I 'm back at my desk using the desktop monitor , I use the standard keyboard that 's hardwired to the computer . This keyboard costs a little more than most the other wireless keyboards I looked at . However , it got good customer ratings for it 's performance from a distance , and has the mouse pad built in . Those two qualities are what finally sold me on it . For anyone interested , I use an AB switch boxManual Switchbox Db15f for Vga Monitors 2x1 Abto switch to / from the TV monitor and my desktop monitor . In my case , I already have two monitors connected to the video card on the computer . The AB switch allows me to easily alternate between one of those and the TV . Other items you might need if you want to do something similar : 2Tripp Lite P502-006 SVGA Monitor Gold Cable w RGB Coax HD15M / M - 6ftperhaps a longer cable depending on how far your TV is from the computer . Make sure the cables are male on both ends as all the monitor inputs for the above ab box , tv and computer are female . 1Cables To Go - 27412 - 12ft 3.5mm Stereo Audio Cable M / M PC-99 ( Beige ) for connecting your PC line out ( sound ) to the TV . Edit 5/24/2008 : After writing all this about using two monitors via one connection on the PC .. my son pointed out that a vga splitter would be simpler and allow the tv and pc monitor to display the same image simultaneously . Cables To Go - 29550 - 2-Port UXGA Video Splitter Extenderseems like it should do the trick , eliminating the AB switch from the equation . The cable that connects this particular splitter to the PC looks like it needs to be a non-standard M / F though ( looking at the picture ) .  
  Reading reviews on this monster earphones they have very good reviews . Unfortunately my opinions are totally opposite . Sound quality is great but volume is very low . Bass none what so ever which is very disappointing consdering $ 40 earphones have more bass and volume which is also nice and clearI have also ordered a pair of Klipsch IMAGE S4 , going by those reviews im hoping there much better than the turbines .  
  This accessory is great ! It make an otherwise somewhat small camera much easier to handle . I ordered the battery grip along with the XTi kit and put the battery grip on right off the bat . The options of using 1 or 2 battery packs or AA batteries is very nice . A second shutter release button and main dial makes holding the camera vertically much more natural . The convenience and improved handling is worth the otherwise high price . I will never use the camera without it ; especially with the 430 Speedlite and 28-135mm IS USM lens attached - just too much weight for the native grip of the camera .  
  Bought 2 of these because they were so cheap , but neither worked . Not worth returning them . Guess it 's true , you get what you pay for !  
  Within the first month I noticed that the router was intermittently dropping both wired and wireless connections . During these connection drops the router could not be accessed at all . " Ping " commands to the router 's IP address were timing out . This indicates a failure either with the firmware or hardware . I submitted an online support request to Netgear , waited a week , and received no response . I submitted another support request , and again was ignored . The third time , I sent a message saying their support was useless , and they deleted my online registration . I can forgive problems with a product , but with such a lack of respect for customers , I think Netgear is a company to avoid .  
  I travel very frequently and spend a lot of time in the airports and planes working . I was always uncomfortable working on confidential or personal stuff as people close by would always look at my screen . This privacy filter works great . It requires the viewers to be in a very narrow range to view the screen clearly . I strongly recommend this product . The price point is very nice and is an absolute value for money .  
  I have been using a mouse almost daily for the past 15 years or so , and I can honestly say that this is the best mouse I 've ever used . I 've been using a cheap Logitech one for the past few years , and I have had a couple small gripes about it that this mouse doesn't suffer from . i ) This mouse is pinpoint accurate . The cursor doesn't drift like it might with cheap mice . ii ) It also has very smooth tracking , so that the cursor never jumps around . Not having smooth tracking was a very annoying impediment with my last mouse which would bother me especially when I played first-person shooters . Although I have only been using this mouse for a day now , I am very impressed . A friend of mine owns one as well , and has been using it for about 5 years without a single issue . I can definitely recommend this product to anyone .  
  It 's thin and sturdy , but the lens-facing threads are not perfectly round . It takes some care to thread onto ( or off of ) the lens . Nevertheless , it 's quite a bit easier than attaching / detaching a filter directly to the lens .  
  I purchased this filter for the sole reason of protecting an expensive lens . I can wipe dust and fingerprints off of it easily without worrying about scratching my lens . I use lens paper to clean the lens , and have never had issues with scratching .  
  I 've had this mouse for 4-5 years , and I have always loved it .. but lately my mouse has stopped working , so it was time to find a new mouse .. after spending several months looking I bought some other logitech cordless ( and optical ) mouse .. After having had this mouse for 1.5 months I 'm looking for a replacement for that one , so I 've started searching again . the reason I didn't buy this mouse in the first place , was because I live in Denmark , where it 's impossible to buy this mouse .. Amazon . co . uk don't have this mouse either :(  
  I rated this 5 stars based on its utility for my laptop . The device itself is quite compact , appears to be sturdily built , and is easy to use . I have Windows XP and after plugging it into a usb port it was recognized immediately and ready to play . The sound quality is mainly midrange - unlike another reviewer I did not hear deep base , and nor is the treble very extended . But the sound is clear , it plays at sufficient loudness , and it sounds WAY better than a normal laptop speaker . This isn't audiophile-grade hi-fi sound , but it is very decent sound in a nicely built , attractive and easily transportable package . It also comes with software to adjust the sound but I haven't installed this ; it sounds fine without it . Definitely a big improvement over built-in laptop speakers .  
  It 's nice to be able to listen to an iPod ( or any other audio source , for that matter ) in my car without having to endure breaking cassette tape converters or fuzzy FM transmitters . This connects straight to the CD changer dock in the trunk of the car ( Sable ' 98 and a few other ford models - check your compatibility ) . Because it uses red / white RCA inputs , you 'll probably have to hit Radio Shack or some other electronics store for a RCA to 3.5mm cable in order to use a MP3 player , but trust me , it 's worth the trip .  
  I have had the Coolpix 5700 since July 2002 , and I am delighted with the photos I have taken and the compliments I have received on them . I have taken some stunning photos and printed them onto 8 x 10 photo paper with incredible results . I 've even blown up tiny portions of pictures without any pixels becoming visible when printed ! The Coolpix has a number of features that make it a great camera , but it also has some drawbacks . The 5700 has several different user modes that can be preprogrammed for different situations . The auto modes are well-programmed if you don't want to set these items manually . The auto-focus has several different settings ( i.e. spot , matrix ) and a manual override that comes in handy for photographing minute items such as spider webs that are too thin for the autofocus to " see . " The 8X optical zoom is great for setting up shots without having to move . The biggest drawback I have found with the 5700 is that it is useless for digiscoping . I have a Swarovski spotting scope through which I want to take pictures ( bird watching , etc . ) , but because of the size of the lens on the 5700 , my pictures have severe vignetting . If you want a great camera for digiscoping , I recommend the 4500 . Another disappointment is that the 5700 does not have the panorama assist feature that the 4500 has . Overall , the picture quality and settings for the 5700 are great , but it has a couple of drawbacks depending on what you want to do with the camera .  
  I bought a pair of these for myself and later another pair for my wife . These headphones are of excellent quality and sound great . The noise canceling feature is perfect for listening to music on long plane trips . Although a little big , they are quite comfortable and I think the over-the-ear design cuts out more noise than other headphones . I highly recommend these for anyone looking for some peace and quiet .  
  I was looking for an inexpensive fax / copier since I already have several printers . The price on this all in one fax / copier / printer / scanner caught my eye . The favorable reviews that others left made me buy the Canon MP530 . I have used the copy , scan and fax functions and all work great .  
  I bought this to use with my Nikon 50mm f / 1.8 and screw on rubber lens hood . It is a perfect match there is know movement within the case . I would highly recommend this for this combination ..  
  These headphones are not very good . Very cheaply made-one ear doesn't work unless you wiggle the cord around . The sound is okay I guess and the volume knobs on the actual headphones are nice for recording music in our home studio but the quality of these headphones is VERY low ..  
  I was worried the battery would only last a short time but it 's been a month and it 's still going strong .  
  I bought these headphones to replace two sets of the same make and model . They fit my 5 and 6 year old very well , they are easy to adjust the volume . The two sets I was replacing have made it through two vehicles and they finally had been stepped on and broken but they still worked if you put them on  
  I bought my headphones over 15 years ago . At the time , I purchased them based solely on the fact that they were the most comfortable pair on the rack . Flash forward 15 years and they 're still the most comfortable pair of headphones I 've ever worn . I 'm no audiophile , so I can't comment in-depth on the sound reproduction . Suffice to say they 've always sounded awesome to me . So after 15 years of moderate-to-heavy use , I can say the following : - They are as comfortable as they day I bought them ( the most comfortable I 've ever worn ) . - They sound as good as the day I bought them ( the best-sounding I 've ever tried ) . - The cord and connections are as solid as the day I bought them . Yes , they were relatively pricey , however , I think they 've more than made up for that in longevity . Not to mention awesomeness . A couple very minor complaints : - The cord is very long . Usually this is an advantage , but it can be a little bit of a hassle sometimes . - The material covering the padding on the ear cups is definitely showing its age . It 's flaking quite badly and the inside edge has come unfastened , exposing the foam rubber .  
  I have owned this machine for only two weeks , and consumer DVD recorders have a distressing tendency to fall apart after a month or so , so what I say must be taken with a grain of salt . So far , so good . This machine offers excellent image quality and is notably more tolerant of different brands of discs than some other recorders I 've owned . Far fewer " disc error " or " can't read disc " messages than my Philips or my Go-Video . Although this machine bridges the format gap by recording on DVD + RW ( not + R ) discs as well as DVD-R / RW discs , it does not afford the full functionality of a DVD + RW recorder . Most notably , one cannot do " thumbnail " picture icons for chapters , and I was also unable to add them using a + RW recorder to a disc first recorded on this machine ( perhaps this could be done with a computer ) . Also , the editing capabilities of this machine , which are formidable , do not apply in + RW mode . So this is not truly a " dual " machine . Another minor note : the " one-touch " dubbing function , which operates via the firewire connection , does not work unless the tape being dubbed was digital to begin with . Thus it does not work if you 're using a Digital 8 camcorder outputting a digitized signal from an older analog tape . But these images can be recorded in the " normal " way just fine . All in all , I 'm very pleased , so far . Hint : check out the " used and new " merchants before you pay amazon 's price .  
  I highly recommend this product , the C3180 . I made Christmas cards on it this year , scanned and printed lots of silly stuff , and scanned and printed lots of important stuff . I 've had it for 3 + months , now , with no hassles . I bought extra ink cartridges for back-up when doing those cards , but didn't need them . I had replaced the cartridges maybe a few weeks before . And the software that came with it is so straight forward and easy to use . As for the price , Staples ( or was it Office Max ) had it for , I think , $ 84 before tax . But I wouldn't have known to buy it without Amazon 's feedback . Oh , and it arrived like two days after I ordered it ! 5 stars .  
  Use Canon ink with you Canon printer and you 'll have no problems , just excellent pictures .  
  I 've never had so much trouble with DVD-R media as with these . I 've used about a third of my spindle , and at least half of them had to be thrown away because of media errors . I thought TDK made bad discs , but these really take the cake . Never , ever buying these again . Save yourself a lot of hassle and frustration and avoid these discs .  
  Works as advertised on my 60Cx , I was wondering after reading a review that it didn't , it does . Using on a motorcycle so I wouldn't go for the USB power because it seems like it will create a weatherproof seal whereas the USB won't . It 's a must have for me . 4 stars because of the price , yes it 's steep .  
  This comfortable and slightly portable headphones carry a fantastic sound that makes me find new details in the music that I 've never heard before . You could say that it does not block surrounding noise well and there is noticeable sound leakage , but I see them as sacrifices in order to grant the best sound possible for an under-$100 set .  
  I was very excited about this product after reading all the online hype . Sadly this docking station is not quite as it seems . As a good example of planning not meeting execution , the idea and design are great , but the construction and quality are not . Here are some of my observations : Pros : - Great idea to pipe video to a widescreen TV-even a better idea to see song lists and titles on the large screen . Navigation via the included remote / on screen menus is as easy as operating an iPod . - Great overall ` look ' of the docking station , cool looking black and shiny remote with rubber backing . This setup was obviously designed with black iPods and Nanos in mind and matches them well . - Separate RCA jacks for L and R audio ( versus headphone audio jacks ) make the unit appear like a genuine stereo component . - S-Video support for video-out . Cons : - Price is steep - ` Just OK ' sound quality that is tonally in the middle of the spectrum ( i.e. no pronounced bass or highs ) . Even with premium cables ( not the cheap ones supplied in the box ) , a high-end receiver will highlight the mediocre sound quality . - Poor overall ` feel ' of the docking station . It is light , thinly built , hollow , and feels as ` plasticky ' as any sub-$20 , low-end Chinese-made piece of electronics . It 's light . The weight of my Monster audio / S-video cables pull the unit back towards my cabinet . Only my 60GB iPod itself makes a good ballast to counter the weight of the cables . - Remote control buttons are not sensitive and require multiple presses at times to work . Again , this is typical of cheap Chinese electronics . - Poor manufacturing quality and control-there are odd , thin cut marks along the remote control 's hole punch-outs . It is obvious these marks are machine made . - On screen display layout / fonts are far from sexy . They remind me of the graphic quality of a 1980 's , 16-color Apple II computer . ( Is this some sort of Apple retro statement by DLO ? ) - The unit gets very hot to the touch when charging an iPod . Obviously the bad quality control and construction extends to its internal circuit boards . This was very disconcerting to me as I feared damaging my prized iPod , and is the main reason why I returned the item . Bottom line : The box cover says it best when displaying the song , " Never Satisfied " on its mock TV print layout . Sadly , most owners will not be satisfied until DLO gets it quality control issues worked out . Now where do I find a good iPod stereo dock ?  
  I routinely buy Sony sound product for their crispness , these are no exception . They stay on while running into the wind and sound great .  
  This memory card is one of the best cards ive bought for my psp . The card holds up lots of music , photos , and movies . This is worth like say about 20-30 dollars at the game store . But instead buy it here on amazon for about 15 $ . I recommend you buy this memory card .  
  I took this out of the box and within minutes ( no exaggeration ) had a picture scanned , saved and posted on my web site-very easy to use-no power cord , the USB does it all . GREAT PRODUCT !  
  Hello . I recieved the product on time . Was in good condition . Work great . Good price . Thank you .  
  I was not sure if I would like this camera when first purchasing , but after receiving and using it , I have only one compliant . The camera does not show or have a battery usage indicator in the display . Other than that it works fine . Takes nice pictures and the wide angle lens comes in handy when shooting those group pictures and getting everyone in the frame . For those who are thinking of buying a digital camera , this camera with 7.1MP is more than enough to enlarge pictures to 8x10 size , and will meet most of your everyday shooting needs , and it less expensive than some of the larger MP types on the market today .  
  Excellent sound quality . My grandson loved the first Grado 60 so much I gave it to him and bought a second .  
  i got it at $ 130.00 on dec , 2008 . i thing this is a good price , and ship is on time for me to go to las vegas  
  I purchased this tv on Jan . 22 , 2008 and had no problems at all until about Mar . 11 , 2008 . Just a few weeks over the time limit to send it back to Amazon and get a replacement . Then the high pitched sound started . Once the tv was on for an hour or two it would develope a high pitched whine coming from the back of the set and continued the whole time the set was on . I contacted Samsung and they had me send it to NJ for repairs . Well , I got the set back from NJ today ( after almost 3 weeks ) and it doesn't even look like the same set . When I sent it in for repair I sent it in the original box with all original packing and it arrived today in a different box with different packing . My brand new tv ( barely 3 months old ) that left here without a mark or scratch on it , was covered in scratches , back and front . Further unpacking revealed a 1 " diameter hole in the front left corner that was broken out of the set along with pieces of plasitc that just fell out of the packing . I was also completely missing the oval base plate that I originaly sent . I contacted Samsung again and they said to return it once again to the repair shop in NJ to see what they had to say about it ? So much for Samsung 's warranty and customer service , it 's beginning to look like I 'm out almost $ 700.00 for a beat up , broken , missing parts tv . It 's really a shame too because before the noise started up and I had to send it in for repairs it was a nice tv and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it . All I can say is " Good Luck " if you purchase this set and I hope that you don't encounter the noise and have to send it to NJ for repairs .  
  From what I have listened to in the computer audio market , there are two kinds of speakers . Those that focus on power with a sacrifice in fidelity ( gaming type systems ) and those that focus on fidelity while losing power ( music type systems ) . These are a shining example of the latter . They have a wonderfully transparent sound to them , very articulate and airy . These are the most detailed computer speakers I have ever heard . They are better than the vaunted Klipsh Promedia Ultra 's IMO . This set also has one of the punchiest subs on the PC market . Of course , it doesn't hold a candle to a true home stereo sub , it is still sharper and tighter than even the Klipsch subs . However , it is not capable of the klipsch 's output . The system itself is very elegant and has a wonderful piano finish that is very upscale looking . Bottom line , for $ 150 street value , these are a steal . If you are an audiophile who values clarity , balance and nuance over output , it is very hard to do better than these .  
  resonable price about $ 40not so fast to record and read data but indurable !  
  Vienen 100 hojas , limpias los negativos los guardas alli , los pones en un folder y se mantendran en perfectas condiciones , buen producto  
  Great quality cord . Thick coating to make it last through the years , good solid heads , all the pins are strait , and the signal is good too . Great purchase  
  I would have liked to have been able compare the quality of this set to others , but was unable to find them locally . Instead I used the reviews here and elsewhere to come to a purchasing decision . Considering that , I 'm very pleased with these headphones . I bought them primarily for watching TV when walking and running on the treadmill . ( Treadmill is on the porch - neighbor didn't want to listen to my TV ! ) Reception is clear and range is as advertised with little drop out even while outdoors and using the living room TV . My only complaint would be that while very comfortable on my head , they slip forward when I lean over . Some of the other reviewers have noted the same thing . All in all , except for that one flaw , I think they are perfect for my purposes .  
  I always loved Sony TV until I have this one . It 's a big disappointment . At first the TV was working just fine , then it start to turn off by itseft . Sometimes , it turn off itself right after I just turn on . Then one day it just won't turn on at all . I thought the lamp was bad , so I replace the lamp but that didn't fix the problems . Called Sony and was told this is out of warranty because I have the TV a little bit over 2 years . They gave me a couple numbers to call for repair . They found out the circuit board of the TV is bad and the total call to fix this TV is $ 730 . Plus they also told me the light engine will be next to be broken too . SONY TV SUCKS ! I 'll never buy SONY TV again !  
  This cool looking alarm does exactly what I want an alarm to do . I can go to sleep listening to a CD or radio and wake to CD , radio or alarm . I haven't tried the MP3 connection yet but that offers me another option . I live in a " fringe " FM signal area and the included wire antenna brings a reception as good as any other I 've tried . Sound quality is better then most FM / AM radio alarms I 've used . I like the option of falling asleep using one sound source and waken by another source . Two different alarm settings is a very useful feature . Three levels of lighting are available , the brightest will light up a room ! The back light alone is more light then I want . It would be nice if that could be lowered or turned off . After much searching , this alarm is the best I have investigated , with the most useful features .  
  Nice and small , worked great . Dont expect to fit a projector and a 15 " laptop on it though . I would say most projectors and any 12 " laptop would work .  
  Great shots . Great size . Especially great shots in low light . Does everything promised .  
  I originally considered the InFocus X1 , since it is highly rated and probably ' the ' most recommended projector in this price range . However , I am sensitive to the ' rainbow ' effect ' that DLP projectors are prone to , so I had to turn to LCD . The NEC VT46 has some favorable reviews out there , and it has a shorter throw than the X1 , so I decided to pick one up . Wow ! The picture is much better than I expected ! Despite being a 4:3 projector , it produces an amazing picture with widescreen DVDs . The colors look very natural and the contrast is excellent . The short throw lens and manual zoom allow me to create a huge image from the coffee table , and it 's also very quiet so it doesn't intrude on quiet scenes . I don't hesitate to recommend this projector ; It has exceeded my expectations .  
  I bought this tv 2 weeks ago and I dont regret it . There are plenty of jacks for anybody who has a lot of components to plug into their tvs . Picture is georgeous . I am using my xbox360 on it i am blown away every time i turn it on . As mentioned in previous reviews this and every other plasma tv is prone to " burn in . " Turn the contrast down on the tv for the first 100-200 hours of use to help prevent it and dont leave static images on the screen for more than 2 hours . Use the built in screen burn protection features as they get rid of every burn in issue i have had with the tv so far . I recommend this tv to anyone looking into HDTV as this is my second HDTV . Never going to back to standard tv .  
  I have a Mac , and need a USB mouse . I wasn't paying attention when I purchased this , and was surprised to discover that it had a PS / 2 input . I shouldn't have been surprised , given that it 's clearly marked in the description - my mistake . I 'm writing this review in hopes of preventing others from making the same mistake . Otherwise , it seems to be a great mouse . If you have USB , you likely want this one instead : $U$ Logitech B100 Optical USB Mouse ]  
  The connection to the Palm Tungsten T is so loose as others mention that the charge light goes on and off by itself . Its hard to believe that a reputable company can say that this works for this model . I wish i had read these comments before i purchased it . The bulky original cradle is such a piece of [ junk ] that im thinking of switching to a Microsoft PDA due to the better designs from the companies making them - don't laugh , i switched from Nikon to Canon Digital Camera 's due to Canon 's much better charger which needs no wires . The travel charger doesnt seem to be a solution - Palm , get your act together before you lose ALL your customers !  
  I 've been spending time seriously researching which LCD HDTV I 'm going to buy . My choices are between the Sony 26S2000 , Panasonic 26LX600 , Samsung LN-S2641D , Sharp 26SH20U and Toshiba 26HL66 . I 'm a Sony fan , owned several of their TVs over the years and been pretty happy . I was leaning that way again - my last TV was a wonderful 23 " Sony LCD HDTV that I gave to a close friend because she didn't have a TV and I wanted a slightly larger model with HDMI anyway . I know most people now pass over the 26 " and go for the 32 " but the smaller size suits my small living room which I don't want to make a screening room ! However the recent Consumer Reports ( that I personally respect a lot in the absence of any other thorough independent comparative study I can get my hands on ) on the new crop of LCD HDTVs put my Sony preference on hold because the Toshiba is TOP RATED in both the 26 " and 32 " categories . I spent some time looking at these models over the weekend and my decision is almost made . The Toshiba picture looks great - better than the Sony ( though it 's hard to tell in a TV store where everything is on an HD feed ) . So with Consumer Reports ratings and analysis placing the Toshiba ahead by 3 points overall , actual design and price comes more into play - and I have to hand it to the Toshiba ! The Sony looks pretty dull and a bit too plastic ( I know they all are made of the stuff ! ) whereas the Toshiba ironically looks pretty cool because it seems to have taken it 's styling cues from Sony 's highly desirable XBR line ! BTWI didn't include the XBR in my quest because it 's much more than I can afford - though of course I lust after it . But for some $ 300 less , the Toshiba may well prove to be an excellent top rated XBR substitute . In fact it 's the least expensive of all the other models I mentioned in this review .  
  After receiving this device sometime in late 2004 , I put it to use as an ebook reader . The battery lasts several books when the screen is turned all the way down , and it can hold several novels in memory at the same time - but who needs the Library of Congress on one device ? Switching files around between it and the computer is dead simple and as efficient as can be , as it connects via a serial port . The color display is nice , and the IR port allows the IIC to be used as a universal remote . ( Much to the chagrin of my teachers ) Here it is now , 2010 , a full decade after the Palm IIc was released - and the docking cradle for my IIc still sits in the same spot on my desk it was placed , six years ago . The same for my IIc holds true . It has served me faithfully , and probably traveled upwards of ten thousand miles at my side . Ten years later , and this brick of plastic and silicon still functions . Six years down the line , and I 'm still devouring the written word with this remarkable device . Although Amazon itself offers an ebook reader , I find myself strangely attached to this fantastic little gizmo . Sure the screen is a wee bit on the small side , it uses a serial cable , and it 's a decade old , but it works . Were mine to break , even now , I would buy another as a replacement . Why spend so much on modern ebook readers when my faithful IIc serves my needs . So here 's my review , ten years late : Buy it . It won't let you down . And tomorrow , I have a function to attend , and a long ride to get there . If you 'll excuse me , I have to load some reading materials on my IIc .  
  I managed to purchase these on sale for approx $ 87 AUD to replace a set of beats by dre studios I lost . In terms of music quality these are really something special within other IEMs of its price range . The bass is most definitely its strongest aspect where you literally feel the thump upon your ear drum with certain songs ( Doesnt sound too appetizing although it really is awesome ) . The mids and highs are a little muffled due to the overwhelming bass at times although this can easily be fixed by changing the eq on your player . I was contemplating the purchase of a fiio E6 amp to accompany these ( for bass purposes ) although it really isnt necessary unless you 're an extreme bass head . Their biggest downfall is comfort . After about 20 mins of listening it really does take a toll on your ears . In order to accomplish their full potential you really need to stick these in deep ( well i do , anyways ) . Considering the size of these it begins to hurt after a while to the point where i need to remove them to give my ears a breather . Hopefully after a while my ears become accustomed to them so I can enjoy their awesome quality all the time : DNote : An extensive period of time should be allowed to burn them in before you begin using them . So far its been 20 hours and they are already sounding better .  
  I have found the sound to be quite pleasant . This would be great as a replacement on an older sound system and also with a new system as well . I think it would work in a 2.1 sound system for lets say a small room / bedroom . The freq . response is very good for the size and price .  
  This adapter seemed like it was going to be a good investment . But what they do not say on the description , is that its only compatible to a computer running windows xp or lower . There is no driver for any system running anything higher than that . Anything higher than that it can not recognize . Also , it is only a USB 1.0 connection . You might as well go for the next version of this adapter , although i do not know if it would be compatible though with a usual windows 7 operating system .  
  I use it with a 1.4X teleconverter and it still give me a very good image quality  
  I set this up and was initially very impressed - easy to use , good sound quality for the size and price of the unit . Within a couple of hours , however , something shorted out - the display started blinking with no LCD characters . Unplugged , plugged it in several times , changed batteries , etc . but no effect . I was going to exchange it for another , but these reviews have changed my mind and I am getting a full refund instead . The lack of radio presets is a surprising inconvenience but the way the wake-up volume works ( automatically going to MAX ) is an absolute show-stopper . This product has potential , but not without some design changes and better quality control .  
  Solid performance for everyday use going on a couple of years now . I buy original because often buying the cheaper stuff comes back to burn you .  
  I ordered the this item and what I received was a different cheaper model . I will never order from Fog Dog again and am considering the same for AMAZON . I contacted FOG Dog and have returned the scanner . I was told I would recieive a full purchase refund plus the cost of the retunn shipping . Within an hour I received an email indicating there would be no refund for the return shipping cost . I am still wainting for the refund for the purchase price of the SC230 scanner I ordered but was not delivered . BEWARE ! Uniden SC230 Scanner featuring Pre-Programmed NASCAR / Busch Frequencies  
  I just got a Dell Pocket DJ for Christmas and I got a car kit to go with it . Well the transmitter that came with the kit was the Belkin one . Well that thing is a piece of crap . It worked once and than it didn't . Plus I didn't like the automatic on / off . It took like 20 minutes for the damn thing to turn on . So I went to Radio Shack and talked to the sales person . He showed me the Monster FM Transmitter and I was like " Ok , I 'll give it a try " My car is a 2004 so it doesn't have a tape player , so I have to use a FM Transmitter . Anyway , I love this thing . It is practically crystal clear and I only had to change the station once during a 45 minute ride which doesn't bother me because I realize these things aren't meant to be perfect . I just wanted to be able to hear my music and I can with good sound quality and it is easy to use . I would definetly reccomend it .  
  This is a bad headphone radio for people who listen while exercising . The earpiece hurts and digs into ears and head in about 2 minutes . There is no foam around the earpiece either , just hard plastic . You need that foam to absorb sweat when you exercise . Get the SRF-HM33 instead .  
  I purchased four sticks for my older HP Pavilion . ( I know it only recognizes 3.3M but for the $ I got the extra stick ) . The installation was easy and my machine runs noticeably better . I couldn't beat the price . The local shops wanted 40-60 dollars a stick . I got them for 20 . I would recommend and do business again with this vendor .  
  I 've had this router for a little over a year , and in that time I 've had to call for support at least 5 times and go online to try to fix it myself at least twice . This thing has a mind of its own-for weeks at a time everything will be fine , but then one day it decides not to acknowledge the password I entered for it . It 's caused me no end of aggravation , and I 've sworn that the next time this piece of junk misfunctions , I 'm tossing it and getting a different router . I 'll never buy another Netgear product .  
  Perfect fit , nicely done . About the only thing they could do better is enlarge the hole for the headphones , but I did that with a hole puncher for paper and it works fine .  
  Have not had that much time to enjoy this little camera , but when I have used it is fabulous , the picture quality is devine and the technology in that little case is incredible ! I have experienced the outside sunshine problem that has been noted in previous reviews , but a b / ball cap for a visor and it worked great . I think we will have years of enjoyment from the memories captured on this fine device . It is Olympus quality in a little credit card size box ! Am thinking a ViewFinder would have made the price a definite bargain .. but as they say .. we can't have it all , so enjoy what we have !  
  You can spend less and get less at the local hardware storeThe build quality is outstandingThe unit looks , feels and functions beautifullyExcellent specs and credentialsI bought three and am ordering several more , the feeling of security on my expensive electronics is extremely satisfying  
  I bought this laptop off-the-shelf when my old laptop 's hinges broke . I 'm an IT guy - I have used lots of laptops , by lots of manufacturers , and this is hands-down the worst I 've encountered . Contrary to what some reviewers have said , Sony 's were not the most expensive laptops ; in fact , I talked myself into buying this one based largely on the price . That was a mistake , for the reasons that follow . Pros : - Was available off the shelf with reasonable specs - Uses mostly decent hardware - Integrated webcam - Quick setup out of the box - Reasonably impressive specs ( but comes with Vista , which undoes much of that value ) Cons : - Keyboard is flaky ( one of my keys died after a year , others have problems and are dying , and nearly half of them have popped off randomly at least once ) - Mouse pad is flaky ( often stops responding for a couple minutes ) - WiFi card crashes a lot ( will refuse to turn on ; will turn on but not find any networks when I am right next to a router ; will find networks with good signals and not connect ; will connect but not send anything ) - Hard drive is non-standard ( can't replace it with non-Sony drives ) - Hard drive is often very slow - Battery life is terrible ( less than 1.5 hours at full power , less than 2 on power saver mode ) - whoever said it got 4 hours was either lucky , wrong , or using an upgraded battery - CD / DVD drive is * loud * - Integrated speakers are terrible - Integrated microphone is terrible , even by laptop standards - Laptop gets * EXTREMELY * hot , even in standby . I actually worry about it starting a fire ( this does happen ; a friend 's laptop ignited her coffee table in the middle of the night ; no defects were ever identified ) . - Screen latch is badly placed and frequently flips up while I 'm using the computer - Screen hinges seem weak and flaky ; they feel weaker every day , and I fully expect one or both to break in the near future . - Screen design makes it impossible to hold the laptop in one arm when it 's closed ; no matter how you grip it or how lightly you hold it , you feel like you 're crushing or at least badly bending the screen ( because you are ) . - Screen suffers random areas of burn-out where the backlight fails or becomes permanently and abnormally bright ( this happened almost immediately when I got it , for no apparent reasons ) . - Ergonomics ? Awful . The wrist area is extremely uncomfortable . - Windows Vista is wretched . Sure , it 's pretty , but it has major speed and stability issues ; performance is often lower than XP , which is why many manufacturers are continuing to offer XP , even though Microsoft is trying to phase it out . Simple tasks like moving and copying files take forever . The hardware demands are also tremendous . - Too much pre-installed random software . Cleaning it up is a real chore . - Shortcut keys ( mute , volume up and down ) randomly start and stop working - the mute key will often light up when pressed , but fail to mute the speakers , for example . Sometimes , they reverse their functions , and do the opposite of what they 're supposed to do . - Screen brightness is too narrow a range . I often can't get it bright enough in certain settings , but can't turn it down enough when working in dim light . Given the chance to do it over again , I would happily pay a few hundred dollars more for a different manufacturer , even if it meant giving up a little on the specs . This laptop is simply not worth the money , and after only 13 months of ownership I 'm already contemplating replacing it in the near future .  
  Though the wire worked well , when I had a question and needed to contact Q-See I found that Q-See had little if not 0 costumer service . If you buy from them your on your own . Don ` t expect any help of any kind from the company . They seem to have no respect for their costumers . Contacting them is just about impossible and when you do get to talk to someone they are of no help at all . Use another company .  
  I held on to my Canon film SLR as long as I could while the digital camera era passed me by , but the cost for the Rebel XTi became reasonable enough for me to splurge into digital without sacrificing my existing Canon EOS lenses . The only existing Canon equipment I swapped was my Speedlight 420EZ which wasn't compatible with EOS digital for a 430EX . I have used Canon products for over 20 years . Canon Rules !  
  I searched in local stores for a privacy filter that would fit my LCD monitor at work . This search was unsuccessful so , I almost gave up on the idea of having my monitor filtered away from people leaning over my desk . I went to Amazon and found this 3M Privacy Filter PF17.0 for my 17in LCD Monitor . This was the best purchase for my office since there are no ground wires attached . Now everyone in the office is wanting a filter .  
  I have to only give this 2 stars . The product description says that this product is 2x1.2x48 when in fact it is 1x . 5x48 . This is a significant issue . If I didn't need to do this project in 2 days I would probably send it back for the right product . I think I can force the cables I need in here and have it stay shut , if it does workout then I may raise my star rating to 3 but the whole " false advertisement " in the dimensions has really set me back . Outside of that the product itself looks good  
  I love the new Shuffle from Apple . I already owned a Photo iPod and purchased a Video iPod , but I got this one because I needed something to workout with and the other two were too big and bulky . Also , I was afraid the damage that could happen if I had dropped one of the other two iPods .  
  This is the 6th time I bought this product . bought 4 for my family , and bought 2 for my relative . such a great speaker system for the price .  
  I 've owned this printer for 8 years ( bought it new , but not on Amazon ) and it is still going strong . My use is not that heavy , but I definitely use it at least weekly , and it has served me well for printing out wedding invitations , PDFs , black and white photos and maps , tax forms , coloring pages for my kids , envelopes , you name it . Amazingly , I am still on the original toner and drum that came with the unit . I have never experienced a problem or failure with this printer . Before I had this printer I had an Epson inkjet photo printer which worked good at first , but kept jamming , etc , and I realized with the ink costs , it was cheaper just to get my photos printed at a certain nationwide chain store . And , I hardly ever printed anything in color . One thing that I should mention is that the factory installed memory is a bit limited . It 's definitely fine for printing documents and most everyday printing , but in order to print full page full-resolution pictures and such , you 'll need to upgrade the memory ( I have mine maxed out ) , otherwise the printer will convert the picture to a lower resolution . I doubt that I use my extra memory often , but it 's nice knowing I am able to print a full 1200x600 page if I feel like it . I realize this printer is now considered obsolete , and so my review is probably wasted , but for what it 's worth , Brother has gained a very satisfied customer and if / when this thing finally dies , you can be certain I 'll be buying another one of their quality products .  
  I bought the EX1011 for a xmas present and I have to agree with the review by Dennis Wierzbicki . I was very disappointed to find out you cannot transfer photos from you PC to the frame wirelessly . Kodak wants to control this though the use of their online Gallery which to me is only to sell you other Kodak junk . Some other problems ; I have a network drive and when I try to copy pictures to the Gallery you cannot browse the network . You have to have the photos local or on a lettered drive ( ie C : or D :) . So you have to first copy the photos from your network to somewhere you can upload them to the Gallery . I put photos up in the Gallery and some were in portrait mode and it could not switch them unlike when they are on a memory card , you had to do rotate them manually and then re-upload them to the Gallery . It also allows you to use you PC to host the photos instead of the gallery but you have to use Media Player 11 but who wants to leave their computer on and tied up with Player to show pictures on a Frame ? And the comment about having a default album at startup is correct . It is a very confusing interface . Also it tries to load a lot of crap on you system when you install the software  
  This digital voice recorder was a bust - and Sony should be whipped for marketing it . The sound quality was semi-clear on a voice test , but in action it failed big time - even when subject to be recorded was 2 feet away ! Don't even think about it - some things you can buy because you trust the brand , but this one I 'm out the $ 79 and change . yuk  
  Bought this tv mainly because of it 's style . Grew tired of all the Black tv 's and the fact my living room color scheme is Carribean Flavored . I did however do all my homework and stuck with Samsung due to my last tv being of the DLP flavor ( which was wiped out by Hurricane Katrina ) . At first I really wasn't blown away and thought my previous tv looked a lot better when watching DVD 's . However , since then I 've hooked up my Playstation 3 and watched my first Blu-Ray Movies and WHOA ! Need I say more ..  
  Be carefull . Amazon sent me a PC10016X64SODIMM , currently a generic module from Viking instead of the announced C01063 module type . What Amazon is selling does NOT work on compaq Presario 1200 series notebooks !  
  I bought both the fraction calculator and the see n solve . The brightness of the display screen was normal on fraction calculator and dim on the see n solve . The fraction calculator dose not display adding or subtracting in the same format as the see n solve . If the display was brighter this would be 5 stars .  
  Better than described , works very well does have a tendency to fall forward but more my fault than the bag , Loved the leather  
  This is a good product . Would definitely recommend others to buy it .  
  I purchased this as well as two other sizes . They work great for keeping all my family portrait pictures in one place .  
  I bought this cable to connect my Playstation 3 to an HDTV set that has only DVI ( I think it 's DVI-I ) but no HDMI . This cable works beautifully . Image quality is really good . The price just can't be beat . You should be aware that while HDMI carries both audio and video , DVI is video only , so you still need to route the audio to your TV somehow . For example , I use an optical digital audio cable to do that ( together with an expensive converter box as my old HDTV set doesn't have an optical input ) .  
  i just got mine last week so i 'll just try to list some pros and consPros - the screen is more crisp and clear , just wonderful compared to the iPod video ( this is proof now that the images in the early reviews that the pics for Creative ARE NOT saturated to make them look better ) - sound quality is also better , this coming from Creative so for sure - the earbuds were the most surprising thing , they sound fantastic . I never realised how bad the ipod earbuds were until today ( i am a former 3rd G ipod owner ) when i walked into an Apple store and did a comparison in the store , then switched it with the Creative ones . The ipod ones don't isolate the sound as well and it lacks bass , as if it isn't there unless you use the EQ , whereas the Creative ones have a nice bass and a fresh clear sound . Even on the same volume the creative ones are considerably louder - 4 hours of video so you can actually watch a whole movie and still have some battery left over to listen to music - 15 hours of audio life , Creative website says 14hrs but on reviews by Cnet on test , it was actually 15 hours . - though bulkier than the ipod video , the size makes it easier to hold , IMO the size is perfect , it 's exactly the same as my 3rd Generation iPod with a silicon case - FM radio , great addition if you wanna just listen to the radio sometimes , i doCons - Internal battery so you can't personally remove it - the verticle scroll is a little too sensitive , being a former ipod user , it takes a bit of getting use to - buttons are a bit stiff at first , but i notice as time goes by it 's easier to press - no " on the go playlist " like the ipod , if there is i haven't found out how to do it yeti give this product a 9/10 , however because of some very biased reviews giving 0 or 1 , i am bumping this up for a 5/5  
  For the price of this unit , I was a bit skeptical that it would do a good job . Recently , I bought an $ 80 unit at C. City and returned it within two days because : 1 ) even with a good " static " station , the quality of the music coming through was average at best , and I had to keep finding new stations to make it happy , even driving in the same town 2 ) I had to completely " disrobe " my ipod from its skin to play it in that model ( it was the kind that you have to clip it directly into a fastener which remains down by the cigarette lighter . ) Disrobing the skin from my ipod was inconvenient for me because I also use it regularly in the gym and need its skin to keep it protected , as well as clipped to my pants . Knowing these things , I knew I wanted to find a model that would accomodate the ipod skin as well as do a good job of playing on my car stereo . I was not disappointed with this Kensington . This design fits great w / the ipod skin , just like the regular USB cable you use to attach it to your computer . Also , the sound quality far exceeds the pricier model I had purchased earlier . I found one radio station and never had to change it - - the sound quality was fantastic - it was very similar to the same quality you get when you listen to a CD.I also was much happier with this model because it is much easier to see in the car - - the models that clip down by the cigarette lighter make it impossible to change the music while driving ( which of course , I only recommend doing at a red light or while stopped . :) Overall , I was very pleasantly surprised and delighted to find just what I had been looking for - - all at a very reasonable price !  
  There are really 2 different headphones here : before and after burn-in . You DO need to play this baby for at least 2-3 days non-stop before they open up . The HD-280 are high-quality phones and very revealing , without being aggressive or clinical . Tape hiss on older recordings is enhanced but the sound remains truthful and musical acrosse the spectrum , with no exagerated frequencies , annoying overtones , or distortions . Classical / jazz listeners will be particularly pleased by what they hear . These cans are exceptional value and can be driven by just about everything . Headphones technology must have advanced quite a bit in the last 10 years . Whatever the case , I believe Sennheiser has a winner here . Now repeat with me : I WILL BURN THEM IN .. I WILL BURN THEM IN .. I WILL BURN THEM IN .. I WILL BURN THEM IN ..  
  Installs easy and is very easy to use . It prints crisp , clear documents and pictures . The seperate ink units are a plus . The only downfall is the noisy paper advance .  
  i would defiantly recommend buying a zen over an ipod . a zen has everything an ipod has plus more and its cheaper .  
  This little machine does a great job for very little cost . We have tried call notes and other machines but with the features it offers there is none better . The call announce allows us to screen calls without getting up .  
  I purchased the Sony speakers to use in a home office . They offer excellent sound at a reasonable price . Good quality for the money .  
  Its very light though note its size cause its definitely not the micro-sized superspy type monocular ! Only drawback is that since the non-eyepiece opening is only a ' medium-size ' not the larger size some monoculars have , this unit ' darkens ' the view slightly . So its not a great choice for use in real low-light conditions .  
  My Mac Mini has a mono built-in speaker , which left me in need of a stereo set of speakers . After weighing my options and reading a few reviews , I knew I didn't want to spend a lot of money for casual background music while working on the computer ( I have a dedicated home stereo system and when I want to do my critical listening that is where I go ) . If you are looking for a 2.1 package to be used for casual background music while working on your computer , I must say , these speakers are a far cry from being disappointing ! They turned out to be much better value than I expected for the $ 29 plus tax I paid for them . Keep your eyes open for mail-in rebates . Honestly , after listening at length , if I had paid full price I would still be happy ! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED ! I may buy a second set as an add on for the bedroom television .  
  I got this thing for Christmas , I wasn't expecting it , so eventhough I was planning on buying the Linksys version eventually , this was a nice suprise . The only thing I had a little problem with is setting it up . The included software treats you like you are stupid and tries to force you to do their automatic setup software crap that DOESNT WORK.I finally went to DLINK 's website and figured out the IP address to log into the router and manually set it up myself . The instructions on Dlink 's website were clear and concise , and after reading it I was able to manually set up the router myself . I like the freedom of being able to use my BellSouth fastaccess service on work laptop anywhere in my home without having to be in the computer room . Before this router if I wanted to use my laptop in my bedroom I would have to resort to using this POS Verizon Broadband access PC5470 PC card that absolutely sucks , slower than dialup and even more unreliable . Not anymore though , now I can use my reliable home ISP on my laptop anywhere I choose to go in my homeMy other computers are still connected to the dlink router with wires as I don't plan to move them around the house . If you don't use the automatic setup crap , then you will find that its pretty simple to set up . Don't forget your encryption key !

  This flashlight is small and light to carry and give a strong light for inside , I use it for outside to check out my ranch at night it works great for its size , I can see at 50 meter , 100 would be better for me but I just walk a little more and it does it . I used it 2 weeks already 15 min . every day without charging and it is still good .

I started developing pains in my mousing hand from my old unergonic dell mouse so i decided it was time to upgrade . This is by far one of the most comfortable mice i have used . I decided to get the corded version because i didn't want to be changing batteries all the time . nice job logitech !  
  i opened the box and there were more wires and cables than i knew what to do with ! the directions were very very poor and i had a difficult time knowing how to set it up . i did finally figure it out . the transmitter has to be plugged in ( fine ) . the speakers have to be plugged in ( okay .. ) and to get both speakers to play they have to be connected by speaker wire ( not okay ) . didn't meet my needs to be able to move one to one room and one to another room . the sound was great but not a wireless product by my definition . returned them .  
  Their compact size , appearance and superior , and clear sound quality all for a reasonable price make them a great choice  
  i bought a laptop from advantage and it is not what i expected . the external drive is broke and its beat up . i was told by eugene if i remove the bad feedback he would have it replaced . i assumed by the way he was emailing me that i was to get the replacement the same day i give the broken one to ups . i called this morning to get the tracking number and i got the rudest man ever on the phone . all i wanted was the tracking number and he accused me that i was going to put a rock in the box and return it and that i was NOT going to get a replacement immediately like i assumed by what eugene had made it sound . this has me very upset and i will not be doing business with advantage computers in the future . jeanne wrann  
  The bag had very high ratings , so I purchased it . No doubt , it is a solid , well put together bag . I do not expect anything less from Wenger . I was a bit disappointed by the overly buly top part of the bag , but the other facets of the bag are so great I decided to keep the bag .  
  I was really looking forward to using this item when I ordered it . What arrived was not a VP2130b , but rather an N2201w LCD TV with built in DVD player ( with a selling price of about $ 400 ) . When I contacted Amazon , they offered to let me keep the ' item with slight damage ' ( their description , not mine ) and offered me a refund of $ 122 ( lowering my cost at that point to $ 477 ) . I declined as graciously as I could and canceled the order .  
  noise on the receiver , touch lamp goes off and on when on phone , phone rings when talking on other phone  
  I moved to this point and shoot camera from a Kodak and WOW ! It is one great little camera . I take it in my handbag everywhere that I go . Need a quick shot of something , no problem . The picture quality is great as well . The pictures are not grainy and are very clear . I have used it extensively since I got it in August and I am more than pleased . I take lots and lots of photos so it has been put to the test . My daughter liked it so much that she even asked for one as well to replace her 2 year old Kodak . Buy it ! It 's great !  
  The receiver handles all kinds of music with clarity and power . I live about 50 miles from most FM stations I listen to , and the receiver is sensitive enough to bring most of them in with just the wire antenna . The remote did not work when delivered . I contacted Harman Kardon and the customer rep sent another one to me . It works , but the keys are small and the colors of the keys , labels , and basic unit make using it harder than I would like .  
  Had this awitch for about two weeks .. Beats the heack out of my pld LinkSys . Have 2- NAS 's Two HDMI Micro Computers on HDTV 's two printers a Lap Top and two Wireless Access Points . All work great together . By the time I wrote this I subsiquently purchased a D-Link 24 port Rack Mountable Switch to replace / add to this one .  
  I have been drooling over the idea of getting a GPS for awhile . I just moved to LA from Ohio .. HUGE DIFFERENCE when it comes to driving .. My car has been littered with Mapquest directions ever since I got here .. Well I did my research , and the TOMTOM GO has been praised almost EVERYWHERE . The packaging reminded me of the ipod , and it even comes with a case ! It comes with a suction cup mount ( which is what I use .. does and good job ) , but also a adapter so you can stick it more permanently on your dash . I have been driving a week now , and I can say it does a great job . Sometimes it doesn't always take my preferred way , but thats to be expected . Its 3d view is super cool , and it will make any passengers jealous and in awe . It also has a option to hook up to tomtom 's website and update it , I downloaded the " valley girl " voice on to my unit , so now my audio directions are " Up ahead , like , turn to the right or something .. " hehee .. funny . A recent update made the brightness higher , so the glare problem isn't as bad .. but it still could use a glareless screen ( I think you can buy protective screens for it , for Pocketpc 's , etc ) TomTom GO is not only a nice small sexy fun portable unit , it does a great job too .  
  We have been using these binoculars for some time now and it works great . We had a similar pair like this but misplaced it on a trip to Hawaii so I 'm sure someone is enjoying it too . We like it for it 's small size and wonderful optics . Easy to adjust too .  
  It 's hard to find a high-end DVD / CD player with 5 disc capability . Most today are only single disc . The SACD audio is awesome , but make sure you use the individual channel outputs for SACD as the optical out does not work on SACD for my tuner . Picture clarity is great and near HD quality . If you want a single unit to run high-end DVD and audio , buy this unit . The only complaint I have is that there is not a shuffle button on the unit , you have to use the remote .  
  My PC connects to my wifi ( n ) network automatically every time I wake up or start my computer and the connection is solid . I can stream 1080p movies over the air from my other PC no problem . I recommend this .  
  Glad I ordered this one ! After reading the reviews , I was not certain about re-purchasing . We decided to rely on our own history of owing the same model for 11 years , which we were very happy with . We have had it for 2 months now without any problems . It arrived in perfect condition . Improvements to the buttons are great ! We made the decision to go with the larger oven again because the size is there if you need it . We haven't used the sensor because we know the settings we want . The heating is even and gentle enough on the lower settings to warm refrigerated bread dough perfectly . There are enough settings to get exactly what you want . An excellent value ! Thank you Panasonic and Amazon !  
  The picture you get from this monitor is better than the Dell monitor , photos just look sharper and the color is better . It only has one DVI input . Be very careful when you purchase a DVI cable for this monitor ( the one it comes with is about three feet long ! ) you must get the DVI-I or something like that . If you get the other DVI cable it will not fit . Overall it is a good monitor and gives excellent quality right out of the box .  
  I honestly don't know how I lived without my iPod ! I debated between the Nano and this one because I had heard that the video wasn't supposed to be very clear and I couldn't imagine that I would want more than 2 GB of songs . I am so glad that I picked this one ! Unless it 's in really bright light , the video is very crisp and I love watching T.V. shows that I missed while I am taking the train to work . In addition to loading all of my CD 's onto it , I have downloaded videos , songs and podcasts . Although it 's still only about 1/3 full , I obviously would have filled the nano right away . There are only three things that I don't like : 1 ) Even though I keep it in a case , the screen somehow became scratched ; 2 ) The headphones are a little too big for my ears and the foam covers fall off easily ; and3 ) Apple should provide the cord to allow you to charge it using a wall outlet . Other than these minor issues , it is a fabulous product and I am very happy I took the leap !  
  I got this little puppy for my Macintosh after researching various USB Smartmedia readers from brand name digital camera makers ( that go for $ 60-70 ) for my Olympus D-360 camera . This was half-price ! It 's simple to use and a fast way to get your pics into your computer . The card just comes up as a disk on your desktop and from there you can open the pictures right from the card itself or copy them to your drive in a jiffy !  
  While the HP PhotoSmart C618 [ and its twin , the Pentax EI-200 ] are older cameras , they still have a lot of capabilities left to explore , with the addition of the Tiffen HP618AD adapter . Installation is as simple as it can be - place the adapter over the lens and camera body , and tighten the mounting screw on the bottom . [ See my product photos . ] The mounting screw uses the camera 's tripod socket for attachment , but the adapter replaces it with a new socket directly below the lens [ on-axis , where it should have been in the first place ] . Once installed , the adapter allows the use of a wide variety of 37mm filters and lenses , and since it seems that 37mm is a popular size for small camcorders , there is absolutely no shortage of generally inexpensive add-ons which can be used to augment the camera 's built-in features . Since the threads are standardized , any circular 37mm photo / video accessory probably will fit this adapter . [ I haven't found anything yet which doesn't fit . ] Some of the most interesting and useful possibilities come with the addition of aftermarket lenses . For example , while the camera has a minimum macro focus distance of about 10cm / 4 " , the addition of a + 10 macro diopter will decrease this distance by a factor of 10 , allowing much closer macro shots from about 1cm / 0.4 " away . Add a second + 10 diopter , and the focal distance is decreased by a factor of 20 ! Some extremely close-range macro shots can be achieved through the use of this adapter and an add-on lens or two , photos which would be impossible otherwise . There are also various wide-angle and telephoto lenses available , enabling one to capture a wider area than the camera could capture on its own , or to zoom in much closer than the camera 's 3x optical zoom would allow . If I have any complaint about this adapter , it is that it can interfere with composition and , in some cases , flash lighting . Circular vignetting - the appearance of a photo having been shot through a hole or tunnel - tends to occur in varying degrees with almost any accessory , and the more you mount , the worse it gets . The camera 's optical zoom can be used to reduce or eliminate vignetting effects , though sometimes not entirely , and this is when photo cropping becomes necessary . I would assume that one could use stepping rings to mount some larger filters - 46mm size , for instance - and that should take care of the vignetting problem . On the other hand , mounting an accessory with a diameter significantly larger than 37mm will also cause that accessory to partially block the camera 's viewfinder , and can also block the camera 's flash somewhat , causing a quarter-circle flash shadow in the bottom right area of the photo . In short , it is usually best to use this adapter in situations where the camera 's flash will not be required , or , at the very least , with only one or two relatively thin filters if you also wish to use the camera 's flash . All of this , however , is due more to the design of the C618 / EI-200 than to the design of the HP618AD adapter . When the adapter is installed and secondary lenses or multiple filters are being used , you ARE shooting through a tunnel , so a certain amount of vignetting is often unavoidable . [ Note that there is no vignetting if you do not have any accessories mounted to the adapter . ] Also , the camera lens , viewfinder , and flash are all relatively close together , so there is going to be some interference when certain accessories are added to the front of the lens - these cameras just were not originally designed to be used like this . Even with these issues , though , the HP618AD is still an invaluable additiion to any C618 / EI-200 owner 's kit , enabling one to expand creativity , add effects , get close , get wide , and generally do a lot of things that the camera can't do on its own . These cameras are not SLRs , but they are still capable of doing some rather spectacular things that one might not expect from what amounts to a point-and-shoot camera with a few manual controls . All you need is the Tiffen HP618AD .  
  Well , It worked " OK " for about a year . All of the sudden it stopped working after the warranty was completed . Did not work well with virus software installed and never create CD-ROMs at the max speed . Overheated and crash the computer several times before it completely died . Buy something else !  
  My daughter 's car has a relatively small glove box , but there were certain items she wanted to keep in there . This organizer was just what she wanted . Big enough to get her required documents into , plus a small flashlight , pen , pencil , notepad , map ; yet small enough to fit in the small opening referred to as a glove box . Works great for her needs . Case Logic AGB-11 Glove Box Organizer ( Nylon , Black )  
  I purchased this item along with my Garmin iQue M5 I recently purchased and let me tell you , it was the biggest waste of $ 15 I 've ever spent in my life . Upon opening the item , I noticed a cloth along with the instructions , " wipe screen before application " . So .. I followed the directions and then applied , or tried to anyway , the screen protector . The item wasn't very adhesive at all and when I finally did get it to stick , i noticed a piece of dust became lodged under it , and had to remove it . When i attempted to re-apply , it wouldn't adhere at all . I found this humerous as it clearly states in the packaging , " Washable and reusable " . Anyway , I ordered another one figuring it was some sort of defect , but the same exact thing happened again . It was the biggest $ 30 mistake I 've ever made . If you want screen protection , I recommend the ones made for the PSP . You 'll have to trim it a little bit , but they work much better .  
  did not fit the camera i had in mind , always double check the models listed with the model you 're intending it for use ! seems like a fine battery physically ..  
  This keyboard feels very much like a regular fullsize keyboard . I found it easier to use than the smaller versions . The keys have a great feel to them , and your hand rests comfortably in position . There are even places to put your stylus . I love this thing !  
  After using her old Presto for 25 + years , part of the pressure release mechanism broke . Thanks God ! She had found a couple of Prestos on line , and asked me to order one for her . I asked if she had checked Amazon and she admitted that she hadn't . I told her to wait a minute and let me do a little checking . At Amazon I found the same pressure cooker for about $ 10 less , and it included Free Shipping . I ordered it on a Sunday and it was delivere by Wednesday . She really liked the looks of it , and when she tried it for the first time , she found out that she didn't need to cook things as long as with her " antique " Presto . She showed it to her mother and five minutes later I was ordering another one for her . It 's a pleasure to have TWO happy females around , especially when I get the credit ! Thanks Amazon for keeping your prices competitive , and that Free Shipping is GREAT ! - Ken Fisher  
  I got a couple of these L2410NM monitors , and have been very pleased with them . To make it clear , there IS an HDMI input . There is NOT a DVI . There is also a VGA input , component / progressive scan input , standard RCA input and S-Video input . I 've used all the input connections , and only the HDMI input will continue to give you a blue screen if the PC is put to sleep ( which is a shame ) . I mostly use the monitor for doing large network Visio drawings and graphics work , and recently I dedicated one to become a media station connected to a spare PC running Windows Media Center . It works great for this purpose , but I had to fall back on the VGA input because it was too annoying to put the PC to sleep and still have the monitor turned on . I really couldn't tell the difference anyway in quality since I have the resolution turned down to 1280 x 768 in order to make web surfing visible from across the room . The menus are classic Westinghouse with buttons you have to " feel for " along the right hand side . I really wish they would replace the buttons and make them easy to find and easily labelled . The menu system really isn't bad .. it 's having to work the menus by " feel " that sucks . I 've used it a lot for video games , TV , DVD 's , and graphics work on the PC and I 'm really pleased with what I got for the price . The only actual " bug " is the blue screen when you use the HDMI signal when the PC is turned off . Tom  
  I bought this product a while ago , and after several attempts to figure out how I can benefits from the anti-aging properties I 've given up . I tried to sleep with it under my pillow , shower with it , hang it around my neck while at work . NOTHING seems to work , I 'm still the exact same age as before ! I need to bring it back . Buyers beware , don't buy this to its anti-aging properties , it 's not work the money .  
  I got this to stop getting up all the time to change disks in my single DVD player . Now I 'm getting up lots more trying to get this to work . Other reviews say it 's slow to respond - they aren't kidding . Push " open " to access the tray and it grinds away for ten seconds deciding what to do . More often than not it 'll stay closed and go back to the movie . Sometimes ( not often ) it freezes completely and has to restarted . Being cheap , it doesn't remember where it was and you have to scan through the movie to find your place . Also ultra susceptible to scratches / fingerprints so the picture stops and jumps frequently . Avoid like the plague .  
  A friend of mine had one of these in college and I envied him . We would take it to the beach , use it for parties . It has a great sound and is a solid device ! So when I saw one reasonably priced , used , on Amazon I jumped on it . I love this thing . Best part is , there 's an auxillary input so you can hook you Ipad into , laptop , etc . Great Buy ! Highly recommended !  
  When used to bounce flash from a ceiling , this product does work . However , when I use it as a direct flash ( 90 degree angle ) it produces shadows and a dark output . I don't know why . I would assume it would diffuse the light and produce even tones .  
  PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO CONTINUOUS LIGHTING UMBRELLA KIT + Free 27 Watts 5500K Fluorescent Photo Lamp BulbThe second one does not match with the first one I bought . Different brand and not the same base . :-(  
  This CD player was a gift for my child . She really liked it and liked the headphones that were included . They were very comfortable unlike products with earbuds . The website needs to include the headphones in the description . I couldn't find any reference to them and took a chance that this CD player would come with them .  
  I have been an avid photographer for 30 years mostly using a 35mm SLR . I also carry a 35mm Nikon point and shoot . I thought a digital camera would be fun but really didn't expect too much from it in terms of quality images . Before buying this unit I read every review I could find on several models and ultimately settled on this one . I have to say that I am surprized and delighted with the capabilities of this camera . Accessing the menus is simple , the controls are easy to use and the pictures are terrific . The camera rests comfortably in your hand with the zoom control handy to your right thumb . To make sure I wouldn't run low on power , I bought 2 sets of Ni-MH batteries and a charger the same day I got the camera . I take nearly every shot with the display turned off and I don't have a single complaint about battery life . Since I started looking for a digital camera , I have been paying more attention to other people using theirs ' and I can't believe how many people use the display when they are shooting pictures . No wonder the batteries run low ! Personally , I can't see how they can take pictures like that .. well I guess people like the gadgetry . The software is pretty basic but it installed without a hitch and seems to work perfectly . As far as a reliable , easy to use point and shoot digital camera , I think this one is great ! I also think that some of my older stuff may be collecting a bit of dust except for the most demanding tasks .  
  I was strickly a Palm guy until I saw the Sony Clie . I 've owned both the Palm Vx and m505 . Of course I moved to the m505 because it had colour . The colour wasn't impressive , but it was a plus compared to the Vx . I switched teams and became a Sony guy after seeing the Clie on the web . I 'm somewhat of a gadget guy , so the camera feature was an added plus ( in a PDA ) for me . I have to admit , the colour on the Clie blows the socks off of the Palm . The screen of the Clie is soo much clearer , the processor is faster ( this is really highlihgted when viewing pictures ) , this is generally a great PDA , but .. I do have couple of small points to mention on the negative side . Although the camera is a neat feature , the quality of the picture isn't that great ( but I think Sony has a new generation of PDA / camera coming out soon ) , the stylus is too thin , and on a few occasions my memory stick is not recognized by my Clie , and I 've had to fiddle with it to get it to work . What I 've found is that if the memory stick is left out of the expansion slot for a little while and then re-inserted it will function correctly , then . But , with that said , I still think you get great value for your money with the Sony Clie PEG-NR70v / U.  
  . I agree with " Kman " and " Zombiecrow 's " descriptions . I also am driving them with the Yamaha 5690 receiver . One thing I do recommend is that you buy heavier wire . The included wire is only # 24 and doesn't look like it will do the job adequately . You can get 100 feet of # 16 wire for about $ 20 . Unless you have a large room , that should be enough . I have not noticed a problem with the bass ; perhaps the heavier wire did the trick . To demonstrate the system for friends , I put on the DVD " Gettysburg " and play the final bombardment just before Pickett 's charge . Sounds like you are right in the middle of the Confederate cannons . I adjusted the subwoofer with the manual adjustment on the back to the bass fiddle in a jazz concert DVD . That gave just enough bass . I adjusted the other speakers first using the auto setup with the included microphone . It did an OK job , but I found adjusting them individually with the manual feature made them closer to my personal preference .  
  This is the second one that I 've purchased as a gift . Very easy to use and great value for price .  
  I love it great product A + + + + + + + + + + + + + +  
  Just got one of these to keep in my truck .. my expectations were low and basically blown away once I had the device in my hands . I expected lousy image quality .. it was much better than expected . It 's not a Nikon pro-grade lens but it 's also not $ 2000 . For what I need it for , it 's more than I need . The focusing mechanism is also smooth and easy to use .. I 'll be looking forward to seeing how it holds up over time . For now , I strongly recommend this tool .  
  Top quality , really big . I can fit my Nikon D50 , 70-300mm lense , 28-70mm lense , Samsung DC164 camcorder , tapes , all the chargers , all the cables , all the manuals , and still have room for a little more . I bought this to travel to Europe . I 'm really excited ! I love this bag . The only negative thing is I hate having to unclip those two side clips ..  
  This book is totally useless for beginner . When you read it , you will feel very confused . There are not enough examples and the explanation is not clear . If you really want to learn C , I recommend you the book which called ' Beginning C ' by Ivor Honor . ' Practical C Programming ' is totally useless ! Don't buy it !  
  This really sucks . I bought mine at my school . Like two days later it broke off my keys because the handle thing is made of plastic .. which caused me to leave it at the school computer less than an hour later . NEVER again . I will use Yahoo Mail to transport my data because it can't get LOST . Buy one that is more heavy-duty , NOT THIS !  
  Product does what its supposed to BUT the picture is VERY deceptive . The form factor is 20x worse in real life . It doubles the bulk of the laptop and adds thickness only to the back of the laptop making the whole thing ugly and awkward . I returned mine the same day . If I wanted a VCR , I would buy a VCR .  
  I have abnormally small ears and ear piercings in my cartiledge which make ear buds one of the only options for headphone comfort . These earbuds are great - all the others fall out of my ears and these , with the larger covers to make them fit even snugger , sit wonderfully and don't fall out when I run , go to the gym , etc . I 'm a petite 20something so maybe that explains the discrepency in reviews . But I have been nothing but thrilled with these headphones . FINALLY earbuds that don't fall out of little ears !  
  It astonishes me that Microsoft has become such a huge conglomerate that they can not even support their OWN PRODUCTS . If you read through the many reviews of this product on Amazon , it comes to light that this product is supported on Vista , but not on 64bit Vista . GO FIGURE . My question , then , is this : Why make a second version of an operating system , if almost NOTHING works with it ? Why offer it to consumers , knowing damn well that what you 're selling them won't work with the OTHER things youre selling them ? WHY ? ! ? ! ? To make more money from us middle-class idiots , that 's why . I didn't buy this item from Amazon , but another large retailer , and now I have to return it , because I spent 2 hours trying to track down a way to make this work on my new HP laptop with Vista 64bit . Needless to say , it doesn't work . I guess I could blame myself for buying a computer with 64bit , but still . I shouldn't have to . This product would be amazing if it actually worked . But , unfortunately for myself , and many others like me , it doesn't , and Microsoft obviously doesn't care one way or the other . Because , after all , they got my money for Vista being on this laptop I 'm using right now , and they got my money for a Fingerprint Reader that is made by Microsoft , but not supported by Microsoft . Thanks a lot , Bill Gates and company , you made even more money than you already need .  
  It 's nice to have the appropriate lens hood for what is a relatively expensive lens , unfortunately Canon take advantage of this desire and exploit their loyal customers with over priced bits of black plastic , this is one of those bits of black plastic that you will want but should never have to feel so ripped off when obtaining it . It fits very well , looks good , has a nice furry inner surface , but I suspect that it 's shallow profile means that it will afford little if any benefit to the performance of the lens .  
  The headset I received is not the one pictured . I don't think it is Amazon 's fault . I believe Belkin is the one that changed the headset and gave it the same product number . This one does not correctly fit in my ear like the other previous ones I have ordered .  
  Believe those unfavorable comments about freeze , hang-up , and others ! System would freeze completely . You 'd have to unplug the system to reset to get your disk out . What is most ridiculous thing is Apex 's customer service : it would take you at least 30 minutes on hold before picking up the phone . And , instead of providing you any help on the phone , I guessed the only service they provide is to ask you to return the item for exchange . The operator does not know anything , zip , about the product and the problem ! Don't waste your time ( for transit ) and money ( return shipping and insurance . ) And don't listen to those favorable comments . It & iexcl ; s probably an INSIDE job . Never have had problem with Amazon 's order before , and this is the first time . Now I am having reserve when ordering from Amazon again . Kind of surprised that Amazon would place its reputation with such low quality product and supplier !  
  It 's a great idea , but the device broke after just one year . Also , Ceiva is kind of scummy - they won't refund your yearly subscription fee if you cancel after 180 days - sounds illegal , but who 's going to fight over $ 40 .  
  The manual feed is a pain , it 's one paper feed at a time and it difficult to feed the paper since it 's not a try but a slot - I am also having difficulty printer to tray two , for some reason it keep referring to manual feed even if everything is set to print from ( auto feed or even tray 2 ) . I have three in the office and I will no purchase another one just for this reason .  
  The sound is good while they last , but the build quality of these is NOT good . Neither is the customer service . 1st Pair : A couple of months after buying these , part of the earphone came out along with the cord when I unplugged the cord . I sent the earphones to ultimate ears to get fixed . 2 months later I had not received a replacement pair . They lost the pair I sent in . I kept calling - the ultimate ears rep kept telling me they needed my receipt , which I had sent to them previously . Then the rep said he had to talk to a supervisor and would get back to me . He never did . Finally I called and frankly threw a fit until they got a supervisor on the phone then and there . 2nd Pair : 2 months later I got a replacement - but last week , part of the plastic near where the cord plugs in broke off and now they are unusable again . Rather than go through their customer service again , I am buying some Shures . 3rd Pair : My third pair was a pair of EBs . They broke the first time I wore them . You might think that I mistreated these , having gone through 3 pairs . But honestly , I don't throw these around or pull on the cords or anything like that . Shoddy ! Paul  
  I found it next to impossible to get a good seal in the ear for me - which results in not so great sound .  
  I 've got the " non-talking " version of this scope , but I thought I 'd post this here , too , since everything else is the same .. Everything bad you 've read in the other reviews is all 100 % true . From the lack of tracking , poor go-to ( because it doesn't keep the time after you 've set it ) , to the way over exaggerated magnification claims , shaky mount - all true . I 've had one of these scopes for about 4-5 years ( got it as a gift ) . I used it once or twice but couldn't do anything but look at the moon with it . It went in the attic ( where most cheap scopes end up ) after a short time .. Then I gave it to my sister ( she kept it when I moved - I was going to throw it away ) . She gave it back after about a year because she couldn't get it to focus . Only useful for the moon she says ( couldn't get the computer to work at all - her fault there - read on ) . Since that time , however , I learned a lot about telescopes in general . So when I got it back , I figured out why it wouldn't focus with the included 4mm eyepiece or the supplied 3x barlow . It was WAY out of collimation . Collimation wasn't even mentioned in the manual at all . They assume it is always in collimation . If a scope gets out of collimation it is useless so it is strange not to put it in the manual at all . So I take out the primary mirror and mark the center spot with a red sharpie ( you need to mark the center of the primary mirror for collimation - this one doesn't come pre-marked ) . I put it back in and use a cheshire eyepiece ( used for collimation ) to line up the optics . Now I knew why there were no instructions on collimating . This thing is almost impossible to collimate ! The secondary mirror basically falls out when you loosen any ONE of the set screws ! Anyway after about an hour and fifteen minutes I got it in very good collimation . However , even in good collimation , the 4mm eyepiece will not come into a sharp focus and NOTHING in the 3x barlow will come to focus AT ALL . This is definitely due to very , very poor quality of the supplied eyepieces . I 've tried other eyepieces which make this scope perform much better so I know it is the eyepieces . The 3x barlow is 100 % useless and it is also 100 % plastic ( I think it even has a plastic lens ) . The * only * reason the barlow is in the box is so they can advertise 525x magnification ( 700mm / 4mm * 3 for the barlow = 525x ) . But the useful magnification for any scope maxes out around 60x the aperture ( in inches ) . In this scope 's case that is 180x . The computer works like it is supposed to ( except it doesn't keep the time once you enter it which makes it pretty useless ) . The problem with the computer and " go-to " in general is the user has to know a bit about the sky before it is useful because you have to line up the scope manually on two stars to set the computer . The novice probably can't do this properly . Note , too , that the second star must be found fairly quickly after the first or the settings won't be very accurate ( hard , again , for the novice ) . The most useful part of the computer is using the direction arrows to manually keep an object in view since they slew the scope at a fairly slow rate . So , the user should know a bit about the night sky before attempting to ever use ANY go-to system . First of all , the best way to do that is to buy NightWatch : A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe ( Spiralbound ) by Terence Dickinson . That 'll get you oriented in the night sky and give a good starting point . Second , pick up a good starter scope . A good starter Newtonian ( same style as this scope ) with an object locator ( doesn't automatically move the telescope , though ) is an Orion SkyQuest XT6 . It has twice the aperture of this scope . If you get the XT6 without the intelliscope option it is even cheaper . General rule is buy the bigest aperture scope that your budget allows . Personally , I don't think you need a go-to at first . It is much more fun to be able to read start charts and star hop your way to find those deep sky objects . Very much like the difference between watching a movie vs . reading the book .  
  As others have reported , the case fits properly , but I 'm a bit disappointed in the material used . First , it 's on the slick side - I had a similar case for a different player that had more grip to it , giving it a much more secure feeling in the hand . Second , the material bordering the screen discolored almost immediately ; within a day it went a light yellowish brown . Not the end of the world , but the case is supposed to be light blue and I wonder if it will get worse with use .  
  The card turned out to be horribly slow . The digital camera takes 4-5 seconds to write to it if more than 100 images stored . First we thought it was due to the size of the card , but having bought a viking and a crucial 64 mb compactFlash card we realise that it is not the size of the card , but the brand of card which is making the process slow . We later found following comparison which does seem to support our findings that the card IS SLOW .. $U$  
  Sounds great but will not last more then a few weeks . I have ben through 3 pairs of these and each pair the right ear bud has gone out and then they sound like trash . Waste of money .  
  I would have hoped that my now Amazon would have switched to American made electronics . The adaptor works for now , but I expect that it will break or stop working within 6 months . That is about the length of time for Chinese made products to last . In the future , I would hope that Amazon would identify the country of origin for its electronics so that people could know whether the product was of adequate quality .  
  This product arrived promptly but turned out to be defective . Files were successfully transferred onto the flash drive , but after ejecting the flash drive and reopening it , some of the files were gone or unreadable . I emailed Kingston support and was told the flash drive was defective .  
  I purchased the TV-DVD combo unit for use in the kitchen and was initially very pleased with it . However , shortly after the warranty expired ( 90 days ) , the unit failed to power on correctly . Push the power button .. little flicker .. nothing . I thought Toshiba was supposed to be a respectable brand . The repair shop I talked with suggested that I donate it to a school that teaches electronics repair .  
  I found this ear piece difficult to keep in my ear . It falls out often and turns on very easily when in my purse . I would not recommend this ear peice .  
  I have been using Sony 7506 's forever . So comfortable . So clear . So flimsy . The cord is not detachable , so I have gone through three pair already with the cord always getting loose . Having said this , after doing a lot of online investigations , it seemed that the Sennheiser 280s were rated closest in sound , have a detachable cord ( feature not available in Sonys ) and were supposedly comfortable . They are NOT comfortable . Sure the ear cups swivel and they collapse so you can travel with them , and they sound almost as good as the Sonys , but not AS good .. So , I will have to stick with my clear , flimsy , but very comfortable Sonys moving forward .. Oh well ..  
  This tv does in fact have high failure rate I know I purchased oneJanuary 2 2008 and the tv would turn its self off after only minuetsof watching . Little trouble shooting with Philips shows that the unit had power board failure . Also when you would turn the tv off only the screen would sometime go out the power board would remain on with led lights on the board still Glowing . you can view the green led lights on the board by looking through the vent holes from the back . When the is turned off the lights should go off PER Philips . Sometime mine would sometime they would remain on after turning the unit off . I returned the tv for replacement and the second tv did the same exact thing the TVs were MFG only one month apart . I wounder how many people have this same set that are not even aware of the power board not shouting off ? If I had two sets with same problem you know there has to be many out there with same falure . This tv looks great that is what sold me and the price and the name Philips . I got my refund and purchased a Samsung . after all this and dealing with Philips . When I see the name Philips I turn my head . Never again will I purchas a Philips brand again  
  Buyer beware of this keyboard , terrible performance ! This keyboard experiences horrible performance issues with this keyboard , if the wireless transciever is moved away , this keyboard malfunctions and sometimes will not register key clicks . I 've had to purchase a Microsoft Keyboard 6000 becuase I couldn't take this keyboard anymore . Do NOT buy ! You will regret it !  
  I bought this from Amazon . com and got a USED / RETURNED unit . There were scrteched all over the screen and everything showed signs of used and wear . returned it the next day and guess what ? THEY CHARGED ME FOR SHIPPING . About the TV , the reception was okey . You need to walk around to find a spot for the best receptions . BOTTOM LINE , DON'T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON . COM !  
  I had this model surge protector and it does not clean or filter power ! Call monster cable and ask , you need the better models hts1000 , mkII 3500 , and better for power filtering or conditioning . Good quality surge protector , nice layout but not worth the extra cash , you can buy a just as good quality surge protector for around $ 25 bucks . DO NOT BE FOOLED OR FOOL YOURSELF INTO THINKING THIS SUREGE POTECTOR MAKES VIDEO OR AUDIO BETTER ! I 've seen other reviews thinking it did !  
  This product says " sport " in the title , but it really isn't designed for use while being very active . I run on a treadmill at the gym and the sleeve leaves the Ipod far too floppy on my arm . It really bounces all over the place and becomes an annoyance . The quality of the sleeve 's parts are great , but the design is poor . If you ride a bike or are only lifting weights it will do the trick , but I would avoid it if you are doing anything more .  
  It was easy to set up , but wasn't worth the effort . The DVDs got stuck and the VHS stopped working altogether - after only 2 months .  
  I just installed one of these for a friend and in the instructions Brother tells you that you must use the cartridge before the expiration date on the cartridge package or six months after you place it into the machine . This means that if the machine has been on the store 's shelf for a while your will have to replace the cartridge before it is empty . This also means that you should not purchase additional cartridges so that you can quickly replace the cartridge when it is empty because your backup cartridge also has at least the same expiration date . I would not buy this for anyone that might run into this cartridge expiration issue during a crisis such as getting out a term paper for college or a business offer or presentation at the last minute . You know how things go - it will expire exactly when you need it the most ! I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT ..  
  Overall : some nice features but overall bad . Both the mouse and keyboard need a redesign . Mouse : THe highlight of the pair obviouly . The goal is to cut down on mouse use as this for me at least is what slows me down and makes my hand hurt . I got this package soley for the scroll buttons on either side of the mouse wheel . THe laser is gimmicky but fine . too many functions . THe scroll button is beautiful ( though it gets stuck as another mentioned ) . However the wheel is in the way of the back side button and prevents its use . Get rid of the wheel and now you are talking . THe thumb buttons are more easily accessed without requiring too much motion of the thumb . ( the top middle finger is required to travel way to far past the scroll wheel to be of any use , the thumb is on the borderline of this occurring ) . Again to cluttered . The application switcher is in the middle causing the need to feel your way around the buttons . Application switcher : useless feature as most monitors are large enought to display task bar on the right . I can read all 5 excel files i have open and easily click the one I want . Keyboard : I should have looked closer at this . Arrogantly redesigned . I love my old multimedia keyboard so much more . I programmed in all my necessary websites in the provided web buttons . No web buttons on this keyboard . Now your main programmable buttons are your function keys . Many workplaces already program those for you to work related tasks . I also personally like keyboard short cuts ( cut , past , close ( alt f4 ) . If I were to enable the programmable buttons , I lose my windows close button ( and the f keys are small so hard to hit anyway . ANother big change is the number pad . It has a very non standard bevelling and it looks like the left keys 1,4,7 are fatter than the others . If you type numbers in without looking at the screen ( looking at your data for example ) , the tactile response of the number pad is way off and you will have numerous numerous errors . The highlight is the window scroller on the left . Innovative and takes pressure off your need of the mouse . Oh , BTW the delete button has grown which I originally noticed and didn't care as i use delete alot . HOwever , this displaced the end button ( and I navigate excel very quickly and effectively without mouse using the end button in combination with shifts and cntrls . ) Good bye to the way you use your keyboard with this one . It is a stylized piece of junk .  
  I purchased this Coby product based strictly on the price point and was once again reminded of the old adage , " You get what you pay for . " The screen resolution was terrible . After reading product reviews and looking at demo models at various brick & mortar stores , I purchased a Philips 7 " frame . The pictures are sharp and I love the 4:3 aspect . I use Picasa to reduce my files to 800x600 size and they appear fanatstic on the frame .  
  It worked for about 2 weeks on my Inspiron ( XP ) , but then wouldn't be recognized . I tried downloading the driver from IO Gear , but no luck .  
  I own a Lexmark Z32 ink jet printer . I upgraded my operating system to Mac OSX 10.4.11 and the printer no longer worked . I contacted Lexmark and they responded " Please accept my heartfelt apologies for the problems you are experiencing with your Lexmark product . To the best of my knowledge , there are currently no plans to develop Mac ( 10.4.11 ) drivers to support this model . Thank you for notifying us of this request . " So before you buy a Lexmark , think about whether the company will be there for you .  
  Bought the printer from Staples for $ 149 in 2005 . Bought it because of Lexmark 's reputation and my previous laser was a Lexmark . It is fast - greasy fast - however it sounds like a tank . Initial powerup takes about 30 seconds . Average time to print for text is about 7-10 seconds . Graphics take much , much longer . It seems like Lexmark , to make the printer cheaper , made it dumber . Printing a document with complex graphics ( a picture , PDFs , etc . ) takes forever - it seems . A positive is the 250sheet paper tray . However , when the printer runs out , it keeps spinning a paper grab wheel until paper is loaded . The printer looks nice with a black shell and grey top . . The output bin is poorly designed and printing big documents will result in pages that have to be shuffled and aligned . Oh , the initial toner cartridge is only good for about 2000 pages . Overall , I was disappointed and will probably replace the printer within a year - and not with another Lexmark .  
  Like every other bad reviewer my pair broke within 3 months . I barely even touched them and they just snapped apart . ( Strangely enough , when I got angry and tried to crush them completely they put up quite a fight . ) Good sound , bad quality plastic .  
  Bad product - stay away from - tape buttons don't work-put a tape in for the first time and it fast forwarded , stop button did not work and play did not work , could not get tape to stop - had to take batteries out to get my tape back . I had to send back . If I could have given this a negative star rating , it would have gotten 5 NEGATIVE stars .  
  I bought the printer with this cartridge and it never printed in black ink , only color . Apparently the ink cartridge is defective . I have to buy the entire cartridge including the ink tanks to correct the problem , but the ink tanks themselves are fine . I am unsure about the durability of the product since I have only printed maybe 10 pages until it stopped working completely . And I am a little afraid to buy another and experience the same problem again . I don't suggest buying it .  
  I have had my T / C for 8 months now . It has been a great handheld , but I wouldn't buy another , and wouldn't recommend anyone else buy one . The Good : Excellent thumb-board has led me to largely abandon use of the stylus . Fast processor , great screen , and WIFI mean you can actually surf the internet if you are near a hotspot ( but only if you buy WebProV , the included web browser is poor ) . I always synch with my wireless LAN rather then the cradle , because it is just as fast . The battery is huge ; I usually only charge the unit once a week , and I am a power user ; using it for hours every single day . The bad : construction quality is poor , and there is little quality control ( a " refurbished unit " I was sent arrived nonfunctional , with the case not snapped completely together ) . There is a class problem with LCD screens breaking with little or no torture to the unit ( this is my 4th PDA , and the first I have broken a screen on ) . The PLASTIC case creaks when you push it and the palm flexes ; the halves are not well fastened together ( which might cause the screen breakage ) . There is a gap at the bottom of the screen where the case does not touch the screen . The screen emits a high pitched 400 Hz hum , which has got steadily noisier the longer I have owned the product ( to the point where I can hear it at arms length ) . About 40 % of all palms developed a software glitch which caused the bottom 20-30 pixels of the digitizer to fail after a few months of use ( possibly corrected with a new firmwear upgrade this month ) . The silver paint on the case scratches and wears off easily . The headphone jack is a 2.5 mm mono jack for use with a headset to allow for future VOIP , unfortunately , standard cell phone headsets will not work , as they swapped the connection terminal order on the jack . The Ugly : Palm customer service . I paid $ 40 for an advanced exchange to fix the problem with my digitizer ( covered under warranty ) . It was very painful : 1 defective advanced exchange , 1 promised advanced exchange that never happened , 1 advanced exchange shipped to the wrong address , 2 more promises of advanced exchanges that did not occur , 1 attempt to charge me an additional $ 40 for another advanced exchange , 3 emails threatening charges to my credit card of $ 550 weeks after tracking info on airborne express website indicated Palm had received the returned handhelds at least 7 days prior , 2 promises ( not fulfilled ) to charge back my credit card the $ 40 due to poor service , 7 long distance phone calls totalling 129 minutes . Every call to Palm was the start of a brand new conversation : their system of keeping track of customers does not work . And 2 weeks after I finally got a functional T / C , the screen broke ( and I hadn't even dropped it ) . My advice ? As a user of both palmOS and PPC , I prefer the palmOS ( as long as it has a high-res screen and a fast processor ) . I am not a fan of their construction quality or customer service process . If you need a keyboard ( and I do ) , buy a Sony UX . If you want a good screen , buy a sony TH55 . Stay away from Palm T3 and T / C.  
  My camera went bad from a VERY COMMONLY reported manufacturing defect " camera stabilizer is not available " error message in the model I had . Since this is a common defect from the manufacture , they should have fixed my camera at their expense , but they refused to fix it without me having to pay $ 100 something for their manufacturing defect plus shipping charges ! Don't buy Casio products ! They don't stand behind the quality of their products .  
  The company that made the product is now defunct . I was never able to get my printer to work . It came with a cable that did not work . I bought an IR device that never made a connection and then after contacting the seller , I bought the cable they said to buy . It still does not work .  
  I bought this camera for my twenty year old son for Christmas . The LCD screen broke within two weeks . He sent it to Canon and they said it was caused by impact / pressure , and he would have to pay $ 150 to have it repaired . When I bought the camera there were no negative reviews on this site ; now there are at least seven regarding cracked LCD 's . I think this is a defect that Canon should make right . Until then , I would not recommend this camera or any of the same line .  
  I ordered 3 cables and one was defective . It wasn't obvious and took me a little while to figure out as the problem was intermittent . I didn't bother to send it back or get a replacement since it was so cheap in the first place .  
  It is manually terminated with Cat 5E Belkin cable , nothing more ! I would not recommend this purchase because of the quality and integrity of the cable . The picture of the cable is not what I got from Amazon !  
  I purchased the Sentry HO2.1 headphones a week ago . Beside the fact that it requires batteries to work , they seem like a great deal . The problem : The set that I have are picking-up radio interference . As soon as I turn it on and plug into a device I can hear the same radio station clear as a bell . The strange thing is I don't even have to plug it into a device ; I can just touch the metal contact of the cord to most large metal objects in the house and listen to this one radio station ! I think its some manufacturing defect causing these headphones to behave as a simple bandpass filter and since it has its own power source it just amplifies the interference . Regardless of the cause , it is an extremely annoying problem since no mater what I 'm listening to there is always faint gospel music playing in the background ! Folks I kid you not . I am willing to accept that this is a defect only in the pair that I have , though I would not bet on it .  
  Out of the box these speakers met and exceeded all expectations . I enjoyed them for approximately one year . As other reviewers have noted many fail over time . Time is up , the speakers are back in the box .  
  If you have the address it works great , but if you dont know the exact city that it is located then it seems next to impossible to find a location . While searching for a ski resort in new york i didnt know the city that it was located so i entered search nationwide setting from there the only places that showed up were aspen colorado and vail . Once i finally got the city name it showed right up . Overall works great if you have all of the info already but good luck trying to find something new and the poi database sucks if are not in a big city .  
  These headphones sound great , but after less than nine months of use , the cheap plastic headband is cracking apart , and I 'd give them another week before it breaks down completely . Sennheiser put some great drivers into some comfortable headphones here , but if they have a terrible quality headband , what 's the point ? Given the knowledge that these would utterly wear out so quickly , I would not have bought them .  
  This curling iron is terrible , which is a shame because all the reviews are generally positive . It burns my hair and doesn't curl AT ALL . I 've tried the different heat settings , smaller and bigger chunks of hair and leaving it in for awhile - it just does not work . I have straight fine hair and I have never experienced this problem with any curling iron in the past .  
  I purchased this product to transfer Hi8 to DVD , and was completely disappointed . Video quality is poor at best . Color is particularly bad - washed out , rainbows soaring thru the video , strange artifacts , and bursts of dropped frames ( even though Pinnacle 's software always reported zero dropped frames ) . I don't expect Hollywood DVD quality video , but I know what my source video looks like and this product didn't even look as good as streamed Internet video . I might have tolerated the product with its video problems if it weren't for the audio . Others have reported ' no audio capture ' . I didn't experience this but my captures consistently had 10 to 30 seconds of lag between the video and the audio . This made the product completely useless . I can believe that other reviewers didn't just have wiring problems . The user interface is better than most other products , if not outright brilliant . The feature set looks great but I didn't waste the time to try most of it since the core functionality just isn't there . I am running a 2.8GHz P4 with 512M RAM and 80G drive , so I was well above min specs . I used XP Pro w / SP2 . In fairness , others have reported install problems on XP and I had no such problems . I did have multiple lockups while the software was running , and even Task Manager couldn't always kill it .  
  I use Netgear products exclusively but this is a real dog . I bought the ME101 based on assurances from Netgear support that the ME101 would act as a wireless repeater after a firmware upgrade . it would not configure properly , the configuration utility failed to recognize the bridge even after I specified an IP address and therefore I was never able to upgrade the firmware . It took 4 calls to Netgear support and an escalation before I was told the product would not operate as I had been advised . This product did not perform adequately  
  I bought this item to use with my Nikon D200 and a ProFoto studio flash . It seemed like everything plugged in okay , but the flash synch is not reliable . It works perhaps 25 % . I 've sent Wein three e-mails about this , but all have been apparently ignored . Also , this item is not very durable , even if it did work reliably . It is definitely not up to professional standards .  
  The extended handle of my " Targus OCN700 15 Side Access Notebook Roller " was broken in my first trip . The handle bars were stuck inside the bag and now could be extended only by 2/3 of its full length . Once it was stuck inside , it was impossible to fix or even just check out . I got really disappointed and want to warn anybody considering to buy it .  
  These are just OK in my opinion-the burn speed is too slow to be really useful . No other problems with them though .  
  I went to replace this battery in my CoolPix P5100 and could not get the battery out of the camera normally . I finally had to force the battery out . It was just in time also , because the battery had swollen in the middle on front and back . It is a genuine Nikon EN-EL5 battery and the camera has never been in extreme heat . This is to warn people to check this battery more often than you would another battery . I am trying to find the Warranty Period if anyone knows .  
  This is one item I should have returned . There was a short in the wire or something so most of the time I had to fiddle with it just to get it to come on . Changing stations - forget it - if I had to touch the thing , it was too sensitive and would shut off and I 'd have to keep turning it back on . It finally died completely on me recently . Nice sleek design but what a disappointment .  
  I ordered the AR wireless speaker and headphone combination . They were shipped separately . The headphones arrived first and work as desired . Today the speaker came . I set it up according to the directions and by chance selected the same channel the headphones were on . The XMradio , which the headphone transmitter was attached to , immediately came through the wireless speaker . I am debating whether or not to order another speaker to get stereo . The quality is as expected from a plastic bucket , as another reviewer called it . To be used as a weather-proof outdoor speaker it will perform as expected . I am completely satisfied , but can only give a 4 as I 'm not over-whelmed with having to use 8 size C batteries with it . Edit - the speaker went south . It no longer works and is thrown away . I would not buy another . I now would give it less than a one star if I could change it .  
  What the heck ! I thought I was getting a stylus that would fit in my Palm . This is a full size pen and doesn't do me any good for travel . It defeats the whole purpose of just carrying a Palm - now I have to carry my Palm and a pen .. ? I don't think so . Where is that return label ..  
  This printer is useless . Lid hinge tabs were broken , paper feed upper guide was missing , ink carrage sticks & noisy causing printing to waver . Should have been sold for parts because that is exactly what I have to is make 1 printer out of my old one using parts from this junk . Should have gone to E Bay !  
  This is a standard a . v . selector , made by monster cable . Monster cable does make some of the best cables around , they are all I use for my audio , even though they are a lil pricey . But monster means quality . But .. Its just not worth the price tag on this thing ! For top of the line quality nothing beats this , but if you can afford this then you can afford a t . v . with 4 s video inputs such as the top of the line sony wega , so why not spend your money on that ? Its good quality , but I think I 'll spend my money for the $ 50 rca one , or even find another one for less , but if you got money to burn on a selector , go ahead , but the money can buy alot better things .  
  I bought these a few months ago . They seemed to be a great improvement over the predecessors the Shure E2C 's and a set of Sony Earbuds . The sound is great , these have great clarity and range . The problem is they start to irritate your ears if worn for more than about an hour . I tried every different size adapter and still , ouch ! The second thing is that now they have fallen apart . The wires started to seperate at the jack and eventually broke leaving only the strain relief to hold the the jack on . The last thing is characteristic of all earbuds . This is the separation of the rubber ear interface from the earbud . I would take them out of the little gold bag and the little rubber earpiece would going flying off and leave me to hunt the floor of the airplane cabin to retrieve it .  
  I bought this as a gift for my grandson , and it failed on the first attmpt to use it - swallowed a VHS tape and would neither play nor eject it . The design concept is good , but quality control seems to be non-existent . Back to Sears it goes , and shame on them for carrying the line .  
  Things you find out once you can't make something work and then read the manual .. 1 . There is no native 720p . It downscans it to 480p . 2 . The PIP , auto-off on no-signal , and double-display and still-screen functions only operate on tuner input and Svideo . If you use the progressive inputs NONE of those functions will work . 3 . The TV powers on in tuner mode ( not in " last source used " mode ) . It takes 8.5 seconds ( timed by my Pronto ) from hitting the power button before you can switch it to any alternate input source ( Svid , RCA , Component .. ) 4 . The sound output ( monitor outs ) do NOT work when the component video inputs are selected . In other words , if you use Svid to feed the sources , you can use the TV to feed audio as one source to your audio system . If you use Component , you have to individually feed the audio directly into your audio system and separately switch them . Mine was ordered 3/22 , given to shipper 3/23 , delivered4/7 ( yes , it took over two weeks ) , and the shipper triedto do a curbside delivery untilI " explained " that they could either do the white glovedelivery that was called for and paid for , or they couldtake it back . It 's a good interim until plasma HDs come down in price , but if you 're looking for a long term HDtv , you may wantto wait for true 720p , 1080p , monitor-out on all sources , powerup with previous source selected , multiple savedconvergence settings ( standing , sitting , couch-right , couch-left , etc . ) E  
  Unknown brand was received , not C2G . There are no actual markings on the cable itself to indicate contents , however the cable is noticeably thinner than the real C2G cables purchased directly from Amazon on the same day . It isn't worth the effort to send back , nor use this mystery cable . And other than to say " avoid choosing Amamax for your C2G purchases " , its not worth writing another word for this review .  
  Sound was great but did not last any longer than cheep ear plugs . The wire connection cut out after only a few weeks of using .  
  The mouse that was delivered was not the one that is listed in here ! Contact the seller and they keep on avoiding me . Buy from them at your own risk . :(  
  THIS toy gets me so mad you charge is for 15 houres and 2 min 's after you take it off the charger the battery died . I threw mine out the windows . I hate cybikos never buy one . I dont care if its free do not get one  
  First , I must say that the shipping was fantastic . It was delivered before the estimated delivery date . Props on that one . Now to the headphones . Horrible . Just horrible . When I took it out of the package , it felt like it 's only worth maybe 10 dollars . I thought " ehh . It just feels cheap . " But as soon as I played a song AT 75 % VOLUME , there was few , if not , no bass whatsoever . Sounded muggy and unclear . Oh , and another thing . The right ear had a buzzy noise to it . I think I got a used pair . I returned them right when I got it . IT was that bad . So I invested in a top of the line Audio Technica M50 's . If you want quality , please don't be cheap . But if you just want some sort of device that can play back music , be my guest and pick this one . I recommend all of you to read this whoever is looking for quality .  
  The cartridges are expensive and run out very quickly . Changing cartridges requires a study of multiple lights - is one flashing or not ? The paper loader is finicky . It finally jammed in a way that it could not be fixed and , if it could , it would not be worth the cost of the repair . Best news is that my retailer exchanged the now-useless cartridges , of which I had to keep four in stock . No wonder this model has been discontinued . To those who own one , per the science officer in ' Alien ' : " You have my sympathies . "  
  I started having problems within a week of purchasing this item . The fans would just randomly stop working . I would have to tap on it and set it a certain way on the table for them to start working then , in the middle of a game / work / email etc I would shut down due to overheating because the fans stopped working . I realized if I maneuvered the cord a certain way the fans would come back on so this is how I used it for about a month and it not only stopped working 70 % of the time but after about 2 months I could no longer plug it in , the little metal thing that you plug the cord into was gone .. if I shook it I could hear it rattling around inside . I did not save the packaging and do not have my receipt but I know I paid over $ 30.00 for this piece of crap . Please , I am begging you , donate the money to charity before you throw it away on this product ! I couldn't choose less than 1 star .  
  I purchased this camcorder / digital camera in May 2002 and found that it takes excellent video , is easy to use , and seemed to be a good value . Unfortunately my good first impression came to an end . Despite every trick known to a computer geek and following Panasonic 's instructions to the letter , I cannot get the camera to " talk " to my PC . Therefore the digital camera function is worthless to me now . Panasonic 's product literature states the Windows 95/98 / Me / 2000 OS is required . I am using Windows XP . So I went to Panasonic 's website to download the newest iteration of the software but that didn't solve the problem . I called Panasonic 's customer service and despite numerous busy signals , finally reached a rep who was basically clueless . It might be the cable , but I don't want to buy a new one . I 'd really like Panasonic to solve the problem !  
  Shipping delays aside i returned this because of its condition . It looked almost obviously used , had a scratch on the threads . Needed a severe cleaning at best . Outer edge of filter had indication of usage & prior ( attempted ) cleaning . Generally in poor shape & possibly the poorest looking filter i 've had shipped to me . I tend to doubt the one i recieved was new / unopened retail . I 'm not sure what happened . It appears it was originally out of stock & they may have shipped it from overseas . Some one probly just tossed it together . Difficult to say this is a ' review ' of the product as i doubt the condition mine showed up in is normal . Can't recommend ordering it from here though .  
  I have had such a lousy experiance with this machine . I have burnt about 2 cds and wasted atleast 30 other cds trying to get this machine to burn . It takes forever to burn and then when it is almost done it just says there is an error and you 've wasted 20 minutes on a cd that didn't burn and is not usable . I went through customer service and customer support and they kept telling me to do the same things that they told me to do the time before when I went for help . Save your money and buy a different brand . I have lost all faith in HP products as of now .  
  I bought this router because of its ridiculously low price ( .. ) And I too have heard good things about the Netgear brand . The device only took 2 minutes to set up with RCN 's cable modem ( dynamic ip ) , and the web config interface is simple . But the wireless connection dies intermittently , sometimes as often as several times a day ! I have to go over to the router , unplug it , and plug it back in to reset it . Afterwards it works fine . If you 're at home , it 's a minor nuisance , but if you 're running a server or need to connect to your network when nobody 's home to reset the router , DON'T BUY THIS .  
  I bought this for my Mom . Broke after warranty period , bought second one at reduced rate . Broke again due to power supply , Broke again - pictures would not download . Cieva recommended another power supply . New power supply faulty . This product is a great idea , but due to poor quality it is a MONEY PIT .  
  Not as spected , for the almost $ 100.00 , NO a good purchase . Bad in the high frequencies . I did not get a crispy sound . My cellphone ( Sony Ericson ) that I got for FREE came with a better sound headphones . 30 will be a good price . I do not recommend these headphonesThanks  
  I 'm re-editing my previous review . I initially gave it 4 stars because at first I was pleased with the mouse but wasn't sure on the battery life . I 'm on my 2nd Targus mouse and it SUCKS ! Never buying this again . The battery life is terrible and about a week after I used it wirelessly - it never worked again without being connected to the USB cord . It 's not like I used this mouse everyday either - I took good care of it , kept it in the pouch it came with and it just never worked as well as it did after the first week . I 've tried re-charging etc but this product is not worth buying . If I knew then what I know now , I would have saved the money and just bought a Mac mouse . You 'll have a worthless mouse after a couple of uses and although it is very easy to use , it becomes less of a useful accessory and more of an annoyance . I would never ever buy this mouse again .  
  With minimum use the system stopped working correctly after about three months . Would receive frequent " unlock scanner " messages on console eventhough scanner wasn't locked ( I never even used the scanner ) . Became so frustrating .. Support was useless and non-responsive from the company . Wouldn ; t recommend this product to anyone .. I thenbought an HP PSC850 to replace it .. no problems yet and am happy with it  
  I purchased this card in 12/01 . After a very quirky install , the card worked well for 4 months and then went dead . It took numerous phone calls to get an RA . It then took Creative 4 months to return the card , which still didn't work . A few more phone calls and a new card arrived . After working for 3 months , died . I marked the card and returned for repair / replacement . After 4 months I received the same card back , not working . I was then sent a 5.1 card that I couldn't hook-up to the front panel . I am now junking this card and trying a new product . Will never use a Creative product again . I could excuse the problems , but not the shameful lack of customer support and service .  
  Second region free DVD that I purchased from this vendor - while they both started out fine after a short time they would only play non-region 1 disks . Region 1 disks for the US started skipping . I thought that maybe it was a fluke with the first unit but it is the same with the second unit ( different brand ) . I am not happy .  
  Save your money , Dont buy this TV . Below is an email i sent to Phillips customer sevice and still waiting for response . To whom it may concern , I have purchased a Phillips 50 in plasma TV ( 50PFP5332D / 37B ) in August 2007 . Eleven months ( July 2008 ) later TV broke and it was replaced by refurbished unit after 40 days of wait ( The TV was still under warranty ) . Today ( February 2010 ) TV broke again for what it seems exact problem . The " relay " was clicking and then TV just died . That is what exactly happened in July 2008 . I am very disappointment customer with Phillips product . This is unheard that same TV ( same model ) dies twice in 3.5 years . My last TV ( Sony ) was replaced after 17 years and it still works ! Obviously there is questionable quality of the Phillips TV . I will never purchase another Phillips product . Disappointed customer ,  
  Ink cartridge runs out fast . I wish they use a bigger cartrige for the printer .  
  While these are very stylish , with the silver / black metal buds and plug , andthe piece that keeps the cords from separating .. and they DO form a nice seal , blocking out ambient noise nicely , and do have nice bass .. where is the treble ? The whole idea of spending a bit more , for me anyway , was to get a better , more realistic reproduction of the sounds I wanted to hear .. But while you get the bass , which is IMPORTANT , it is at the sacrifice of the higher end of the range . There is either a serious variation in quality from set to set , or else some of the reviewers simply are not audiophiles , and are not aware of what is missing . I will be contacting Amazon to ask for a refund , and my search continues .  
  I bought three of these so we can show off our new baby to her grandparents via skype . 1 . They are quite blurry . It 's fine if you 're sitting still and talking , but after any kind of motion the picture will be very bad for around a second . 2 . One grandparent , on Windows XP , managed to install the drivers that came with the CD instead of downloading the most current ones . As a result , she was sending terrible static bursts every few seconds . Upgrading the driver fixed the issue , but it took an hour of painful over-the-phone debugging to discover that this was the problem . 3 . We often have trouble with the audio cutting out . Probably this is a bandwidth problem , but we all have " good " internet service ( cable modems or fiber ) . If I had it to do over again , I would pay some extra to buy something better .  
  I sent the brackets back . They would not have worked with the speakers that came with my Home Theatre System . I tried , but they didn't work out . I also wanted to mount them on a brick wall . I ended up sending them back and using the floor mounts that came with the Home Theatre System . I should have known .  
  I 'm not seeing as much improvement in signal reception as I had hoped . Areas that were receiving acceptable signals before now show stronger reception . Areas that were marginal before show little improvement despite all efforts at antenna placement and aiming .  
  I bought this product for my 6 years old kid , it work for a month . After that , the battery lost its charge and did not get charged . The AC adaptor wont work , the battery not charge , for that reason a portable DVD is not longer portable . Toys R us is responsible for offering a product from a company that does not have any quality control and released a faulty product . Also Toys R us did not take any responsibility for selling this product . I will not buy any other electrical device at Toys R us . In Puerto Rico we always say " Cheap things are dearest "  
  I could not agree more on the issue brought up here . As if there were not already enough memory formats , yet another one . It seems to be about either desperate , or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever . Why can't we just have one or two formats of memory ? This is as bad as it would be to have 5 + formats of CD-RoM drives . And SONY is even more guilty than fuji / olympus . Smartmedia was developed by Toshiba / Fuji / Olympus , and now Fuji / Olympus couldn't get along with Toshiba / Panasonic for the sD card . Memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices . We need to standardize the market . We can't afford to buy special memory for each and every device . If you buy Fuji / 0lympus , I sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xD . Together the people can control the market for our own good ..  
  We purchased this player to take on a family vacation for my two children to watch movies while we made a 12 hour drive . We used it several times for approximately 2 weeks prior to leaving and loved it . An hour and a half into the trip we turned it on and there was no sound . No matter what we tried the sound would not come on . The kids were really bummed and it made for a much longer trip for them as they were greatly dissapointed . I refused to try another one from Initial and just got a refund . I am waiting on my Mintek to arrive .  
  It worked once when first connected and then it self destructed . I get nothing but static . Static on every station option . Static on every IPOD setting . This FM Transmitter is a big , big disappointment .  
  I got this install kit for my 95 Chevy S-10 Blazer , but once I opened it I immediately knew that it was the wrong one for my truck , just from the size of the area in my truck compared to the install kit . On the outside of the package and on the description says this will fit a 92 ' and up , but this is the wrong kit for my truck . Then when you look at the intruction booklet for my type of vehicle , it says this kit is for a 02 to 04 . Wish there was a better way to make sure that this type of kit will fit before ordering , now I gotta worry if the seller will accept the product after I opened it . Hopefully the wire harness I ordered is the right one . I wished I woulda just got this from somewhere it was easier to exchange .  
  I purchased these headphones 6 months ago . For the first three months I was pretty happy with them . Great sound quality , they really reduced outside noise on noisy bus rides I take , and they were light and easy to carry . However , while taking them off my head , they broke . The plastic piece holding the earphone simply snapped . I wasn't too rough with them or anything . Reading the warranty more closely , I discovered it said " Invalid in the United States and Canada . " This is a European company so apparently the product is not warranted in the US.I am going to try sending them back to a service center here in the states , but I would never buy these headphones again . They are too cheaply made . If you spend $ 50 , your headphones shouldn't break .  
  I just bought this dvd player from costco and it makes alot of noise loading disc . and played only 1 out of 5 disc I tried . Sometimes it would just spin and not do anything and other times it would do nothing when I pressed play . I am returning for another . I hope o just got a bad one  
  I bought this product to convert my rather large collection of VHS tapes to DVD-R discs . With the Toshiba name and some good reviews , I thought I had made a smart purchase . I was wrong . Sometimes , when dubbing , it continues to play the VHS tape but it stops recording without any on-screen notification ! Sometimes I get the " Video input system changed " message that others have reported , but it usually happens that I watch 2-3 hours of tape only to find that the unit recorded a whopping 5-10 seconds . If you want to dub your old tapes to disc , then your money will most likely be better spent on a product from a different manufacturer . Shame on you Toshiba !  
  Antonline has the 256mb card for this price . Advertising should be corrected as it is not correct .  
  One of the reasons why I bought this product was that I thought it would look good stacked atop my apple TV . Sure enough , it does look good . But I also bought the product because I needed an HDMI switcher to use my Cable Box , PS3 and Apple TV through the same input . The product worked for about a week and then completely died ! It would not turn on , which after reading other reviews , seems to be a pattern . I called Xtreme HD support and , once I was able to actually get them to answer the phone , they were useless . There support dept . gave me a number to call ( fox media I believe ) who I was told deals with there warranties . I called that number and the support specialist told me that they are not the company to talk with , and to call another number . The number they gave me was for Memorex who , for some reason , does warranties for Xtreme HD . Since I did not have my proof of purchase ( deleted the email ) , I was told that I could not return the product and that I was simply out of luck . I will never buy another Xtreme HD product again .  
  the baterries are more bigger than varta 217 , i need the same baterry , you not have VARTA 217v ?  
  I have to agree with many of the other reviews I have seen . I would give the product ( and company ) zero stars if that was an option . The TV picture is OK , but the DVD player is almost useless . mine will not even identify that a disc is in it now . I did know that my unit was out of warranty when it brokedown . But I had emailed the company for some troubleshooting suggestions on how to overcome the difficulties with the DVD . They would not even reply to the email . So I will quickly be replacing this TV / DVD with a brand that works and will never buy an Apex product again .  
  I bought this printer in April after reading many positive reviews . It was easy to set up-even for a " technophobe " like me . I managed to get it to execute all its functions ( text printing , photo printing , scanning and copying ) without calling one of my children for help . Like any inkjet printer , it seems like I had to replenish the ink supply all too soon-but that goes with the territory . Then , the other day , I tried to print something off the web and up comes this message on my computer screen , " Service error 6B10 " I turned off the unit and disconnected the power cord as suggested by the manual but I kept getting that message . Then I called tech support ( also suggested by the manual ) . After a mercifully short hold time of a minute or two , a pleasant technician had me verify that there was no paper jam and then told me that my unit would need servicing . Since it was still under warranty , I could have Cannon ship me a refurbished model and I could ship them back my printer or I could take it to a computer repair shop and have them fix it at Cannon 's expense . I chose the second option . These printers have been out for less than a year and already Canon has a supply that have had to be " refurbished . " This makes me think that this model has some real design flaws or , as I said to the tech support person , it 's junk .  
  Firstly , You have to apply A LOT of pressure to the 2.5 plug into the usb dongle in order for it to completely be plugged in , I was a little afraid that I was going to break it during this process because the construction seems pretty cheap . The product I recieved has a 3 inch usb dongle and a headset with a cable that is approximately 4 to 4.5 feet in length , which contradicts some of the reviews for this product as well as the pictures that are shown for this product . The review that I read stated that there were two parts to the cable , the 1st being about 4 feet long plugs into the 2nd part that is about 5 feet long bringing the total cable length to about 9 feet long . That is what I expected to recieve , but somehow I didn't . I spoke with a plantronics customer service rep and he claimed that he had the exact same product ( mx500i ) in front of him and that the cable was as long as his desk , which he said was about 12 feet long . He said that amazon . com was giving misinformation about the product and / or selling a different product than the mx500i . I asked him if the product specifications had changed for this model and he denied that the product specs have ever changed . The model number on the box of the product I recieved says mx500i . The product documentation from plantronics website along with the packaged documentation that I recieved with this product is EXTREMELY vague to say the least . DO NOT expect to recieve what you see in the photos for this product , nor what many of the reviews state about this product . I 'm not sure where to put the fault of this but never-the-less I 'm disappointed because I didn't recieve what I was expecting to , thus the bad review . Other than that the product seems to work alright , but its a little rediculous because I cannot sit more than 3 feet from my 24 inch lcd , which gets a little hard on the eyes . The plantronics representative also strongly suggested that I do not try to add a 2.5 audio cable as an extension because it would most likely yeild detrimental results . I 'm going to take a chance and order a 2.5 extension anyways . My suggestion to amazon . com and / or plantronics , get your stuff straight and inform your customers about what they are going to recieve correctly .  
  This being my first wireless kb / mouse set , I 'm presuming maybetoo much by assuming that this sort of behavior does not occur inthe other main technology ( believe it 's RF wireless ) that isused .. I would think by now that any kinks that may have been in a priorgeneration of bluetooth devices would no longer be an issue inthis one ( response time , connection , battery life ) , butunfortunately , this set has all those issues and more . At first , the keyboard was ok , but I had numerous occasions wherethe mouse would lose connection , sometimes for more than a fewminutes . Nothing I did would fix the issue ( like attempting amanual reconnect ) . Almost on cue , if I used the mouse for about4-5 hrs straight , it would seem to lose connection due toinadequate charging . The keyboard is mainly for looks IMO , the lcd display is moreof a gimmick than anything else . But the keyboard did have alot of nice programmable keyboard shortcuts , although I tendedto accidentally hit the mute button on the lower left a lot . But now , after only 1 1/2 weeks of usage , the keyboard batteriesare already drained to the point where I have keypresses repeatthemselves . I tried using rechargeables , but I have to almostchange them out everyday . You 'll know when the keyboard batteriesstart being inadequate when you keypress and then you get 4-8repeats of the same key . I don't know if I 'm expecting too much out of this wireless setsince this is my first wireless set and I do tend to use thecomputer for at least 6 hrs a day . I don't believe it 's adefective product . But I did not expect it to be this bad , especially with one of the newer generations of bluetoothequipment . Again , I 'm assuming it 's mainly the bluetooth . I havenot seen similar issues with the RF sets that my friends use . My last comment - I ended up putting the bluetooth usb dongleon the front of my computer , which seemed to improve theconnection to the mouse . However , after doing that , any time Itry connecting other usb devices to the 2nd usb port on thefront , the computer no longer recognizes the device . Somehow , the bluetooth device either screwed the usb port up , or maybeis draining more than a usual amount of power ? Anyhow , I would highly recommend anything else out thereunless you want a very elegant , compact , and troublesome wirelesskb / mouse combo .  
  I agree with the previous rating .. we must bring that star rating of three down ! This router .. I don't even want to call it a router .. This contraption is a complete waste of money ! I know it 's cheaper than many others , but gosh ! It 's not worth the twenty dollars I paid ! It loses the connection every 2-3 minutes . That 's ridiculous considering my pc is only about four feet ( and with a clear path ) from the thing . The router gets so hot after about 30 minutes , the base may actually burn you . Do not even conjure up the idea in head to consider buying this ! Congrats , Belkin ! You have out done yourself with this piece of s * t !  
  Great headphones , love the sound quality but after one warranty covered plug replacement it went bad AGAIN after the warranty expired . Vmoda offered me 50 % off if I buy the new model from them ( which happens to get them close to the price here at amazon ) but I 'm steering clear . Stay away from this company unless you like music in just one ear .  
  I may gave this product 5 star if I wrote this review in its first week for its amazing charging speed , however after a year 's usage , I am not hesitate to give 0 star , for the endless trouble it bring to me . First of all , this charger has a huge adapter which is not displayed in the picture , what make it even worse , it is only 110V capable , which means it is not working in other country which has 220V voltage . So travllers be aware , this is definitely not what you want . Then I found these batteries discharge very quickly , leave the battery a couple days unused , you will found they are empty in just several shoots in my digital camera . My latest find is this charger greatly shorten the battery life . Now all of the 4 AA batteries are died in just 30 cycle recharging , comparing ordinary rechageable batteries have 500-1000 recharging cycle . I finally decided to buy a new one to get me out of these troubles since I do not wish to miss the precious shot any more .  
  Hi , I have had the VDR-D300 for about 6 months now . I have never gotten a recording session to last more than about 20 min . The camcorder constantly locks up , usually after about 10 min . This is on a full battery - the unit never gets even to a battery alarm . Several times the reset button nor the reset proceedure per the manual works . I must have a faulty unit . I 'm investigating repair . The unit has a great lens , camera , and video image , but my unit is not stable at all .  
  I could not get this to work with my 5G iPod Classic no matter what settings I tried .  
  I received this item . I must have misunderstood the terms , because I thought I was buying " new " unit . Unfortunately , I have experienced difficulties with the unit pretty much from the time I received it . It is now not functioning ( device is not recognized by my USB port ) . Seller has not been very communicative , and to date has not responded to my request for repair or replacement . I recommned that you source your ipods elsewhere .  
  Finally got around to assembling this . Ordered it too long ago to return , or I would . Thought this was the same pit a friend had got .. But it is a cheap knockoff . Thin metal , poor alignment of the screw holes and the seams . Rim around edge is multiple pieces and screwed on instead of welded on . So are the legs . Doesn't come with a cover .. And you don't want to get water in this so you need to get one . Overall .. Disappointed . I will use it .. But it looks like it will wear / rust out in a couple of years and I will need to replace it . Suggest you search for similar items that are better made .  
  DANGER : 2-prong plug can lead to electrocutionUpdate 12/16/05 : Syntax 's response to my Better Business Bureau ( BB ) complaint said , " We talked to the customer and the customer accepted the resolution . " In fact , they did not talk with me . I note that their BB score is now a ` D ' . Original review ( 12/12/05 ) : Too good to be true ? I plugged it into a 2-slot electrical outlet . ( Such ungrounded electrical outlets are common in older homes . ) Careful ! My unit had 120 volts on the coaxial ( cable ) input . Accidentally , I touched the cable to my stereo case , and it had a HUGE spark . It must have enough current to give a dangerous shock . After one-half a day of calling ( 12/12/05 ) , I finally was able to talk with Miguel . He said I had a grounding problem . Eventually , their engineer , Joe , returned my call . Joe said that 120 volts on the chassis was not a defect . Although , he would not accept the unit as a return , he thought it was a good idea to return it to Amazon . Joe indicated that the unit must be grounded , and it would not be uncommon for an ungrounded unit to have 120 volts on the chassis . Appliances should never produce 120 volts on the chassis , even if the ( center ) ground post is removed . ( Read for yourself ; search for " how stuff works 2 and 3 prong plugs " . ) Apparently , the unit has a " hot " wire touching the chassis . It seems the Joe ( or Syntax ) does not want to admit to a defect in the product . I recommend that you do NOT purchase the product unless you have a grounded 3-prong electrical outlet . Additionally , I recommend you consider their customer service . Call Syntax . See how long it takes to talk to a human . I called for one-half a day . They have an odd answer system . Even if you choose to " talk to the operator " , you will have to leave a message . Eventually , I did speak to Miguel . Then , Joe called me . However , it took all day . ( I first called at 8:00 PST ; finally , Joe called me at 3:15 PST . ) It 's too bad . The unit seems to have good color . The sounds is a bit odd , but can be configured . It does not have good reception . On many channels received by my old TV , this unit goes to blue screen and indicates " no signal " . If it were not for the defective ( and dangerous design ) and for the poor customer service , I would recommend the TV as a good value . However , I 'm not risking my house , or my other electronics to this poorly designed unit . Check the voltage on your unit 's coaxial ( cable ) input before connecting to you cable , least you damage other TVs or receivers on your cable .  
  This adapter does NOT fit well with the shuffle - the connection is loose and requires moving the iPOD around to get some level of connection . The connection is bad when you are able to find some connectivity . Don't buy it , unless they make the male portion of the adapter TRULY compatible with the female jack on the Shuffle . This was a waste of money .  
  Not Nikon , cheap knock-off , passed off as original Nikon cap . Spend the extra three or four bucks to get factory Nikon cap with free shipping ! ( shipping was more expensive than this cap )  
  I only got a strong signal with 2 Macs for about 10 ' with the Netgear MR 814 . Also Netgear does not provide the 24/7 tollfree tech support they advertise if you have an Apple setup . I cannot recommend this for folks with Macs who want to share a Cable connection .  
  Be aware ! You won't get a " Cables To Go . " It 's some non-branded cable . I was hoping , at least , it would work with gigabit speed , but iperf reported the same speed as my old Cat5 cable ( under 100Mbps ) with my gigabit router and Ethernets in my local network ! And yes , since it 's not shipped by Amazon , you have to pay the return cost . Here is the seller ( Amamax ) explanation about this cable , " The 100mhmps depends on your internet speed you pay for on a monthly basis " item received was one of our 4 cat 6 ' branded cables which should be identical to the specs of a CTG maybe better with a thicker inner core of copper "  
  After reading all of these reviews and getting really excited before and after my purchase of these earbuds , I was sure I 'd found the best pair of earphones I 'd ever own . I certainly paid enough for them . They make headsets for famous performers .. and almost every reviewer gives them 5 stars ! What more could a music lover want ? However , I am disappointed . And I really hate that I am . My earbuds arrived yesterday , and after over an hour of meticulous experimentation with all of the included ear pieces , and finding the best seal possible , the sound was not acceptable for this price range of headset . I could be accused of just not finding the proper seal at this point , but I manually pushed and held them in my ears to determine the ultimate listening experience if they were as snug and secure as possible . They just sounded too empty , very far from " rich " .. like something was missing . They were quite clear , but the bass was lacking . And I specifically got the 5 's instead of the 3 's because of the reviews that said the bass was perfect in this next step up the price ladder . I 've never considered myself a " basshead " or even an audiophile , but the full , enriched audio experience which these reviews and the product manufacturers promised was not what I got . My V-MODA Bass Freq earbuds were better ( until they shorted out ) . I listened to Bjork while testing and my Phillips headphones that came with a cd player from 5 years ago that I stored as a lackluster backup were better ( but they 're almost fully shorted out too ) . The sound fullness just isn't there . As soon as we jumped in my boyfriend 's Infiniti and listened to the same music on his Bose speakers on the way to Taco Bell , I knew that I hadn't just been hallucinating . I kept trying to convince myself that they were awesome , and that I must not be listening correctly somehow . But I think they just aren't that great . A few other reviewers have pointed this out too . Perhaps I should have gotten the Extended Bass model .. ? At any rate , I just took them to the post office to get a refund .  
  The audio technica ATH-ANC7 did not work nearly as well as passive noise reduction like I get from the Peltor H10A Earmuff . I sent them back .  
  I have had to replace my iPod mini three times ? ! I have not so much as dropped it . Sometimes the battery appears to be fully charged but the iPod will cease playing in the middle of a workout . Sometimes the display light will come on by itself in the middle of the night ? ! Plugging the iPod in will sometimes rectify the problem .. sometimes not . I 've been told it is a battery issue . In addition to the iPod being possessed I 've found that I have too much music to store on this little guy . Perhaps its larger brethren are more hearty .  
  This battery ( EN-EL5 ) is a fake one . It came without the tridimensional signal and works for 10 clicks or 20 minutes in standby ( the original works for almost 300 clicks ) . FAKE , FAKE , FAKE ! IT 'S A SHAME !  
  Big on promises , none delivered . The most use part of this product is the cardboard box that can be used to ship it back . I am very tech capable and I knowledgeable . The USB port is useless . NO USB drives will work on this thing so you can only record on SD cards which aren't big enough to record on the best setting , but if you get a bigger SDHC card you have to use an adapter which goes into the useless USB port . See the constant circle of frustration . All storage has to be formatted with FAT32 but even if you do , it still wont work . It will hang up and stop recording constantly and in only 2 days of ownership has locked up and frozen 5 times . Please do not buy this , tell everyone . Save your money and buy the DVDs this thing is a waste of time , money , patience , sanity , USB drives , space , air , chips , plastic and cardboard . Oh but the batteries for the remote were the only things that worked .  
  I purchased a PQI memory card and it died after about two months . Although PQI advertises a lifetime guarantee on their memory products and their website has you fill out an RMA request form and email it to them as an attachment , the email address they give is invalid . All subsequent emails to PQI regarding the invalid email address and warrantee processing were not responded to . According to the Better Business Bureau " this company has an unsatisfactory record " .  
  I ordered one strip of Viking DL1356 512MB for my Dell Inspiron 600m , the machine that this memory model is supposedly designed for . The DL1356 memory continuously freezes my computer . I even tried having the DL1356 installed without any other memory strips ; still froze my computer . I should have trusted the_verdugo 's review .  
  I got a new Imac for Christmas and a couple games . Battlefield Pacific , and X plane . After doing some research , everyone was saying how great the Logitech extreme was . And that it works on the Mac . I have to tell ya . It doesn't work on the Mac . There is no support for it , and the only good thing I can say is that tech support at Battlefield Pacific have been great . Though they haven't found a way to make this thing work . It works great on my XP though . So now I have to find a joy stick that works on my Mac .  
  I placed my mac in my living room because there is another pc in my room . I decided to buy a cordless desktop to avoid wires running across the living room . I bought this for cheap at another major store . Once installed it was a hassle to setup and after that it became a pain in the arse . The main culprit is very weak signal . The mouse would jitter ; the keyboard would become unresponsive . It would only work nearly well if I 'm at a distance of 2 feet , at most . Do not buy this if you are unable to get this close to the receiver . This is a very poor product . I recommend the Logitech brand ; it works perfectly .  
  I ordered a pack of 100 Verbatim DVD-R 's because of the high rating they were given . They were not the ' life series ' , and they DID have the AZO layer on it ( not sure what that is ) - since that seems to be the sign of high quality with these discs . I was so excited to try them out , but the very first disc I set to burn was not even recognized . Second one was recognized , burned , and finalized successfully , however when I placed it into my 2 $ 29.99 DVD Players - Memorex ( manufactured in 2010 ) DVD Player and Philips ( also 2010 ) which by the way have played EVERY single burnt disc I 've ever placed in them , Memorex gave me a WRONG DISC error , of which I had NEVER seen on that DVD player , and the Philips simply didn't do anything ( again , never seen it do that ) . Since that day , I 've resorted to burning at 2x just to get them to work , although I 've NEVER had to do this with ANY brand I 've used before . I 've made 100 's of movies with second rate brands , all of which play on my cheap players , and I can think of only a handful that simply wouldn't burn . Just as a test , I burned Wrath of the Titans onto a Verbatim at 6x , and it had pixelization errors when I played it . Did the same burn onto a Philips DVD-R , at same speed , same program , etc , and it came out fine . So , why did I go with Verbatim ? I hear they are high quality and since I give a lot of DVD 's to friends , I wanted high compatibility as well . Now I 'm stuck with 84 Verbatims that I HAVE to burn at 2x or they just won't work . Can somebody please just let me know if you 've had this problem ? I can't be the only one .. these are supposed to be the sh * t when it comes to DVD 's , it can't just be me . Thanks . BTW , out of 16 DVD 's I 've burned so far , 5 messed up .. they either weren't recognized or were recognized and burned successfully but then gave some kind of errors on DVD player .  
  I was very surprised when the left channel stopped cancelling noise completely after a month of very little use . I didn't fly with these phones , or blast music through them . I quietly played jazz on my computer through them while I worked at home . Then the left phone cut out cancelling , and I hear a sound similar to a constant mild whoosh of air . I bought my wife a set at the same time , and hers still work . Although I believe Audio-Technica is a fine brand name , and I have used other headphones manufactured by them for 15 years at a time , these ATH-ANC7 broke on me , and I can't recommend them . I could not get a refund from Amazon either , as the warranty had expired .  
  After having this unit for two years we are cancelling our Dish service . The DVR would often skip recording events . Then it would stop recording things we had scheduled to record ads that Dish had forced onto the system . It also didn't record complete episodes . I can't tell you how often I missed the last 20 minutes of major shows because the DVR didn't record correctly . Avoid this unit and don't subscribe to Dish-they weren't helpful , they raised rates without informing subscribers , and they tried to force me to not cancel . It took two hours with six different Dish reps to finally get it cancelled . DirecTV is much better .  
  Do yourself a favor and skip this product for following reasons :* Wireless implementation is a joke and not working if you want to add security to your network ( only works when removing encryption which you really do not want to do on your WiFi network ) . I am a network engineer with 10 + years of experience and this frame is the crapiest WiFi implementation I 've ever seen . * Interface is real clunky . * The frame can not auto start and display pictures out of your kodak gallery without the need to go play around with the remote . * Technical support is a frustrating experience : Long wait and they do not know a whole lot either . * A very frustrating experience really .. Too bad I can not give 0 stars on this one .  
  This device has weak power . Good luck if your car has one of the newer style antennas for the car . I was not impressed with the iTrip .  
  Maybe I 'm new to this printer ink game but in my experience I get printer ink cartridges that have the electronic chip on them that allows you to insert them into a print so they start printing immediately . They do say in the title tag here WITHOUT CHIP , but I didn't pick up on it and just wanted to warn any future buyers that in order to get these to work you 'll have to use razor blades and double stick tape to transfer the electronic chip to these ghetto little ink cartridges . Canon doesn't make them and I doubt they 're even legal . What kind of third world company sells ink without an electronic chip . I give it an extra star for me being an idiot and not realizing that WITHOUT CHIP means without the essential printer ink cartridge electronic chip that all ink cartridges should have .  
  Received item . Power on the item doesn't light up . Call DLink tech support found out that the item was defective . Returning item to Amazon . Looking for another one .  
  Anyone who purchases a MR814 will encounter connection problems , but the main pain they will suffer is trying to communicate with the illiterate and unintelligable souls on the phones at Netgear 's tech-support center . And worst of all this company withholds relevant information from it 's customers until you scream load enough from your MR814 inflicted pain . Eventually they disclose that they are fully aware of your issues and have been , but hope to continue selling the MR814 even though it does not perform well in most applications . Warning : only purchase Netgear products where there is a clean and clear return policy that will " net " you your money back when you inevitably go looking for it !  
  All this product does is makes noise like a vacuum cleaner but was a waste of my money , total waste .  
  The one I bought is all packaged ready to go back to the store . It was cheaper than the Linksys , and I had used D-link NIC 's before so I figured I would try it . Boy am I sorry . After 3-4 hours working on this thing I think I 'm in 1986 again . Problem 1 : None of the installation procedures followed the sequence of the printed instructions . I went through a constant questioning process of " where am I now ? " and " what is it trying to say ? " as I tried to translate their instructions said to what I was seeing . This problem was worse as I had to go through the process in part several times . Problem 2 : There seems to be a problem with any install on a Windows XP system . Great . That 's like having gasoline that works in anything but a Chevrolet . This is ultimately what my show-stopper was . Although I found the instructions on the web site and running back and forth between computers , worked my way through them , but , they don't work after you 've done everything else in the instructions - you would have to do them DURING the install , meaning you would have to know that there was an XP problem in the first place . For the folks at D-Link : inability to operate with XP is useful information for a BUYING decision , not an installation . Problem 3 : Tech support . Literature gives a 24x7 number which it is not . I made four calls total and had line suddenly go dead in two of them . Bottom line : I did have the card operating and on the network , but could not ping . I have no doubt tech support could have gotten me going within a few minutes if they were not busy doing the same for every other buyer . I would only buy this card if I were buying in quantity and had the time to figure out how to make the first one work , then could leverage that information .  
  After reading all the reviews and high praise that these headphones received , and also after some extensive research ( being sure not to purchase the counterfeit headphones ) , I decided that these were the headphones for me ( the review stating the proper use of these headphones is what sold me ) . Boy was I wrong ! First off , the rubber that covers the wire feels very cheap and thin . It 's not durable and within a couple of uses , will easily start to wear and tear . Not good for functionality ( especially if you use these headphones for anything from walking to exercise ) . Second , the earbuds are not comfortable at all . I tried the smallest earbud covers as I know my ears are small , and couldn't keep them in for long . It was just irritating ( not at all like my sony earbuds ) . These earbuds felt like they were stretching the inside of my ear . Not at all a comfortable feeling . I did manage to get them in deep enough as to hear the sound and not destroy my ear drum at the same time . As for the sound . I 'm not a connoisseur of music and sound but these headphones add no life to the music . The sound is bland , boring , and flat which makes the music loud and annoying ( I mostly listen to rock , but also a wide range of other genres as well ) . I 've even tried switching the different equalizer 's on my MP3 player and it gets no better . The headphones are advertised as to have bass but if that 's what they call bass , then they are sadly mistaken . The bass is nothing more than a boost in the low tones of the music . The high tones are way too loud and you can't even hear the midtones . These headphones are very overrated and sound just like a cheap pair of iPod-like headphones . These headphones definitely aren't the ones for me as I like my music to sound as if it 's alive and these headphones don't do it . Doesn't mean that these aren't the headphones for you . If you like flat and boring sound , then by all means , these would be perfect for you . Or ( for the objective side ) if you like your music loud , these are perfect because they can definitely get loud . And if you 're wondering if I got a counterfeit pair , well then I guess Amazon is selling counterfeits ( not accusing of course , just sarcastically making a point on authenticity of headphones ) because that 's where I got these from . If you do decide that these are for you , I have a pair that have only been used five times to test sound and would be glad to sell them to anyone who wants because I think , no , I 'm sure I 've just wasted 45.00 dollars .  
  Besides being big and ugly , this antenna did no better than a cheap pair of rabbit ears . I returned it and got the Philips MANT410 which works at my house perfectly .  
  I have bought a copy of this lens for a pentax k-20 and k-7 . It is the worst lens i have in my collection . The international warrenty is completly useless . Do not travel and buy this lens . I have had it for three months and it is a good paper weight . I have tried to get international warrenty on the lens and no one in asia services the lens or does not have the equipment to work on it . The autofocus is so far out it is worthless . Sigma says send it in with camera at my own expense . What a rip off . The IQ is very poor for a lens like this . I suggest buying a paper weight for 5 dollars . And not a 3000 dollar one .  
  I was working on a wireless network that had the MR814 wireless router from Netgear and it was a real mess . The network had two computers on it . The first computer was plugged into the router along with a cable modem . The second computer accessed the network via a Netgear wireless USB hub . The first problem came when the router refused to allow the first PC to access the Internet . After much time I finally got the router to allow the connection and both computers were able to connect to the Internet . Then another problem came up where the second computer , and the first computer could not talk to each other so they could exchange files with one another . No matter what was done the two computers still had problems communicating except when it came to the Internet . I would not recommend this problem as it doesn't seem like a very good one . Two XP machines should not have this much difficulty connecting to each other . Also forget Netgear tech support as you can't understand a word they are saying because they have it based in India now . I had to repeat the router info 3 or 4 times to them even though I went as slow as a turtle reading the numbers . If you find something better than Netgear then grab it . I can't possibly think of a worse product out there .  
  .. i 'm not sure about the clicking noises , but HD has annoying hum . it 's so annoying that i 'm seriously thinking about spending money on another HD . not that i need more space , but i need more silence . i 've had this HD for a week . hopefully it doesn't die before i get another HD .  
  I was looking forward to this product because I have no other way to hook up my phone / mp3 player to my car head unit ( other than a $ 100 chip that you install into the back of the head unit ! ) . I 'm quite disappointed in the sound quality . I 've only tried it in and around Pittsburgh . Have gone through all available stations including the international ones such as 87.7 and 87.9 , but the sound quality is not acceptable . It is actually better just to play the music through the speaker of my phone . At least it was cheap and didn't set me back too much , or I would be returning it .  
  This FM device wooks very poorly in metro areas . I mean poorly . Maybe out in the country towns with only a couple of transmitting stations it would work as advertised . don ; t waste $ otherwise  
  Got the palm and tried to charge it . Would never charge past 50 % capacity . Was unable to tap on battery icon to see what % I was at . Ran larger programs slowly . Probably good for basic stuff , can't run big things - maybe I just got a dysfunctional unit - returned it .  
  No way to trouble shoot - no way to see inside the device . After the 100 + dollars spent , you 'd think you wouldn't just have to throw it away . What a waste .  
  I purchased the Brother MFC-440cn with high hopes after reading several positive reviews . Unfortunately , I have been extremely disappointed with the purchase . The print quality is only mediocre , even on the " best " settings . The paper handling is awkward and inefficient . The default print settings are nearly impossible to locate and change . Most disappointing of all is the fact that the printer makes it nearly impossible to duplex print . It provides no support or assistance for manual duplexing and because the tray is awkward and hard to get to , it is more trouble than it is worth . I tried to write Brother to get help with some of the problems I have had with the printer only to discover that the customer service is atrocious : rude , impersonal , and unhelpful . The printer isn't all bad : The networking is easy to set up and generally works well . There 's a lot of features for what you pay ; it 's just too bad those features are so poorly executed . Don't make the same mistake I did . I was seduced by thinking I was getting a great value because of the wide feature set and low price . Unfortunately , the negatives far outweigh the positives , and this product is definitely not a " great value . " I miss my super-cheap 5-year-old Canon printer . It was light years ahead of this machine .  
  this is a nice little unit but very difficult to use .. one small mistake and the whole thing is a disaster .. good luck .  
  I could never make it work . Lost my money . Low quality .. You better look for other options .  
  I purchased the Sangean WR-1 radio for it 's AM feature . I enjoy listening to Talk Radio . I am well pleased with the radio 's total performance . The WR-1 has a great sound for it 's size . I would recommend the addition of an exterior AM antenna for distant radio stations .  
  I recieved this camera several months ago as a gift . I had never considered using a Kodak camera before as we were very happy with our Canon and had planned on purchasing a better model Canon Powershot . Well much to my surprise this camera is better than I could have imagined ! The macros I can get with this camera blow me away . The SLR like grip and style are VERY nice . The 10x optical zoom is amazing . I cannot be more thrilled with this camera . My only complaint is , it does have some difficulty in low light indoor situations . This can be corrected for the most part through image manipulation software however . Outside shots are utterly amazing however . This camera is a keeper . It is super afforable too . I highly recommend it for anyone , beginner to enthusiast !  
  Bought this to add iPOD playbak to my 2003 Tahoe and it worked for a minute or two then the headunit ejected the adapter . Now I can't get it to stay in and play for more than a couple seconds . When it did play the sound was inferior to even a casette tape .  
  I bought an air card fro this seller , and it was broken . I wasn't able to use it , and the person who sold it to me never responded . Very pissed I was . With electronics , you have better chances spending a little more at FRY 's electonics or the like , than on Amazon . Too much hassel that what it 's worth .  
  I was looking for a UV filter to protect the front element of my brand new expensive macro lens , so I wanted one that was top quality . Doing research , it always came back to B + W being the top of the line , so I decided I would spend a bit more to ensure quality . In the past I have only used Hoya multi-coated filters with satisfactory results . On those , my personal testing showed any image degradation was essentially nonexistent , but just noticeable under heavy scrutiny . Pulling this B + W filter out of the package , I almost worried for a second that the glass had fallen out of the frame . The glass was that significantly clear . Under normal room lighting conditions , I couldn't see any reflections off the filter unless I caught the reflection of a light bulb . I tested my lens with and without the filter , and I wasn't able to find any differences in image quality . The threads sat very nicely , and I have had no issues whatsoever . A good filter ( for protection purposes ) is the one that you don't even know is there , and this one definitely meets that criteria . If you spend a lot of money on a nice lens , I think it is worth it to spend a few more bucks on one of these excellent filters to protect your investment .  
  It works in my Sony DSC-S85 camera , but not in my Sony camcorder . It gives a format error . I 'm not sure why the difference because it works fine in the camera . If I would have known that it would work only in the camera , I would have purchased the Sony Stick .  
  I couldn't believe that I actually decided to purchase these for an upcoming long plane flight for my almost 2yr old daughter . I thought to myself that this will just be a gigantic waste of money because no matter how well they are supposed to fit a toddler there was no way she was going to keep these on and would probably break them inside of 15 mins . WOW was I wrong ! I could not believe what I was seeing . We tried them out at home the day they arrived and she sat and watched an entire movie without taking them off and she actually fought to keep them on all day . I couldn't believe it . The volume limiter is also a great idea since every toddler knows how to operate every single button on all electronics . I also have a 11 month old that when she saw her big sister wearing these of course she had to also and even though they are not designed for a child that small they stayed on pretty well . Of course she could not sit still too long . Bottom line I don't believe you could be disappointed with this purchase . They are inexpensive and they work . Of course on a plane trip with 2 kids even if they work for 10mins your happy .  
  I haven't listened to records since my old turntable broke down years ago . In the meantime , I have a acquired new amp , which does not include a phono option , and the idea of buying a preamp and all the other necessary accessories seemed like too much effort . Well , this compact little turntable does the trick with a minimum of fuss . It 's not an audiophile product , but I must say that , hooked up to my main system , it provides good sound , tracks even scratchy , warped LPs well , and takes up very little shelf space . I even brought it into my kitchen one evening , hooked it up to a table radio , and some 1950s-era jazz records sounded pretty sweet . I 'm going to be getting a few of these to give to my musically-included friends as gifts this holiday season ! For those of you who have forgotten the joy of setting the needle into the groove and hearing that familiar ' swoosh ' - this will bring it all back .  
  not a bad price so I bought 3 .. they will make nice Christmas presents for the kids .. should have waited because I found them cheaper elsewhere . for the same exact thing .  
  I loved this camera . Other than small LCD , I liked everything on it . It would have been better if that battries were Li-Ion . Its pain to carry a separate battery pack or charger ..  
  I recently purchased this card for my Canon FS100 , I only recently purchased the camera itself and this is the first card I have purchased for the camera , but so far it has worked well with my camera and I think this is a great product for the price .  
  Excellent meter . Should be for a professional photographer and not recommended for the person that is not a dedicated 24/7 shooter  
  The iPod gives you a truly portable music collection . It 's very small , about the size of a deck of cards , and fits easily in pockets - even your shirt 's breast pocket . Depending on the model it can store anywhere from 1000 songs ( 5GB ) to 4000 songs ( 20GB ) . The dial / button interface is wonderful . It lets you quickly and easily access the music you 're in the mood for . It can shuffle by song or by album - a feature I 've looked for in CD jukeboxes for years . It uses information from your computer about a song 's relative loudness to ensure that all of your songs from different albums play at a consistent volume . In addition to playing music it can synchronize itself with your address book and calendar . It also includes a version of the Breakout video game . And , I 've dropped mine a few times from a height of 2 to 4 feet onto a variety of surfaces from carpeting to concrete and it still plays and looks fine .  
  Although technically impressive , the DR-MV1 's that I 've had all suffered from VHS tape drive problems-resulting in tapes getting stuck during the loading process . I 've had this happen several times and exchanged the problematic unit for a new one-then it happened again . I 'm on my 3rd unit and the same problem just happened . I 'm going to return it and buy and different brand . I called JVC and they told me that " no problems have been reported with thousands of units sold so far " , but checking the Amazon review shows that this model has several problems .  
  Fits my lens great . It helps protect my glass . Pretty cheap investment to protect your glass .  
  I bought these for my 18 month old so she could watch movies on plane rides , I was afraid they wernt gonna fit right but they fit perfectly and she loves wearing them ! im so happy I purchased this item !  
  The sub has been hooked to my system for about 4 weeks . I am very satisfied with it . Fast shipping .  
  This cable is exactly what we needed and it works perfectly . We use it to hook up our video camera to the TV so we can see what we are taping .  
  Like many reviewers , here and elsewhere , I chose this subwoofer mainly to save on space and to simplify installation - i.e. no separate amp . No car I 've ever owned has had a subwoofer , but now that they 're standard on home theater and PC speaker systems , the absence of bass in the car had become noticeable . I wasn't seeking the other extreme of conspicuous pounding low frequencies , and I wanted to preserve the cargo space in my 1999 Outback wagon unobstructed by a speaker box . The KSC-SW1 certainly meets my needs , filling out the mids and trebles without upstaging them . Even though my Pioneer head unit will control the subwoofer volume and low-pass frequency , I find the wired remote very handy for making quick adjustments based on the kind of music and the driving situation . Some notes on installation , for do-it-yourselfers : I 'd planned to hide this under the driver 's seat of my Subaru , but discovered that it wouldn't fit because of that seat 's two steel cross-members - btw , the KSC-SW1 's dimensions are 15-3/4 " x 3-9/16 " x9 " . Luckily the passenger seat does have enough space underneath - just barely , but this is actually a plus because you do want this thing to stay snugly lodged in place . ( I had to remove a 6-CD changer that I wasn't using anyway because of the mp3 / USB head unit I 'd installed . ) I also tried the velcro approach to anchoring the unit to the carpeting ( using the " xtreme " version ) . Though it wouldn't cling very well , the seat rails hold down the unit vertically and the velcro hooks do keep it from sliding horizontally , the only possible direction it can move while under the seat . The 19-ft wiring harness is much too long for an under-seat installation , but the Outback 's center console has a big enough cavity to stuff all the unused wiring inside . I used the RCA inputs but didn't want to cut the speaker line-in wires . Likewise the excess length of the yellow power and blue continuity wires , the ground wire , and the remote cable are all bundled and tucked away inside the console space , so the harness is intact just in case the next car I put this in requires a longer run . Like many aftermarket head units , my Pioneer has a blue " system remote " wire to turn the unit on and off with the ignition ( a power antenna lead also works ) , but I had wondered about tapping into the yellow power wire directly from the HU ( as the Kenwood instructions appear to want you to do ) . It made more sense finally to run the subwoofer 's heavier-gauge power line directly to the battery , with the black ground wire attached to one of the seat 's floor bolts . To get the wire to the battery , look for a diamond-shaped silicone grommet in the firewall just above the gas pedal . You can poke a little hole through that and pull the yellow wire through to the battery - it 's plenty long ! Good metal-to-metal contact for the ground wire is also absolutely essential for the internal amplifier to work .  
  It works as expected . I installed this black on white tape on a Brother P-Touch Model PT-80 . The PT-80 labeler is not available anymore , so I was happy to see that the tape is still available . I am very happy .  
  Before ordering , I read other reviews of this product which stated that the switching was occasionally sensitive to seizure if components being switched were powered on . I have not experienced this issue . During setup , I did experience slight connectivity issue with unit recognizing connected inputs , but not since . This unit works great for me and has solved my component switching problems . Note : the light emitted from this unit is very bright and might not work well in bedrooms where light can affect environment . Overall I recommend .  
  It 's cheap and the cheapness shows . I was quite disapoointed with the quality of the ink . Will not buy it again .  
  Will this card run The Elder Scrolls 4 : Oblivion ?  
  i have use it for about 1 month . I just want to say that it 's a good GPS , but only one thing inconvenient is the screen 's a little small . If you try to look at it , you may lose control . The ship is fast , and Fedex doesn't work on Monday , so if you order on weekend , your order 'll come on Tuesday . They also require your signature .  
  With only a few caveats , I like these earphones very much . I listen mostly to classical music , and it sounds more clear and natural with these earphones than with any others I own ( Sony and Sennheiser ) . I tried my sister-in-law 's Bose noise cancelling headphones and liked them , but I think I like these much more . They block out sound better than the Bose headphones did , and the bass is more natural . I like that these are smaller - they 're much more portable . These earphones are ideal for orchestral and vocal music . I hear every instrument , every note . I also hear every defect in my source material and am now in the process of re-recording music to my iPod with less compression . I don't like them quite as much for organ music . The bass is beautiful , but it lacks the visceral element of the bass produced by my regular sound system . I studied organ at UT on a large pipe organ , and I liked the way deep bass passages made my rib cage resonate . No headphones can reproduce that effect . There are a few things I don't like about these earphones . I 'm getting used to having them in my ear canals , but I still find the sensation a little unpleasant . I have to make chewing and yawning motions when I insert them to get my ear canals lined up properly to accept them . But this is getting better , and I think that it will soon cease to be an issue . I agree with reviewers who can't easily tell which phone is left and which is right , but as it happens , I don't really mind switching left and right . If I did , I 'd probably mark one phone with a dot of nail polish . I think the list price is excessive , but the Amazon price was quite reasonable for the product . I don't understand the reviewer who said that the Etymotic earphones stick out of his ears - mine are much less noticeable than the earbuds that came with my iPod and they rest pretty flat against my ear . My overall experience with these is quite positive . I 'm liking them more every day . They really do block out sound , so not only should you not wear them when driving or biking or running , you also shouldn't wear them when your spouse is around . I caught mine looking at me rather crossly the first night I got them ( they very nicely blocked out the sound of misbehaving children and my wife 's attempts to make them settle down ) , and I resolved not to use them at home unless everyone else is in bed .  
  I almost went with the competing ' iKlear ' product but after reading reviews here , I decided on this product and I have not been disappointed . Works well on my MBP screen and cheaper IBM work laptop . Great value getting two bottles of this for the price .  
  As for the few people who have had problems , I had the same problems with it cutting in and out , but later figured out it was because I had plugged my subwoofer into the reciever ( so when I turned the reciever of , the woofer would turn off too ) , and whenever the subwoofer required a lot of power the reciever wouldn't have enough for itself and the woofer and would cut out for a second . I 'd assume this would be the case for anyone that uses this power port for other equipment that uses a lot of power . Other than that ( if you consider that a problem ) , I have never had any problems with this product . I absolutely love it , and when bought with the " Sony SA-VE367T 7.1-Channel Surround Speaker System " you 'll be blown away . There are only a few products that currently support 7.1 surround sound , but when you get one that does , you 'll be amazed . Even if you are just using 5.1 surround sound products , you 'll feel like you are there ( playing war games with this is so real that you might need diapers ) .  
  didn't fit the antenna lead from a 1993 BMW 325ISMetra 40-EU10 VW / BMW / Euro Car to Male Motorola Vehicle Antenna Adapter  
  Not good for running . It moves constantly in your ear . I wish it was a bit more snug . I guess you get what you pay for .  
  The light is bright and Very easy to use , Just plug and play , but its so top heavy that it wont stay up at all unless you have it hang over the laptop screen . However If you have your laptop in your vehicle like I do , It don't stay still period even if it 's supported by the screen . So I 'm not to happy with it .  
  I purchased this item to go with my Nikkor 50mm f / 1.8It works exactly as it should . I haven't used it much , but i mainly bought it to protect the lens .  
  Excellent product ! Since buying this one for myself , I 've helped a couple of other friends purchase and then setup their own wireless networks at home and business . WOW ! In every case , it took less than 5 minutes from the point of picking up the package , through unpacking it , positioning it , booting the computer and getting online ! ( This IS based on having read the instructions first , but they weren't needed really . Just plug it in and reboot ! ) Setting up the shared drives and printers , if so desired , was also easy enough for anyone that can read and follow the instructions provided . The one recommendation I 'd like to offer for Linksys would be a power swith of some sorts to easily disable the wireless component . My main desktop is wired via ethernet cable while I have others setup wirelessly . I 'd like to be able to simply push a button to turn off the wireless component when I know I or noboby else will be using it . I have WEP enabled , but I 'd just rather not broadcast the signal when I 'm not using it . Call me paranoid perhaps , but it 'd be a small concession that I 'd gladly pay the extra buck it 'd cost Linksys . Regardless , it 's still and excellent product !  
  I was in the market for headphones to serve my music needs in an open-plan office environment . My requirements were 1 ) quality sound , 2 ) comfort , 3 ) minimal sound leakage . This set basically fits the bill perfectly . I wear headphones almost every day to block out the office noise ( I 'm a developer ) . They are comfortable on my head for up to 4 hours straight ( the longest I 've gone ) , the sound quality is excellent , and finally my coworkers aren't complaining about my music bleeding out . I highly recommend !  
  Yes , it 's nice to have a 28 mm lens on an auto-everything camera , but other than that , I don't really understand what the big deal ( the raves of other reviewers ) is with this camera . The pictures are not any sharper than with my Olympus Stylus Zoom , the exposures are not that great under many conditions , it is very difficult - if not impossible - to stop the zoom where you want to in the middle of its range , and - worst of all for me - the camera comes pre-set with a printable ( wrong ) date , that unless you reset or erase it will ruin all of your photos ! I stupidly took this camera on vacation without testing it first and shot eleven rolls of film with it . I sure wish I had taken my Olympus instead .  
  I 've been using the nuvi360 for about 8 months now , and while it 's been a lifesaver , it hasn't done anything that any other GPS could do . My biggest problem is that the screen is polarized 90 degrees off axis . If you 're using polarized glasses the screen is black . I 've driven about 3500 miles this summer and had to use the thing at a goofy 45 degree angle and tip my head just so I could see the screen . The only reason I didn't return it is because it was a gift . This is a major engineering blunder in the screen fabrication . There are tons of alternatives out there . Get one of those instead .  
  Get this - plug it into your iPod , then into your stereo ; and then .. ask yourself why you didn't get this sooner ! There are NO down sides to this great adaptor , none . Great price , fast shipping . :-)  
  I SOMETIMES USE MY BLU RAY PLAYER OUTSIDE WITH MY PROJECTOR , AND NEEDED AN EXTRA POWER CORD SO I DON'T HAVE TO FISH IT IN AND OUT OF MY ENTERTAINMENT CENTER . KIND OF LIGHT DUTY BUT FITS MY NEEDS ..  
  I thought the price was insanely good , would have been nice to know the Shipping & Handling was just as much . I plugged the car charger into my iPhone 3GS and the device said it couldn't use this accessory .. NOW if I want to return the item I don't get my S & H back and there is an excessive restocking fee of 30 % +  
  I bought this on sale at Staples for $ 99 . It was a disaster . I have always bought HP printers because they have been so reliable and well designed . This unit seems to be the exception . It smears ink all over the page on printouts , even after multiple cleanings . Sometimes a 20 page print job takes 20 minutes , someimtes five minutes . I don't know if I just got a lemon or if HP tried to pack too much into a small unit and all the units are prone to defective output . On the plus side , I bought it for the scanner and the scanner semmed to work really well .  
  great camera , has a connection for an exterior flash .. in my business I use this little gadget in lieu of a polaroid back .. save a lot of time and money .. helps me check lighting in matter of seconds .. matches the prowess of the nikon coolpix , for half the price .. to the reviewer that alleges his photos come out darker than the lcd image .. add an extra flash ( activated by another flash with a slave attachment ) after all photography is light and if you do not have enough light your photos are going to come out dark .. the more light the better your photos .. when using the digital zoom , a tripod is necessary for sharp photos .. image stabilizer will render this camera with a prohibitive prize , after all what do you expect for 400 dollars ..  
  muy buenos discos apropiados para las grabadoras de cd lo unico es que los dos lados es igual y aveces cuesta identificar el lado donde graba  
  I bought this to take to Las Vegas , as most of the hotels there don't have coffee pots in the room . It was slightly heavier than I thought it would be , but it traveled very well . It is actually smaller than the 4 cup drip coffee pots . I just wrapped it in some bubble wrap , and put it in the bottom section of my travel tote . It made good coffee , and very hot . Do be prepared to have it throw off airport security . My tote was searched at both airports . I would recommend purchasing the " recommended " filters which do a good job of making sure there are no grounds in your coffee .  
  I purchased the Flip Video after reading about it in a local paper . It has been great fun taking video of life events we never would have captured if we had to carry our bigger camera . It is so small and light weight , it is easily carried in my purse . The video quality is remarkable , even in dimly-lit situations . The zoom takes some practice . Very good sound quality . I had no trouble downloading the clips to my Mac . The 60 minute version allows more video time away from a computer for down-loading .  
  This is my first Tiffen filter . I received it free as part of an Amazon promotion and I keep it on my Nikkor 55-200 lens . From the test shots I have taken with the filter on and off , I can see no change in my images or reduction in image quality with this filter , and that is what a UV protection filter should do . Also , it is extremely easy to clean , much more so than my multi-coated Hoya UV filter . Construction quality is excellent and I am quite pleased with this filter . If I were to purchase additional filters , I would definitely buy another Tiffen filter .  
  I have been extremely disappointed with this battery . I have used this battery for less than a year and it no longer holds a charge . It was a total waste of money .  
  I have been using my Dymo label maker for several months now and this tape just can't be beat ! The printing is great and the backing peels off very easily .  
  The Casio Exilim EXZ55 competes head to head with the Canon SD400 and SD450 . Likes : The Casio zoom control is in a more convenient place than the Canon . It is right where my thumb wants it to be . The Canon zoom is on a ring around the shutter button and I feel like I 'm going to drop the camera when I zoom out . The Casio battery life is almost three times as long as the Canon . So long that you should not worry if you forgot your spare battery . The Casio battery can be charged inside the camera using the docking station ( the Canon battery must be removed from the camera to charge ) . The docking station is also a little more convenient than Canon 's loose cable if you want to use USB to upload pictures . Dislikes : I think the Canon does a little better job in low light situations with no flash . The Casio images look a little " blocky " on close inspection . However , with flash , the Casio does a better job . The Casio has very even lighting ( I think it has digital compensation to reduce dark corners .  
  I like this computer because it looks cool and its the best yoy can get for that price , plus its modems are super .  
  Installed the adapter in my older HP desktop in order to move it to my daughter 's room instead of running 60 plus feet of cable . The adapter was easy to install , fit perfectly and works just as advertised .  
  I am very particular about my music quality and I thought that buying thes sony headphones might be ok and possibly the only ones that stay in my ears . How wrong I was . They are uncomfortable and the quality of sound is apalling . Don't buy them .  
  This product is cheap / very affortabe . This is the pros . This is a positive credit for the seller . The seller shipped the product promptly . Another positive . But it is designed wrong on the angle interface - the cable will facing the OUT of the computer case for most of the hard drive mount so that the computers can not close the cover . The angle pins should be reversed so that it points inward toward the computer , not block the case cover . I swapped it with the DVD ROM cable which is internal .  
  I got this unit over 6 weeks now . Overall , I like the features ( divx , dual screen in / out , price ) but I 'm disappointed with the picture quality , it 's not as clear and sharp as I wanted , that 's why the 4 stars . I have not test the SD / MMC / USB feature for input of pics . Several reasons for buying this unit : 1 . Play DivxI test it and it does play quite some divx , even QPEL which Philips doesn't , but some QPEL doesn't render well . Also no MKV or OGM , that 's expected . Overall , I 'm satisfied with this feature . I watch anime divx and I can still read the subtitle overall , so I 'm ok with it . Again , don't expect sharp quality when it 's divx . When it 's just MPEG2 DVD , it 's not bad quality . 2 . Dual ScreenIt came w / Dual screens , one screen is with a DVD player and only does output AV . One screen is just a screen , but only takes input AV . Both screen has its own AC adapter and headphone jack . I guess it 's good for car ride , in fact , it comes w / straps to bound to the back of the car seat . 3 . Input / Output AVI needed input AV from my PS2 , so I can play it on the screen when my wife uses the TV . I 'm not as interested in the output since I have a DVD player for TV already . 4 . PriceFor $ 200 , it 's not a bad price for the features , it would really be a steal if wasn't for the ok pic quality . But normal 7 " portable DVD player will run about $ 150 + , so for $ 200 dual screen and with divx play back , it 's pretty good . Overall , I 'm really just using it as a personal player , if there 's portable DVD player that plays Divx , sharp image , take AV input and about the same price , I 'll be selling this unit . I don't really need the dual screen , it 's nice for the car ride , but I don't do car ride that often . Hee hee .. now you know I 'm a Otaku .  
  They are good quality , not great . They perform well , they are priced right . I don't know what else to say other than yes I would buy them again .  
  I purchased this item through Amazon and received it from an Amazon vendor the next day . That is the only thing I can say positive about the product . I am not sure if it is old and has been laying around for years or not , but since I have an older model laser printer HP 5P , these cartridges are not easily found at good prices anywhere . My old cartridge was running out of toner ink and my copies were getting lighter . This new cartridge is great for dark black tones , but there are 4 stripes that run across the page . I tried cleaning the cartridge and cleaning my printer , but to no avail . Since I use this all the time for my work , I am very unhappy with this product . I think that Amazon should make sure that their vendors are not selling old and / or defective products . When I print an envelope , there are 4 black stripes across the front and it looks terrible . Since I threw out the box and the purchase details , I did not know where to send it for replacement ! I hope other people do not have this same problem .  
  I purchased this camera after reviewing the specs and was told there was a mid-roll rewind option . After recieving the camera the manual stated the roll of film can not be reuse once you rewind it . All the cameras I purchased in the past have this feature , but to me if a camera has a mid roll rewind feature the film should be able to be used again . Also it seems that you have to tell the developer to put the date the photo was taken or they put the date it was developed on all them . But it does take nice pictures .  
  I have been very happy with this headset . It is lightweight , comfortable , and sounds great . Excellent value for the price .  
  Encountered some serious ghosting issues with the UV filter when taking pictures that included a light source . Honestly I was taken back by the reviews here and should have known that a $ 6 piece of glass would perform sub-optimally . I immediately took this off my 50mm lens . Would I recommend this ? Not in am million years . At $ 6 I won't be returning it , the hassle of shipping for $ 6 just isn't worth it .  
  I agree with all of the previous reviewers . One of my niggles is that it only comes with a single HDMI input . The remote is pretty much destined for the pile of other unused remotes . I hate that the volume control meter doesn't show when you adjust the volume by default . To enable this means that you also have to see for like 5 minutes the video input ( TV , HDMI , VIDEO1 , VIDEO2 , .. ) selection in the upper right hand corner . Very small issues really . The big thing is this - both Target and Sears have this TV available for as low as $ 800 . Makes me wonder if there is something wrong with this TV . But I 've had it for almost a month now with no regrets . An Update , 8 Months Later = Still works great , no issues with this tv at all . I agree that the tv response speed when using the remote could be better , but I 'm trying REALLY hard to think of something negative about this TV . TBSHD was just added in our area and the MLB Playoff coverage looks fantastic on this TV .  
  I received my 955 3 days ahead of the estimated delivery date .. way to go Amazon ! Some people say the unit is heavy .. I prefer to call it " solid . " It 's bigger and heavier than my 6-yr old unit , but hey , not all electronics are miniturized and this unit has a lot of features . No problem mounting to windshield or with the unit not sitting snug .. no unwanted vibration or noise . I know the unit works .. it picks up traffic speed signs more than a mile away , and I dodged one speed trap already . I especially like the feature where the unit " announces " the type of radar so I don't have to take my eyes off the road . Brightness settings are good and sound volume is okay out of the box ( adjustable ) if you are not listening to the radio / CD at 105 decibles . So far , it 's been a great unit .  
  When I purchased this product , I though that I had the right one , however , I did not . The gentleman gave me a quick rma , and refunded my purchase price . I would buy from them again .  
  I think the product name is pretty applicable . Simple ( Tech ) is right ! Just plug in the cf card and plug into a PC card slot and it works . No drivers necessary ( under XP ) . Very inexpensive , too !  
  It looks good in the box but if you like to hit the snooze feature beware . Timex put the snooze bar and alarm off / on right next to each other on top of clock . Ive overslept for a week before I finally trashed this thing .  
  I bought this router over 5 years ago when it first came out , and it served my needs just fine the whole time . I live in a 3000 square foot single story L-shaped home . The router was positioned at the vertex of the L and was barely able to cover the furthest rooms in the house . I finally decided to replace it this year with a higher performance model ( D-Link DIR-655 ) supporting the new wireless standards ( 802.11g and 802.11n ) . The Linksys router worked fine for supporting my wireless needs for web browsing and it even did a pretty good job wirelessly streaming music around the house . It was a little slow with streaming photos though and definitely wasn't fast enough to stream DVD quality video reliably . When we needed to perform large ( hundreds of megabytes ) file transfers between computers , we usually ended up plugging in an ethernet cable , because the wireless file transfers were too slow . In general , for an 80211b router , this router did a fine job , lasted a long time , and was easy to setup . I can't comment about the Linksys support , because I never needed any support . I 'm deducting 1 star however , simply because in this day and age , nobody should be buying a Wireless-B router anymore . I suggest that you invest a few more bucks ( if that much ) to get at least a Wireless-G router with the same features . If you have devices that support Wireless-N and you can afford a hundred bucks for a router , then I suggest the D-Link DIR-655 .  
  Based on research I purchased this item with the main intent to protect my lens on my D7000 . Also didn't want to reduce image quality with cheap glass . Construction is high quality . Would buy from this manufacturer again .  
  I purchased this kit so that I could watch programs stored on my DVR on any TV in the house . It has worked extremely well . You 'll have to install coaxial cable that runs from each TV to this device . That could be a little expensive if you pay to have it done but if you go the D-I-Y route it 's fairly reasonable . You 're limited to standard definition for your video input but I don't have HD channels so that wasn't an issue . The IR receivers for your remote control work but are susceptible to interference . Moving the IR receivers 1 foot from the TV solved the problem . The interference only effects the remote control operation and not the TV reception . There isn't much of a description of this unit on Amazon but Channel Plus 's web site has some helpful info . The kit has 2 AV inputs for something like your DVR or DVD player . You can assign a different unused channel for each input . My DVR is 36 and the DVD is 38 so if I want to watch my DVR I 'll tune my TV to 36 . You can also connect your cable TV or over the air antenna to the unit so all your TVs can receive those channels too . If you receive NBC over channel 3 you just tune any of your TVs to 3 to watch . You can watch different inputs on each of your TV 's . I can watch the DVR on 36 in the kitchen , the DVD on 38 in the living room and NBC on 3 in the bedroom at the same time . I used the 5557BID to replace a wireless setup . This unit works much better . It took me a day to install coaxial cable but it was well worth it . The standard definition picture is clear and the sound is crisp . If you have all your shows being recorded to a DVR like Mythtv , Windows Media Center or Tivo and want to be able to watch them on all your TV 's you should consider this system .  
  I recently bought this camera and was very excited about the hype . This camera looks great , very " quality " feeling , I also find it has the ability to take great pictures , you just have to experiment with the settings . My only gripe about the camera is that the sound quality is SO bad . My 4 year old camera sounds clearer ! If you don't care about the sound quality then I would recommend this camera for you . Overall , it 's good enough .  
  I was looking for a quiet keyboard that wouldn't wake up my toddler like my stock Dell keyboard did , and one that lit up so I could type in the dark . This one fit the bill perfectly . I 've had it for 2 months and no problems . It 's already put up with some abuse from my toddler without a scratch . The keys aren't as quiet as I had hoped , but I don't really see how they could get any quieter unless you made them out of a softer material . Others complained about having to change the light color after restart , but it 's so easy to do by pushing one button it 's not worth mentioning in my opinion . I love and recommend this keyboard !  
  Cables arrived ahead of schedule . Cables worked great .. quality cable and connectors . I ordered other cables from C2G and all worked well . I even ordered wrong cables ( my mistake ) and they sent me what I should have ordered in quick return . These cables and C2G are nice to work with  
  I bought this flash-drive for $ 17 ( w / o shipping ) and I am very happy I did so .. because Sony MicroVault has this inbuilt software that compresses many file formats so that it can store more than 2gb . Very fast , and looks cool , and above all , it is a SONY !  
  The glass cutter works as it should , although I have a problem with one corner of the glass not always being squared . It may just be that , by the time I get the cutter pulled back in close to me , it 's not getting the same downward pressure . It 's handy , though , for cutting glass for picture frames .  
  This is a great product and we have had NO issues with it .. does not distort or color pictures . A Great product .  
  Here 's my story . I used to have ( note past tense ) pretty much all Linksys gear in my home . Router , switches , print servers , etc . Over a half-dozen devices because our condo is wired like an office with network drops everywhere . All of a sudden in the span of about 6 months , one-by-one most of the devices just died . They had power , but simply would not pass network traffic . I wrote to Linksys and basically said , " Here 's my situation , meet me half-way , do something , anything to keep my business . " They never replied . So I began a quest to look into a new switch for my home office . I decided I wanted a 16 port model because I might max out an 8 port unit . I noticed that the " ProSafe " line from Netgear comes with a lifetime warranty and 24/7 technical support ( although how much support can one need for an auto-sensing switch , assuming it 's actually working . ) So I gravitated toward that line of products . Then looking at the comparison charts I was trying to determine the difference between the mid-level " GS " series and their top of the line " JGS " series switches . There is only one : The JGS models have a built-in power supply . Meaning , no " brick , " just a standard 3-prong power cord . Sold ! My only complaint ( and it is significant ) : The little fan inside this monster is quite noisy . Almost as loud a standard desktop PC , which uses a much larger power supply and fan . Mind you it does not sound " cheap . " It sounds like a quality fan and power supply . It quite simply needs a little better ventilation and Netgear needs to invest that whopping extra 2 bucks on a higher grade fan that it is truly whisper quiet . So in summary , fine for a network closet or an open area with a few people an other things that make modest constant noise , but think about it a bit if it will be in a " quiet " office setting . With quieter operation , it would easily earn 5 stars in my book .  
  TDK manufactures excellent 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording . As long as you have the right kind of equipment , these tapes record the sounds of record albums , radio shows , CD-Rs , people talking and more . These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side . The features of this tape make it good for recording lectures and music using standard , less expensive home stereo equipment . The tape playback sound will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car . In addition , the tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times ; and they take up very little room so they 're easy to carry around with you . Unfortunately , these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you . This means that if , hypothetically , you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a TDK cassette tape , the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a TDK cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you . TDK does manufacture higher quality cassette tapes including the SA ; and these are very good tapes for recording music . Nevertheless , they still aren't the same as a digitized recording on CD-R or CD-RW . Moreover , cassette tapes can break if not handled with care . They can also break if used a few too many times , too . Therefore , I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup . These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review . The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible . If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole . The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording . Overall , TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music , the radio , people talking or anything you wish to record . I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints . I highly recommend TDK normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape  
  This is the second set of these speakers I have purchased . These ones are going to be a gift . I 've searched around for travel speakers and these guys are the best buy around : for under $ 20 you get 10 watts of power , adjustable bass and treble that actually works , and a very decent amount of sound . If you 're looking for speakers that stay at home , the JBL Creatures are another good buy at about $ 83 .  
  I grew tired of the usual drip coffee maker and this percolator makes me fall in love with coffee again . Pros : - Coffee has more body and depth . - Great for making a 3-cup afternoon pick-me-up . - Compact , doesn't take a lot of space on the counter . Cons : - Cleaning takes a bit more time-Coffee grind at the end of brewing cycle . Have to pour gently and leave a little coffee in the pot to avoid the grind . - Available reusable nylon filters do not fit the 6-cup percolator ( too big ) . Had to return one and do not want to use paper filter either ( no more paper in my coffee ) .  
  Installation under Windows XP on my Athlon XP notebook PC was a piece of cake . Remember , under XP you don't install the drivers using the utility that came w / the card . Instead , you plug in the PCMCIA card and XP will recognize it and request the location of the drivers . You can then put your Linksys CD in and browse for the driver . That is all there is to it . For card configuration , you use the wireless configuration tool in XP , not the Linksys app . Make sure you set up WEP , otherwise your network belongs to anyone w / in range . Range for any wireless card is not great . I live in an old house with thick , plaster walls - I get somewhere around 30 ft of range through multiple walls . I don't know anyone who gets the claimed 100 ft of WiFi range , or even half of that inside of a house . Still , no reason not to set up WEP . That is done through XPs wireless configuration utility as well . The card has 2 LEDs - one indicates it has power , the other a sync . But I have lost the signal completely and both LEDs still glowed . There is a firmware upgrade , which I have not applied . I am thinking I might leave well enough alone . It works . Don't expect wired performance . Wireless is great for internet connection sharing , but for file sharing I still prefer wires , for both speed and security .  
  I previously had iPod earbuds and I was really annoyed by them . The sound quality was sub par and they always friggin ' came out . However , these have a great sound quality for their price and they don't continually fall out . If you 're looking to upgrade without dropping $ 100 .. this is your buy .  
  I thought I 'd be smart and buy less expensive cartridges for my HP Color LaserJet . I thought that rather than buy a no-name , off-brand I 'd go with Xerox thinking I could trust the quality . I was wrong on all counts . I bought the magenta and the yellow cartridges . The yellow cartridge I purchased is defective , but because I don't use the printer often ( though when I do it 's for very important , big jobs ) I didn't realize the cartridge was not working properly until well after the return window had closed . Without proper yellow saturation , all of my documents , including those that are supposed to be plain black text are purple . Legal contracts in purple . Cute . Almost $ 90 for a defective cartridge . Not cute . PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful . So , please vote ( the " Was this review helpful to you : Yes or No " buttons ) and leave a comment if you 'd like , even if it 's just to say , " Hi ! " I respond to all comments so feel free to ask a question about the product . Also , when you leave a comment , I will go to your reviews and pay you the same courtesy .  
  What can you say about Tri-X ? It 's fast , it 's grainy , and it 's one of only two reversal films produced by Kodak for the Super 8mm format . And now it 's available on Amazon at a not-unreasonable price . Huzzah ! And contrary to what another reviewer claimed , there are many labs that are able to process this film . Google " CineLab " , " Spectra Film and Video " , " Pro8mm " , and " Yale Film and Video " for just a few examples .  
  this product is good for small speakers .. won't push 10 " or 12 " inch speakers ..  
  I work in technical support for small and large format printers . This has been a great tool kit . It is in a nice compact case that I can lock away in my file cabinet . And so far has had all the tools I need to make repairs .  
  I love this player ! I bought it a couple weeks ago - yes , it is not the best with store bought CD 's - but that is not what I bought it for . I put 172 songs on a CD , and I 've been playing it on the Rio constantly , with no problems . I even took a car kit that I had from a previous MP3 player purchase , and used it in a drive to Captiva Island - 3 hours each way , 80 + MPH - not a problem . I even took it over speed bumps - perfect ! I love this player - especially since with the latest firmware , I can use the resume function !  
  Bought this UV filter to protect my Nikon 24-70 f2.8 lens and so far I 'm satisfy with the purchase .  
  I 've had my camera for a little over a week now and LOVE it ! I haven't played w / every single feature but have tested quite a few settings , zooming and such . I only have produced a few blurry shots .. other than that , the shots are crystal clear ! They looked great on the camera as well as when I upload them onto my computer . Also as a side note ( since I 'm a graphic designer ) , I always put the pics I take into photoshop to touch things up and to do auto levels . I barely need to touch the photos . Some needed a little help w / the lighting but I was very impressed ! The video part of the camera works wonderful as well . So far , I 've just taken videos of my puppy doing his tricks . They turn out wonderfully and look awesome playing the videos back on the computer . The only drawback I have seen thus far is not knowing when the battery is going to die .. until right beforehand . That happened to me while I was at my company 's winter party . Since the charger is farily compact .. I will remember to bring it w / me when I goes places ( the battery does last quite awhile ! ) I also bought the SanDisk 1 GB Ultra II Secure Digital Memory Card and it works fabulous ! It holds a multititude of pics as well as video and uploads to my computer easily and quickly . I am using the camera for personal pics as well and taking pics to use for my job . I highly recommend this camera :D  
  Since I could not find link anywhere for the older camera , Nikon Coolpix 4600 I was uncertain when ordering if this would work - and was suspicious of low price . It arrived quickly and it works perfectly . Won't be losing this one I hope .  
  This is my first light meter , so I can't make comparisons to other models , but this L-358 is easy to use and understand provided you have an intermediate knowledge of camera exposure settings and lighting . This model can also support an optional module that will fire strobes / flashes connected to PocketWizards .  
  All these great reviews perplex me .. maybe mine was just the luck of the draw . After just 9 months of occasional use , it just displays " service required " and never alerts me . I 'm a pretty techie person , so I searched websites and read the manual , and tried all the troubleshooting steps mentioned ( i.e. re-programming , mounting the radar detector in a different location , & then re-calibrating after each troubleshooting step , etc . ) . I even used another non-Beltronics radar detector when following my husband 's truck to see if there are literally no radar alerts , and his Whistler alerted us while my V955 remained silent . Beltronics will not repair it under warranty because I can't find the original receipt , EVEN THOUGH I REGISTERED THE WARRANTY WHEN I BOUGHT IT AND THEY HAVE ME LISTED IN THEIR DATABASE . I thought that was the whole point of registering the warranty ? They want $ 100 just to look at it . The warranty statement in the manual says nothing of this . So regardless of the great reviews other shave for this product , what if you are one of the " lucky " ones who get a lemon like me who ends up with a $ 279 paperweight ? Thumbs DOWN . Will never order a Beltronic product again !  
  This is one of those great deals where the looks and interface perform better than the price . My only complaint is that the signal is sometimes weak in my Audi , while in the Dodge truck it 's flawless . I believe it has more to do with the film applied to the thick windshield than the GPS as this problem has occurred with previous units . When the GPS has difficulty finding a signal I simply open the sunroof or window and the problem disappears . Besides that , the interface is one of it 's best features . It 's very intuitive and has large buttons to operate without focussing on it too long . The graphics and maps are very up-to-date .  
  It worked .. I used this flat cable to connect my Dish satellite to the receiver in the basement , through the window .. Be a little careful when you open / close the window . Amazing . ThanhPhan  
  I have been looking for something to replace the unit the kids have been using . We got tired of the fights over which DVD to play so we went looking for separate units that wouldn't empty the wallet . The main features we wanted were : Tablet style ( or flip into one ) , SD or USB card support , DIVX support and IR heaphones . Well , this unit delivered all of it except the IR headphones . When we received the unit I immediately put in an SD card from my phone . The music on it began playing instantly . Good start . Next loaded up some XVID movies I had ripped and they played perfectly . Finally plugged in my Archos 605 ( 80gb ) player and it actually read the directory but took about 2 minutes . I could select a movie to play but it locked up . I had heard there are problems with large USB hard drives so it may be true . Minor problem since I wouldn't give my kids the 605 anyway . The headrest bra works great and the speakers are way better than expected . It does feel cheap like others have noted but it seems to work great . My son will give it the true endurance test . So we ordered another and now have 2 units with separate DVD players , SD cards loaded with movies and music for each child and headphones . That 's it . All for about $ 300 which is a bargain for this much value . If I get 2 years out of each unit I 'll be happy and would probably go buy another one . Now if only we can get rid of the wired headphones . Hope this helps .  
  Worked great - Wish I had bought it sooner . - Be very careful about adding additional memory . The bad new is the Memory stick I bought was slightly off sized so I filed it to fit into the memory slot now the printer is dead and this was a waste of money as I had to buy a new printer .  
  Needed an affordable replacement battery for my old iBook G4 workhorse and I got it . I 'd surely buy again and suggest others take a look at this fine product .  
  I purchased the Hot Link Pro system to hide all of my components in a closet behind the TV . The product was very easy to setup . It took maybe 5 minutes and works with my Sony receiver ( newer model ) , and Directv dvr / hd receiver . The eye for the Hot Link pro is behind the wall mounted tv and isnt even showing . There isnt any delay when I press a button on the remote like I was expecting to have either .  
  This card is the most inexpensive one I could find and it does the job it is supposed to do . I think it is a tad slower ( just my rough observation without any measuring instrument ) but not as much that I would hate this card . Works well , price is right .  
  I think the product is fine . It works OK with most computers I 've tried . However , Windows 98 and 98se do not " understand " USB drives natively . You have to install drivers . I don't blame the manufacturer for that , so the product is still worth 4 stars . As a side-note , you may find this particular hard drive enclosure to be slightly better than some others , because it can be fully USB-powered . So , no need for a power cord ( although one is available , optionally ) .  
  I bought this unit back in April-2009 for the sole purpose of transfering home movies from VHS to DVD before they deteriated , or for that matter , the dreaded tape Break . Just to have someone transfer a home movie over to DVD was running me $ 30 for the first 2 hours . I have 13 to transfer , you do the math . I looked everywhere : walmart , sears , k-mart , target , costco .. either they didn't have what I was looking for , ie : out of stock , or they just do not have it , any more . As I knew that VHS was on it 's way out , and DVD is here to stay , or for at least a minute , I began my serch online . There wasn't much to offer within my budget , I seen this Sony and checked out the reviews . After reading the reviews , I figured on getting a Refurbished / Recertified , thinking maybe I will get lucky with one that got returned by a dissatisfied customer . Got a 3 year warranty from Square Trade , just in case I didn't get lucky , and in the 4 months of owning it , I have been able to transfer most of my home movies over to DVD , with NO problems at all . It helps to read the booklet . The playback is just as good as the original . I have played Copy Protected movies , in both VHS and DVD , and both play fine . I realy like the 2-way touch dubbing from VCR to DVD or for that matter , DVD to VCR ! ( NON COPY WRITTEN MATERIAL ONLY ) So far in the short time of owning it , I have Not been Disappointed . Adding , after reading the reviews , it has performed better than I had expected .  
  The case is perfect in all regards except one . The camera strap really doesn't fit through the opening but this is essentially a non issue as I wouldn't want to constrain the camera so much anyway .  
  I had an old Panasonic PVD-DV51 camcorder and wanted to transfer the images on the tape to computer files and eventually burn them to DVD . Of course I thought it wouldn't work , but low and behold I attached the adapter to my Firewire cable and plugged it into my Windows VISTA computer ( because it had the 4 pin input slot ) and BOOM the Windows application opened on it 's own so I could capture video from the camera . Worked like a charm for my application and for a few bucks it was a lot cheaper than buying a separate piece of hardware to do the job , or taking my old tapes to a video store for conversion . Hope it works for you too . Cables To Go - 27028 - Firewire 6-Pin Female 4-Pin Male Adapter  
  I went with this speaker because it timber-matched with the polk RTI10 's and RTI4 's that I purchased . This added the bass that I was missing even after bi-amping the front speakers . This is not a earth shaking sub , but , is decent and will add the missing bass . No regrets for the money I spent .  
  I am having the same issue as the former reviewer using this drive with an aluminum Powerbook ( Mac ) .. well , not using it is more accurate . I purchased the thing this afternoon because I needed to transfer work to my laptop for tomorrow .. it 's now 2:40 in the morning and I can't get the info off of the drive , so I will be up the rest of the night burning DVDs instead . Ugh . They really need to provide better documentation and note that it is too low powered for ( certain ? ) laptops .  
  This is a super lens , very sharp and clear , excellent for macro work . The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it is not a simple lens to use . It requires a very solid tripod and focusing is done by changing magnification or moving the object or sometimes the camera . At high magnification such movements have to be made very carefully .  
  I think this is a great camera . It takes nice shots and probably even better ones then I have been taking since I have yet to use all of the different modes and features that it comes with . My only real problem with this camera is there isn't a view finder just a screen which is impossible to see if the sunlight hits it . So , you find yourself aiming and shooting and praying you got the shot . Out of direct sun it is great . If they could just add a view finder it would be perfect !  
  I bought this printer ( not free like it is now , but was $ at the time ) for our mother when this first was introduced . We have used it ever since as a means to send her photos or cut-n-paste items from the Internet since she just cannot access a computer without difficulty . At any other time over these years I would have given this solution a 5 star rating . Even though we quickly learned to not use any of the ' free ' ( nothing really is free ) downloads like puzzles etc since they suck the expensive ink cartridges dry , the product still delivered what we were mostly looking for at the time . At $ 99 / yr it seemed worth it . At $ 149 a year it is not . And not only that , people can use a code to get a free printer so all of us who have been customers since the first days not only have a printer we paid a lot of $ for originally that is truly worth NOTHING now , we also have gotten hit with a 50 % service increase . So after all of these years it was decided not to renew the service in early December . Our mother gave the final thumb down to the idea .  
  I love the case and it suits my needs very well . I am a road warrior and I carry a lot of documents and manual etc . The only thing I can say negative is that there is no optional shoulder strap . There are times that you just can't roll it and when that happens if you have the case loaded up it is not really manageable to carry it by the handle . I would definitely buy again and [ .. ] was awesome  
  just the thing to play my old 78s , and its got enough torque to make cleaning the dirty little buggers easy too .  
  Got it this morning .. little tight on the fit with my 190CXPRO3 and a 484RC2 Mini Ball Head with RC2 Rapid Connect Plate attached . Quality is good .. price is a bit high . Funny story though .. this little flat package arrived via Prime .. UPS in a huge box nearly 4 foot tall and about 12x12 and stuffed with about a dump truck load of brown wrapping paper . Geesh ..  
  I got this General Electric cordless sound recorder for Christmas 2003 . This is a great product , It 's got great features , and also I got a six-pack of cassette tapes by Sony . They 're cassettes that I can record for only ninety minutes on both sides A and B on every audio cassette . It costs less than 30 bucks and I like this product . It 's a lean , mean , sound recording machine !  
  Works good . VEry good alternative for those who don't have CD players in their older cars .  
  just got prints back from this camera . they look much nicer than from my old 5mp camera . i have wanted to get a 7 for a while and to get one under $ 200 is great ! i like the way you hold it . very comfortable . i 'm still finding out about all the great stuff it does , but there is a manual to read , and a CD with same info if you want to use that instead , and a guide in the camera to view help . image stabilizer works great ! i bought a double A battery charger to save $ from the start and so far i still haven't needed to replace the batteries and i took about 100 pictures . camera takes 2 double As . just remember to turn it off when not using and you should find comparable battery life like with any other camera .  
  I love the feel and ease of the keys . It 's like typing on air . I really believe my speed and dexterity has improved . And the strain on my wrists are minimal . Although it feels lightweight , it is really quite durable as I have had this keyboard for a while now .  
  Totally worthless . The set screws will not stay in place , using 10 gauge or higher wire , I doubt they 'd even grip 12 gauge . For the record I 'm using this speaker wire : Pyramid RSW12100 12-Gauge 100-Foot Spool of High-Quality Speaker Zip WireThese banana plugs work fine : Sewell Silverback Banana Plugs , Dual Screw Lock , 6 Pair ( 12 Pieces ) Its just a poorly made product .  
  I ordered this speaker because I don't have much room about my TV and my THX center channel is way to large to fit in the space . The speaker does a good job all around .. no complaints .. I guess my only wish was it was 4 ohms not 8 .. but all the new receivers ( at least the higher end ones ) have a microphone you place in the room and it calibrates the speakers .. so my 8ohm center ( this speaker ) gets adjusted so it matches the others .  
  I absolutely love this and recommend it to anyone who needs to share pictures and letters with a loved one who is ' technically challenged ' . We bought this ( and the service ) for our Grandmother who lives far away and who doesn't own a computer ( nor would she be able to operate one ) . This is a really great way for me to quickly send her photos and quick updates on our family . I love sending photos to her from my iPhone now too !  
  Original review 9/11/12 : This item is perfect for my situation . I am a fairly heavy person of average height . The pad fits my back and is the right height . It does smash down about half way when I fully lean against it . But at this point that is OK . In fact , since it has so much give to it , it does not feel like you have a lump in the middle of your back - it feels more natural . And most times I am not pushing against it that hard . If the mesh were to loosen more over time I could put something between it and the chair . So far it is fine the way it is . You can't beat the price , and it shipped the same day I ordered it . Update 11/5/12 : I have been using this support daily for 2 months . It has not collapsed or loosened , and still provides the same level of support . My back no longer aches .  
  Good :* much smaller than I expected . It slides easily into a coat pocket . * great image quality . Even a novice / lazy photographer like me can get amazing pictures ! * easy to use ( see above ) Bad :* battery dies when connected to the computer . Buy a spare . * software program not intuitive . Also - " Olympus Master " ? Creepy . I edit in the camera or using MS Photo Editor or Photoshop . * no viewfinder means sometimes you 're not sure what you 're shooting . It 's more than a mild annoyance , but in balance it 's okay because you 're getting a great camera at a reduced price .  
  I bought this coffee pot to replace my mom 's old one which was still working , but the cord was not fitting securely into the pot any longer so it needed to go . She used the first one for probably over 10 years and used it every day . It makes the best coffee .  
  I purchsed these after purchasing Sony ear phones . My comparison is based upon the Sony versus the Etymotics . The Sony Earphones were on Sale at a local chain for $ 5 from $ 20 . The Etymotics were $ 60 . The Etymotics have excellent sound and good bass . You should only use them with the foam eartips installed . These eartips filter out all background noise and do make them sound a lot better . I was able to listen to music on a plane and hear it clearly with no background interference from either jet engines or annoying idiots sitting next to me that would rather talk than read . I personally like a lot of bass when I listen to music . Mainly , I listen to Classic Rock , heavy metal , Hard rock etc . I use them with my iPhone and have the Equalizer set on Rock . These are better than the Sony earphones when considering the things I mentioned . They are also more comfortable . You can wear them for long periods without your ear bothering you . ( Remember Foam Tips ) Are they worth $ 55 more than the Sony 's ? If you are truly interested in good bass sound and background noise filtering then yes , they are worth the money . If not , go to your local Wallymart and get the Sony earphones . If you value good bass sound from your iPod / iPhone then spend the money for the Etymotic ER6i and also get an extra bag of foam ear tips .  
  Incompatible with some newer blu-ray discs : firmware ' upgrade ' lost sound and visual quality for all dvds , with no way to revert to the earlier firmware . Samsung support is very , very poor on this : they said we 'd have to phone every few weeks until their engineers released a new patch , and we could not watch anything until then . This player is also very slow to load , and hangs from time to time .  
  This review is aimed at an advanced user who will want to use this as a desktop replacement for serious work , or serious gaming for that matter . My decision to purchase this model was largely swayed by the screen . A 17 " widescreen display running at a resolution of 1680 by 1050 is something to behold . This is definitely the best screen I have seen yet , and completely kicks my old 1600 by 1280 CRT monitor . There is just no comparison . Four weeks later , and I still say " wow " each time I power up the beast . The display is well backed up by the Nvidia GeForce FX 5700 card with 128 megs DDR . For pure gaming , I am constantly blown away by Half-Life 2 running at the full 1680 * 1050 at highest quality settings . Gameplay is smooth and the display crisp , however in large and busy scenes one can notice a slight lag in response . For this reason , it would have been nice if they had put in 256 megs on the card , as seems to be the standard these days . Note that this is a desktop-equivalent graphics card , and so all the top PC games should run just fine . The 1 gig of RAM and the 3.2 GHz processor pair up to provide quick and smooth work under Windows XP . Firing up MSOffice or compiling reams of code is appropriately fast , and I am more than happy with the performance of the unit . Before I forget , the Harman Kardon speakers are very impressive . The sound compares very well with a pair of quality bookshelf speakers and is definitely the best stuff that I have heard coming out of a laptop . Of course , they cannot compare with a pair of good hi-fi speakers . All the standard plugs and ports aside , the digital media memory card reader is a welcome addition , as are the four networking possibilities in the built in modem , network , wireless and firewire units . Bluetooth is missing .. a pity , but the unit does provide IrDA , so I can use that to talk to my mobile phone . A disappointment is the DVD + RW drive . You can tear through a hundred websites and manuals but nowhere does it say what speeds this unit operates at . Finally , I queried this directly with HP to be told that for DVD + RW the unit rewrites at 2x speed . This is old technology , and I am a little upset that this unit does not match the level of the rest of the machine , and they disguise this fact as best as possible . A serious user of DVD + RW might therefore have to fork out for a new unit that can handle 8x . The unit is manufactured by Sony , so of course it purposefully does not do DVD-RW and DVD-R , only + R and + RW . There are also no region free patches it seems , so one has to use a software solution to be able to watch films from other parts of the world . The writing software that comes with the unit is meant for amateur users . One really has to purchase Nero to get decent use from this DVD + RW writer . The other BIG disappointment is the TV tuner accessory . It is preset in hardware to match the standard USA channels , NTSC only . So , the instant you leave the US border , you might as well throw the unit away . The increase in cost should they have included a fully tunable NTSC / PAL unit would have been minor , and so this is really inexcusable . This is a laptop , it is meant to travel . There are other TV tuners that provide this functionality that are compatible with WinXP Media Center edition , and I intend to get one soon . Software-wise , the machine comes with loads of marketing garbage preinstalled - lots of trial versions , lots of things asking for money , for upgrades , for serial numbers . The solution to this is of course a complete format , and reinstallation of the OS , drivers , and a few useful applications . Follow this by updating windows online with service pack 2 , and then by downloading available driver updates from the HP site . Then install the free AVG anti-virus program , Nero DVD burning software , MSOffice and you 're pretty much done . As for Linux users , this laptop is a lot " closer " to a desktop machine than other laptops I feel , so one should be able to get Linux up and running with few problems , and maybe even have most of the integrated peripherals working too . I do however have my doubts about Linux support for the integrated memory card reader . You should check this beforehand if it is important to you . In summary , the ADVANTAGES are : - fantastic screen and sound , and a great graphics card - fast machine with loads of memory - has all the necessary plugs and slots and features - HP support , great website with all updates , etcthe DISADVANTAGES are : - a useless TV tuner unless you will ever only be in the USA - old technology DVD + RW writer - heavy with a short battery life ( 2 hours max ) , but then again this is a desktop replacement , don't forget thatSo , a five star rating , less one for the dud TV tuner and slow DVD + RW writer . Overall , I am thrilled with my purchase , and will be even more so when I get an international TV tuner .  
  I bought this camera over three years ago and my partner also bought one . It has proved to be all that was promised . Simple to use , giving great photos and with the option of a 60 sec . movie , it covers every situation . Perhaps it 's greatest factor for me is using floppy disks for memory . Always available , and in an emergency , they can be reused . Just a 3 1/2 floppy drive and no cables - what could be easier . Like many of your other reviewers , I just love this camera and hope it lasts forever !  
  I build and take care of hundreds of computers for a University . I have a degree in Electrical Engineering . I have used many Coolmax @ power supplies . I placed an order for six model CX-400B Coolmax power supplies . Two failed within a couple months , three were DOA . Testing of the units show overvoltage , and lack of voltage control . Many motherboards were tried , the result was rebooting , failure to start and damage to one motherboard ! Warranty at Coolmax says they will replace them , but it shows someone at the company was asleep at the wheel during the production and inspection of this power supply . One star is one too many for this product !  
  I own two of these and they work GREAT . I 've used them with the 30D , 5DmII , and G10 . It works great . At least 19 out of 20 shots are flawlessly exposed . ( That 's better than I 've experienced with Canon OEM flashes . ) Apparently the other person to review this here on Amazon ( only one other review at the time of this writing ) didn't consider that his unit may have been defective . I bought this when I worked at Ritz camera ( Quantaray is their store brand ; I haven't worked there in a long time and I am proud to say I do not represent them in any way ) and I never heard any customer complaints about it . Ted 's 1 star review seems quite ridiculous . The combination of this module and a Quantaray or Promaster ( same thing , just that the Q line are rebadged for sale at Ritz Camera ) produces amazing results at a tiny fraction of the price of a Canon-brand flash .  
  We do not have a stereo system and wanted something that could fill up our living and dining room with music . We looked at other systems and they were either too big , too expensive or did not put out a lot of sound . This system is perfect all around - size , price and sound level . It is great that my wife and I can take either of our ipods and plug them in to play music . We put the system in our dining room and I use the remote in the living room to changes songs , control volume and to start / stop play . We do not use them , but there are many ways to connect audio and video players to the system ( it is not just for ipods ) .  
  The quality of this bag is just great the problem could be the very tiny front bag . It also has a small bag for the AC power cable and transformer but once you use it there is no place to put it comfortably considering a 15 " laptop .  
  NOTE : I bought this in the States , didn't open it until I arrived in Germany , and it has only been used in Europe . I work in Germany and wanted to get a GPS to get around without spending too much on a GPS . Obviously GPS systems with only US maps are cheaper than any dual US / Europe GPS , so I researched different brands and models that were compatible with online map upgrades . I found a great pick with the TomTom One XL . I bought the system when on sale for $ 200 , and I bought the " Western Europe " map upgrade online for $ 120 ( thru TomTom home ) . There is not enough internal memory , so I put the new map on a SD card . I had a few issues after purchase and download of the Europe map , but customer service was great ( no waiting on the phone , and they stayed on with me until the issue was fixed ) . OK , so the new map wasn't as simple as " plug-n-play , " but after 30 minutes on the phone with U.S. customer service troubleshooting my problem , I ran a flash file on my XL , I turned on the system , and after 45 seconds of searching for sattelites , the GPS was tracking my location in Germany . The interface is adequate , with large buttons on the 4.3 " screen that make it easy to choose . The tracking of my location has pin-point accuracy , and when I turn on the system , it takes less than 60 seconds to locate my position . My mount is solid , and I have excellent reception without any tacky antennas . POIs are slacking , but I 'm just trying to get from point A to point B. I 'm a basic user . Overall , I 'm very pleased with this US / Canada / W Europe GPS for only $ 320 total . It has been a great convenience getting around city and rural Europe , especially since road signs and names can be confusing here .  
  Best 6x9 's EEVVEERR ! I have about 90 ( real RMS ) watts in each ( of 4 ) from a clean amp ( don't get a whimpy amp for these - it 'll be a waste - . 01 to . 07 THD and 100 to 105 SNR will do nicely ) and can't even imagine enduring much more ( though I do believe they could handle the 250 each with ease [ 200 to be safe , though ] ) - Can't hear my engine or even traffic with the windows OPEN ! Apparently quite efficient - VERY clean and tight . Instruments don't sound jumbled together and sound as they should . Sweet bass for 6x9 's , but you 'll still need a sub if you want to rattle your licence plate and set off alarms . QUALITY - the extremely low price is just another plus !  
  I purchased these head phones for my 2 year old and he loves them ! He is pretty rough with them and takes them on and off frequently but they have held up just fine ! I woudl definetely recomend these to anyone .  
  A week after purchasing this keyboard ( Saitek Eclipse II ) , the N key would randomly stop working . I popped off the key and found that the gel pad underneath the keys wasn't aligned correctly . I was able to stuff something under the bottom of the N key to get it to strike the pin correctly . Problem solved . Another week or so later , the shift keys would intermittently act as if they were being held down . This wasn't a big deal though as it didn't happen that often . A few days later I noticed that the entire number pad would stop responding for a few minutes at a time . Then the arrow keys randomly started going by themselves . Then I started losing LEDs . After that more keys stopped functioning like the N key did originally . After I had had the keyboard for about six weeks , I e-mailed the manufacturer . After waiting two weeks for a response , I sent them another e-mail . Waited another week . Sent another e-mail . No response . I tried calling but could never get through , their phone line just kept referring me back to the website , which would in turn say to e-mail them about defective products . I ended up just pulling out my old $ 15 Logitech keyboard and tossing this one in the closet where it will never see the light of day again . I really want to try the Saitek Eclipse II , especially considering it has some glowing reviews , but I just don't think I want to risk throwing away another $ 60 .  
  Bought in May 2000 ( same month produced ) - used 3 months , then went away for year . Returned in Oct . of 2001 . In December G3 card failed after only 6 months of use on a $ 1600 + set . Card is about $ 400 plus labor of about $ 300 . Quite a bill for a $ 1600 TV set used 6 months . When working liked picture quality , ease of operation , and overall look for average size family . Really disappointed in Sony - thought we were buying quality product that would last for years .  
  After excellent review from friends I decided to purchase the adaptor . tried to install it on 5 different computers and kept getting the message that it was not a recognized device . Call Lynksis customer service , hours of waiting time , finally able to chat with someone and after some test recommended to return the item as it was broken  
  A very clever little box . No PSU required . The integrated Video / USB connection makes connection a breeze . The only little irritation is a slight delay when switching from on PC to the other .  
  I 'm happy with the cable . It connects my high end pc to my budget monitor which doesnt have an hdmi port . Would purchase again  
  worked as advertised and a great price .. I used it to split a headphone output to two small powered speakers .. thanks a lot  
  I just got this 2 days ago and it 's great ! I was a little concerned that it wouldn't work with my 13 year old remote but it works perfectly with no noticeable delay . I don't know how the battery knows what button you pushed , but it does . I have a receiver set up in the loft that runs my " sound throughout " speakers . I got tired of having to go upstairs every time I wanted to change the radio station or the CD track . This remote extender solved the problem . Highly recommend it .  
  Recently installed this cartridge and it is not printing red correctly . All of the colors are " off ' . Disappointed , I am wondering what is wrong with this cartridge .  
  I purchased the Flip to take with me on vacation over Christmas . I have a vcr video but it is very cumberson and I have to keep changing the vcr tapes . I found the Flip to be easy to use-so easy that my 6 year old granddaughter took videos with it . The picture quality is as good or better than my vcr video and the sound surprised me . I did not anticipate getting good sound but it is great ! The only drawback is that I bought the one that only records one hour of video and then you download it to the computer . Downloading to the computer is simple and I was able to create DVD 's to share with my family . I could have taken videos all day , I was so pleased with the purchase !  
  I don't know what else to really say about this , or any of the MANY Belkin cables I have bought from Amazon , except that they work very well for my requirements . This specific one is being used in my home theater system to connect a component to a switch box . It did not need to be pulled through any walls or stressed in any other way , but it 's been fine for my use of it . Some people think they are not the best of quality but I have not ever had any go " bad " or break or not fit correctly . You * can * get cables even cheaper than these from Belkin , but I don't trust them .. the Belkin cables here on Amazon are still FAR cheaper than what I have seen in stores , and I refuse to let instant gratification make me spend too much for something like this !  
  I bought this player in June 2009 primarily to play AVI files while traveling . I ended up also using it to watch sitcoms during my lunch break at work . I researched portable divx DVD players for months and kept coming back to this less expensive model but was hesitant due to the negative reviews and people claiming the SD and USB ports didn't work on theirs . I finally decided to try my luck and bought the extended warranty through Amazon as well . ( I feel I must note that the warranty is through a third party company and not Colby . Therefore , they will not replace the player or fix it . If your player dies due to hardware failure , they simply give you back what you paid for it . ) To my delight , my player works perfectly . I 've had no trouble with the SD slot , USB slot or simply playing DVDs . In fact , this player plays the Netflix DVDs my Toshiba DVD player refuses to play ! PRO * Matte finish does not show fingerprints , scuffs , or scratches as easily . * Player has some bulk to it . It does not feel like it will break in your hands . * Screen is big enough to make what you 're viewing worth it , colors are bright and crisp , subtitles are easy to read . * Comes with cable and audio / video out feature so that the player can be displayed on a TV . * Comes with remote and remote battery . The remote is a full DVD remote with all standard buttons . * Rotating screen allows you to decide how you want to have the player situated while watching . * Comes with headrest case for the car . It 's flimsy , but it gets the job done and was a nice inclusion . * Sound is nice and loud . No static . * Basic controls are located on the player next to the DVD tray for easy access . * The player can charge and play while plugged in . * There is a car charger cable available for car trips . CON * As I mentioned before , the player only reads SD cards , not SDHC so your card size is limited to 2GB . * On the player itself , holding down the chapter skip buttons does not rewind and fastforward like I had hoped . To rewind and fastforward , you need to have the remote . * If you turn the player off , it will only hold your place while watching DVDs . It won't hold your place in a video file . This one isn't really so much of a con for me , but it may be for other people . * When you switch into SD Card or USB mode , the player immediately plays the first video file . I solved this problem by putting all my files into folders , but I wish it would simply take you to the file directory . * When using the A / V out cable , the video continues to play on the player LCD screen . I have been unable to find a way to turn this off and I suspect there isn't a way to do so . * While charging the side of the player where the jack is does get quite warm . I 'm sure it 's safe and fine , but it 's a little worrying to me . * It 's next to impossible to buy a second battery except for contacting Colby and hoping for the best . I recommend purchasing a microSDHC and USB adapter for video files since the SD card reader doesn't read SDHC . I ended up buying theKingston Mobility Kit - 8 GB microSDHC Flash Memory Card with SD and miniSD Adapters + USB 2.0 Reader MBLY / 8GB ( Black ) . I also suggest a Case Logic netbook sleeve to carry the player in . I have this oneCase Logic PLS-9 Mini Laptop Sleeve , 7-10 " ( Blue ) . The player and the power cord fit in the main compartment . The front compartment easily holds the remote , an SD card wallet , and the A / V to TV cable . It also has a small slot in it for a USB drive , which is where I keep my microSDHC USB adapter . Overall I 'm very pleased with this player . It turned out to be everything I hoped it would be . I 've experienced none of the problems the other reviewers have experienced and I use mine almost daily .  
  We have used the Sony digital camera for business use for about 3 years . It is dependable and has great pics . We use it for product review , and the disk load is easy to use . Stores adequate number of pics and computer ease was my reason for choice . The camera has many features that are easy to use , also . The how to use book is a bit difficult to understand but with a little thought , it is a great purchase for the price . Try it you 'll like it .  
  Although this device would not work on my Mac , I decided to keep it and give it as a gift to a friend that works on a PC . Worked great and the camera is an pleasant perk in a handy small size .  
  The TV is perfect and the delivery time would have been perfect if it wasn't through Global Eagle or whatever the co 's name was . It took them eons to find an availbale delivery date , then I waited 4 hours and stayed home from work , then it finaly was delivered 4 hours after that . Thank goodness my roommate was home by chance .  
  I ordered this product specifically because it is non-SDHC for my Wii . Tiger Direct sent a SDHC version . I called customer service and , since I was persistent in complaining about having to pay for return shipping and the proximity of Christmas , the rep . claimed he would refund my credit card . I guess you could call getting a free card a plus , but I think everyone should be warned you won't get what you want . The rep said they have no regular , old SD cards anymore .  
  I have bought several of these 8Gb and 16Gb cards in the last 2 years and althgough they are fast and highly compatible , I already lost half of the 16Gb batch ( 3 actually ) . They simply died in the middle of a transfer operation , never to recover . I know that flash memory cards are usually not the best media when it comes to reliability , but one of these failed me in less than a week . Never got any problems with the 8Gb versions ( I have 4 of those ) . My advise : use them only as transfer media ( go for the class 10 instead , it is well worth the few extra bucks ) and never , never for backup purposes . And don't dispose of the original files until you have them safely stored on a reliable media .  
  This item was advertised with an MP4 I purchased and didn't fit the MP4 . Useless .  
  I had read the reviews here on Amazon , and then went to the JVC web site . JVC claimed that only " a few " of these decks had the " LOADING " malfunction , and that repairs were " simple . " I decided that , since JVC is ( was ? ) a reputable company , they must have had some problems with the early run of these decks , and that I could trust them to have caught and repaired the malfunction on their later decks . The first deck I bought failed within 15 days , so I could exchange it . This entailed a lot of hassle with UPS deliveries , and I 've never been reimbursed for my cost of returning the defective deck . The second deck took a month to malfunction . So I had to send it to JVC repair services to correct the problem . More UPS , more hassles . The deck was returned after almost a month . The second DVD I played in it caused the malfunction again . By this time I was within a week of JVC 's measly 90-day warranty ( for labor-parts are usually a negligible part of the bill ) . So I gave up . Now I have a sometimes-functioning machine that I really resent . $ 600 for this ? ! ? You 'll want a bigger hard drive ( 80Gb = only 16 hours recording time at DVD speed ) and probably should wait until the second generation of these machines makes its appearance . Would I buy from JVC ? Hah .  
  Got this from my friend who payed about $ 20 for it and then upgraded to USB2 so he gave me the " old " one . It 's great ! I never installed any drivers ! right away I used it constantly to move files from my PC to my PDA , mp3s , e-books , etc . Since a computer just detects it as a removable USB drive , you can use it anywhere with almost any machine . I used it with SD , CF and Memory Sticks , on a Win2k machine and a Linux box . Those " all-in-one " deals are okay , but who wants 6 " Removable Drives " popping up every time you plug it in ? yech . On the downside : This is obviously way overpriced . I suggest buying it elsewhere . And I suppose if you really want to shuffle files directly between cards , this one isn't for you . Note : Never try to format a Memory Stick from your PC using this card reader . Now that adapter doesn't work anymore . :( ( but the rest do :) )  
  This scanner is now older than I even remember . It still works as well as when I got it . I use the VueScan software available online . It just used power from the USB cord . Around the office for the occasional use it gets it performs beautifully if not quickly . It is stored standing on edge in a bookshelf so it hardly takes up any room . VueScan works with Mac , Windows and Linux so anyone in the office can grab the scanner , plug it in , scan , and keep going . I wish everything worked so well or for so many years .  
  When they say battery life is 2 to 3 days , you better believe them . Logitech does give two batteries so you can swap them out . It is a little annoying to have them die so quick especially if you are in a middle of a game . Charging the battery can also be an issue because the charger draws power off USB . If your PC is off , you can't charge the battery . Aside from the short battery life between charges , this mouse is excellent .  
  High quality speaker . Excellent sound quality . Vendor was excellent : warp speed delivery .  
  Dont let audio snobs fool you .. this sub rocks ! Period . Great Bass , large movement of air movement .. you cannot beat it for the price !  
  This was an awesome TV while it lasted . Unfortunately , the awesomeness was less was 2 years . Now the Panel Control Board is out which will be $ 500 to fix . Obviously , it makes more sense to buy a new set . Our old school Mitsubishi has held up 100 percent better . 12 years in service and only two repairs totaling less than $ 800 . 2 years , pathetic Panasonic !  
  I had purchased a cheaper transmitter for " all " mp3 players . I did manage to get it to work on one frequency if I didn't move anything . My coworker bought this Kensington and brought it in for me to try out with my Sansa mp3 player . It worked great on every frequency that didn't have a strong station on it already . For what it 's worth , my car does have a full antenna in the front . There was a little static on some frequencies , but I think that you have to accept less than perfect quality when dealing with these transmitters . Overall , it was a breath of fresh air after that first piece of junk I bought !  
  I really satisfied with the Plasma TV . The color is excellent . This TV also has PC input which is great for me .  
  It works great . It 's just as I expected . Good sound , easy to use .  
  We just got back from a week in Oahu . If you have ever tried to get onto the freeways or navigate around Honolulu you know how crazy the streets are . The TomTom saved us a lot of stress guiding us to beaches , a wedding , restaurants and even to Costco . Now TomTom did have a few problems , telling us to turn left across a concrete barrier and not recognizing some addresses as valid , but even then TomTom just replotted a new route . Signal strength was strong except among the high rise hotels in Waikiki . To get the most out of this product you need to actually read the " map " in real time and correlate the " map " with the actual roadways that you are seeing . A word of warning , the maps of Hawaii are not preinstalled , but are included on the CD . The Hawaii map does fit on the included flash memory card along with the US map . A word of caution : I did encounter some delay in having Windows XPP SP2 recognize the TomTom and I was not able to successfully back up the TomTom to Windows . Despite these difficulties I am still giving the TomTom 5 Stars for putting the fun back into our vacation .  
  This is one of those items you install and forget about . This thing works so well . I have had it about a year now and it has been flawless . I moved my stuff around today and was like " Oh , thats right - I am sending this signal through the wall , and this is the thing that does it " . My equipment is behind the TV which is hung on the wall . The signal goes across my room , through the TV , the wall , and then through the equipment ! Anyway , it works , and very well . There is no lag time or delay .  
  It 's a cable , it transfers data . Not much else to say about it . The price was right for the length that it was and connects my new desktop to the router .  
  This fragile little camera is not built to last . After 9 months of light use , the plastic latches on the interior of the battery compartment door broke . Sony refused to honor warranty and wanted $ 175 to fix it . This problem is so common that ebay has auctions for kits to fix the problem at about $ 40 , but the repair is fairly complex to do at home . The camera is not robust enough even for moderate use . Sony customer service is a joke . If you must buy one , unbroken DSC-W1 's commonly sell on ebay for about $ 30 .  
  Found this case in many camera retail stores , but at $ 24-$30 each ! Much cheaper here on Amazon . It arrived next day ! Use my camera almost everyday and the case never misses a close , belt loop works wwell . The leather stays well , clean . No complaints !  
  Love using this product . The first thing I did with it was make alphabet magnets for my young grandchildren .  
  We can't use this because it dosen't have the support for the Nano 5 . The hole is on the wrong side . If the IPod got pushed too hard , it would break off the plug . Very dissappointing .  
  I bought this in order to add to my growing audio system that I condider mid-fi . The player itself is sturdy and robust . Does not appear or feel flimsy , plasticky , or inferior in any way . The loading tray is the part most susceptible to damage but is also sturdy and opens smoothly . The motor driving it never sounds strained . I don't feel it is difficult to load all five discs at once as others have felt it is . There is enough room to place the back two discs even though it does not open fully enough to expose the tray completely . Thankfully , the tray can also be opened to exchange discs as one is playing . This player cannot play MP3s in file format but can play them when burned as audio discs . Not a problem for me as I don't like the compressed and stripped down MP3 format anyhow . They lack dynamics . The random feature is nice , but I dont utilize it often as I like listening to an album in its entirety . Nevertheless , when I 've used it , it is very quick and comes upon tracks off different discs with ease . Surprisingly fast and relatively quiet as well . The screen is amber colored . The text is just big enough to be seen . It can be dimmed but not turned off . Some of my albums do have CD text encoded and title can be viewed when chosen . Nice feature but never used . Best part is that it is a very neutral sounding player , particularly when using the optical out . My Dark Side of the Moon album sounded as great as my LP of it . Optical out was actually the main reason for my purchase followed by Yamaha reliabilty and thirdly , price . The optical out allows my Harman Kardon 3490 amp use its own DAC which is of very high quality rather than using , what I believe in comparison , the Yamaha 's inferior DAC and it 's anolog out . These two make a great pair ! Great sounding , clear , uncolored music . The player can be mostly utilized without the remote unless random mode is wanted . The remote is properly layed out button-wise . I 'm pleased with this player for the above reasons but wish the main power button on the upper left was thicker as it is the only flimsy feeling thing about this otherwise great player .  
  now i 'm not that technical of a guy , but i know good speakers when i hear them . i 'm a college student and these speakers are more then i will ever need . if you want a sick speaker system for music , movies , video games , basically anything .. get these . i got them on sale for 180 and it was probably the best use of my money in a long time . the sub woofer bumps . shakes my entire apartment . the quality is very good and sharp and can be adjusted to anyone 's liking . the 4 satellite speakers aren't anything super but they get the job done - they aren't supposed to be the power house in this system . its 3 center speakers with in each unit contain two speakers - they deliver good bass and high quality deafening sound . with this system up loud everyone in the room has to scream just to talk to eachother . 130w max output for the 7 speakers , 290w subwooferthe speakers come with everything you need to set them up and are color coordinated and idiot proof . no instructions needed . i have them set up with a sony receiver below which only has 100w output but it works great . couldn't be more happy with my purchaseSony STRDH520 7.1 Channel 3D AV Receiver ( Black )  
  First of all , they hardly worked at all on the scratches . Secondly , these drops ruined my iPod ! The liquid got inside of the clickwheel and messed up the electronics . I repeat , MY IPOD BROKE , AND NEVER WORKED AGAIN BECAUSE OF THESE . DO NOT BUY  
  This product is simply great . Controls work very well , even under the plastic . Armband fits really well , and I have average size arms . This would fit even very large arms well . The band is very stretchy . It ain't comin off , even when sprinting . I wouldn't doubt that this is the best armband out there . Great price too .  
  I got this case for a Canon A80 and it fits perfectly . The main pouch is just the right size for the camera , and the front accessory pocket ( also zippered ) has two mesh holders that fit a spare set of AAs ( 4 ) and a CF card . The materials and construction are very good and the velcro belt strap is one of the best I 've seen . My only complaint , and it 's minor , is that the whole package is a little " thick " when fully loaded . There is a fairly hefty flap covering the accessory pocket that adds a lot of bulk and seems unnecessary since the pocket is zippered . Maybe Lowe felt that it needed extra padding there . It certainly gives them a neat place to put their logo . If the accessory pockets were on the top , bottom , or sides they would have a substantially thinner ( though slightly wider or taller ) case that would fit better in a pocket or purse .  
  Do not buy this product ! I purchased one for my mother , and she could not turn the tuning dial . We returned it for another , and then that one broke . Since it was purchased 60 days ago , Amazon will not handle a refund or replacement , and we must go to the manufacturer . A very big disappointment all around .  
  The card worked for about 20 pictures then started giving errors to be formatted . I formatted to no avail . I called the company I bought it from who then referred me to Transcend directly . Contacting them directly is impossible ! You get no response . My card is currently on it 's way to Transcend and hopefully they will replace with one that works , although I will not use it for anything super important .  
  I bought this mp3 player as the result of good experience I had with a previous Sansa Fuse product . They work , sound good and feel solid in my hand . My favorite thing on this mp3 player is the navigating wheel . It just makes the searching easier and faster when you have thousand of songs . The screen looks sharp and its brightness is right . Battery life is good . I could get more than 10 hrs of music without using too much of the screen .  
  :) Not sure why the current photo as of this review is so odd .. I figure why not buy some shielding that does double duty if I spend a good amount of money on the Canon HV20 .. might as well keep it a little safer right ? Protects and filters .. simple enough . Strange and unclear thing with this , and it just has to do with Canon documentation . They mention to use 1 filter at a time , but the protective filter can be kept on all the time , and the UV stacked on top of it .. so I don't know why they say that . Just makes things confusing and might put off some to not buying something they would easily buy . Edit your manuals and doc Canon ! :)  
  I 'd give this a 1 star only because it can't go any lower . Bought this router about 6 months ago . First month or so worked great , then I started to get dropped signals every few days or so and have had to unplug / replug the power cord just to get a signal again . Then it gets worse and worse .. now I lose the signal daily and have to power cycle it at least once a day , sometimes 3 or more ! Worse , the signal comes in and out when it says " connected " on my computer . Been talking to tech support and customer service for the last 2 months . Finally , tech support told me that they 'd replace my router for me at no cost to me , and would even have someone pick up my old , defective router so that I do not have to pay for the shipping of the old router back to them . In order to do so , I had to call customer service for arrangements . To my surprise ( and my waste of time ) customer service coldly said that it 's company policy that I pay the shipping for the routers . I agreed to settle the issue through replacement because I don't have to pay for the shipping and that since I will supposedly receive the new router first , I will not have any down time not having a connection at home . This was agreed upon with tech support , and customer service decides to change that ? Isn't there some sort of credibility with company promises and first-decisions ? I know it 's their company policy that I pay shipping to send my defective router back to them , but since their techician told me otherwise , should they not also honor the exception ? Sigh , I don't think I can take this any more . I 'm going crazy . Do not buy from Linksys . They suck , they really do .  
  got this to go with the wireless headphones by the same company . the pair work well . Had to install the software twice since I failed to read the instructions first - do the install and when prompted to , insert the device , not device first , then install - that didn't work . also the headphones buttons were a bit tricky , but when you get the RED flashing you will know you have it right to connect the wireless headphones with the computer . So far aok .  
  This card is very helpful , gives the possibility to keep a lot of images . Thank you .  
  I have been a long-time advocate of LaCie . I snubbed my nose at the nay-sayers who complained of the drives . i even doubted that customer service could be this bad . well , i 've come around . I own 6 LaCie Drives . 3 have failed me in the last 4 months . LaCie won't take them back , though the did take one in for service , claim the rattling sound of the fan or something was normal , and send it back to me . granted , they called , but only once and they didn't wait to hear back from me before returning the drive unfixed , and i had to pay one-way shipping ! i am DONE WITH LACIE . when i told them i 'd lost my data , they said i should have had it backed up . wait ! that 's what this drive was for ! sorry guys . but i 'm done . [ .. ] Amazon has been very helpful and they are going to help me in any way they can . Props for Amazon . but don't buy LaCie . as the last review i read told me before i purchased it anyway , " it 's not a question of if this drive will fail , but when . "  
  I am very happy with this product ! One is used in a dorm to store DVD movies and the other was used to hold Wii games . So far , the boxes have been very durable and have not come unsnapped . Additionally , they are attractive .  
  I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews here and must say that for $ 150.00 I believe I got my money 's worth . Before I bought this unit the only way for me to listen to my music CDs was through my desktop computer or through my dvd player and television setup . It was no fun to listen to music through a couple of 10 watt television speakers . This unit 's speakers are very nice for being so small ; they are capable of producing rich crisp booming fidelity ; I can get a nice rich bass and that is important to me . Overall , there is great versatility for adjusting the sound qualities of the music you 're listening to . I love the " music port " ( located on the front of the unit ) through which you can plug in an MP3 player . I plugged my IPOD nano into it and now I can listen to the many iTunes that I have bought over the last year or so without the need for headphones and without the need to listen to them through my computer . I also burned an MP3 disk that has 40 songs on it and played it in the unit . Every track number and title was correctly indicated in the display window at the top scrolling from right to left . I could have put many more tracks onto the disk if I had wanted . You can fit a huge number of music tracks on a cd disk if you burn them as MP3 files . I ' think ' I could have had as many as 200-300 tracks on a single disk ! Theoretically , a person could burn 5 MP3 disks averaging at least a couple of hundred average length tracks on each disk giving you access to a thousand songs stored in the unit . Cool ! I think that the remote control unit is pretty straight forward . There ' are ' a lot of buttons and frankly for a few of them you will have to consult the manual just to be sure what their function ( s ) are , but the manual 's instructions are clear and easy to understand . As others have indicated the stereo unit makes a conspicuous din when either turning it on or off . This sound does not bother me in the least . It 's funny , but to me it literally sounds like the tray of an early era cash register opening - sans the " ding " bell sound effect . I have yet to try the radio but I imagine that I won't be disappointed with it . That 's all I know to say about the unit at this point . If I feel the need to update this review I will . I recommend this powerful little stereo system to anyone who needs one ! I hope that I have been more helpful to you than not . By the way , it just so happens that at this particular moment I have the unit on and the MP3 disk is playing in it . Gordon Lightfoot is singing " The Wreck of The Edmund Fitzgerald " . Wow , sounds great coming through !  
  Remember the printer from Office Space ? Well this is it , in spirit if not in form . Usually it works pretty well .. until you either turn it off or have to replace an ink cartridge . Turning it off , then turning it on again ( regardless of the time between the two events ) typically results in the scanner getting jammed during it 's initialization and making a horrible juddering noise which simply will not cease until the unit is turned off again . Replacing the ink cartridges results in wasting approximately 1 deciduous forest 's worth of paper , as it will print endless alignment pages , but then fail to scan these when they are placed on the scanner as instructed . I have spent way , way too much time fighting with this machine in a futile effort to get it to work . Often multiple reboots have been necessary , and I have yet to work out any method in the madness . Undoubtedly among the most frustrating computer accessory I have ever had the misfortune to come across . HP should be ashamed for even marketing this peice of garbage , and whoever designed it should resign . Oh , wait , corporate ethics is an oxymoron in the US . Guess I can look forward to more poorly-designed crap in the future .  
  This is the most effective and the fastest mouse-cleaning system I have ever used . It cleans the gunk out of your mouse in less than fifteen seconds . The key is the velcro-type hooks on the two sizes of mouse balls , which you insert in place of the regular mouse ball and proceed to move the mouse around on the velcro-loop-type pad . Replace the regular mouse ball and move on to other tasks , your mouse won't trouble you again for a long while !  
  Theses head phones work great for jogging . Snug fit . And the connecting cord to my ipod shuffle is tough and easily routed through my shirt to the shuffle . Moisture isn't a problem either . I even purchased a pair for a friend . Best head phones I 've ever tried !  
  My AMD laptop is hot-headed , so this is perfect for keeping its little head cool during the tough times . :) It also elevates nicely so I can surf with the laptop on my dresser while in bed . Too heavy for every day travel and too clunky for lap-style studying but perfect for desk or dresser-top .  
  I don't know if I got a bad one , but it can't receive the weather radio signal without an external antenna , and I live in the middle of a large city . It is a disappointment .  
  I had two of these dvd players .. 1st one started erroring out with " bAD " showing on the display after about a month . My second unit errored out ( bAD ) after 3 days . I had previously had very good luck with toshiba , so I have no clue what they did with this machine .  
  It 's tiny . It has a power supply and charges your toys . It works a mouse . Drives , cameras , GPS , iPod everything works smoothly . The upright slot is good for flash memory sticks and the like . This piece is worth twice the price , and performs transparently every day . Takes up NO room . Turns one slot into 4 . It is heavier and sturdier than it looks and stays where you put it . Cannot be beat . Mine was $ 12 .  
  Yes , call me old fashioned , but to me percolation is the better method than " drip " coffee making . This is the second Presto I have owned . The last one 's heating element failed after many years of use . My new Presto works extremely well and makes coffee fast and hot . I take coffee to work in a thermos bottle and it is quite hot even up tomid-day . Amazon was the only place I could find a replacement for the last one I owned . I suggest you youngsters ( aged less than 45 ) try out some percolated coffee in lieu of that Mr. Coffee stuff you grew up on .  
  Overall I am happy with this product . I like the carring case and remote . I use the speakers at work in my studio salon so I dont really know how loud they get . I have to keep the music at a repectable level but they sound great .  
  I owned these for a few years , and I found the sound quality to be excellent .. they were very comfortable , and you will notice the difference in sound quality when compared with the standard earphones supplied with most portable CD players . If you know certain songs very well , you will especially notice the difference - you will actually HEAR the bass guitar when listening to rock bands for instance ! I found myself listening to all my favourite songs all over again with renewed interest ! My dog recently chomped on one of these , afterwards it sounded like plastic film rattling inside them , so I ended up replacing these with Sony MDR-ED31LP ( supposed to be the next model up ) , and they are hopeless in comparison ( those earphones don't fit in your ear as well as the rubber inserts crumple when you insert them ) . I should have got these Sony MDR-E828LP earphones again . :-(  
  Sound is only okay-when it doesn't cut out . This seems to happen whenever the wearer breathes too deeply or turns his head at all . And they hurt ! My son wears glasses , so they hurt even worse . Msybe Sennheiser 's more pricey headphones are good , but no luck at all with anything under $ 50 . We returned these , kept on looking , and found super-comfortable , excellently crafted , beautifully designed , great-sounding headphones for just a little more-from Koss !  
  I love my Altec Lansing iPod docking station / portable audio system . My husband bought it for me at our local retail electronic store . Theaudio was great . I loved it so much , that I ordered another for my upstairs from Amazon because they had the best price . I saved over $ 50 . My husband was thinking about buying one for his iPod in our TV room , so he ordered one from Amazon also . The teachers at the school where he works all have the same one . We love ours . We now have 3 in our home . Happy User ( Burleson , Texas )  
  My mother-in-law loved her Mother 's Day gift , but shipping was way slower than we were told . It was not delivered within the Amazon window .  
  MBP users should know that while this product is a perfect size for the 15 " model and it definitely keeps your laptop cooler , there is an issue . The design of the USB connection has the cord attached at the back . In order to make sure that it doesn't block your power connection , you must bend the USB cord waay down . There is still danger of your power connection not being completely in contact as it should be . Also , with the short length of the coolpad 's USB power connector , there isn't an option to plug it in on the other side of your MBP.O , and if you plan to use this on your lap , look first at the contours of the bottom . Although the large feet make a great base on a hard surface , you may want to use a lapboard or something similar between the plastic edges of the bottom surface and your legs . Even with the minor issues ( after fiddling with it a bit and getting things settled in ) I am very happy with this product . It does the trick with my MBP , even when I play WoW .  
  I prefer B & W filters over any other . That 's because they do it right .. nearly EVERY time . I have a number of them for various applications and choose them over other brands at every opportunity .  
  When I found this mouse in a store for the first time , I thought it seemed to fit my hand without sampling . I decided to purchase amazon . com and got it , however , the quality was cheaper than the looks in the package . The worst thing is that it is hard to move a mouse pointer . The amount of the moving of the pointer is very short per one movement even though I changed to max to the movement of the pointer in control panel .  
  This is a wonderful product . It is lightweight , easy to assemble and adjustable for either you CD or DVD collection . Unfortunately for me , I filled it all up and still had to buy two extra DVD racks to store my collection !  
  I have used mine for years , on a Canon eos 20D , then on my latest 40D . I place the camera , with the wireless , facing my birdfeeder on the porch , then I go inside the house , and shoot from there , unsuspected , with the remote . Same can be used in a restaurant , or , with me not being near the camera , in a store window , photographing on-looking shoppers . It 's a discrete way to have natural pictures of people and animals .  
  This SDHC card rocks ! Great price for extreme speed and capacity . Works great in my Panasonic DMC-TZ3 camera at burst speeds . Pictures download fast on computer .  
  My spouse makes frequent how-to videos , and this flexible stand is perfect for mounting the camera in unique positions that a traditional tripod cannot duplicate .  
  I get peace of mind from knowing that my lenses have an extra layer of protection . I 'd much rather replace the $ 10 filter than the lenses that cost much more .  
  This UV filter does it job to protect the lens well . The build is solid ( metal construction ) . The glass is also descent quality . About the performance , it absorbs some UV light . The UV light absorbtion is hardly noticeable , probably the sky 1-A and the haze filter version will absorb more UV light than this lens which is fine for me . Now , about the one problem which is the internal reflection . I 've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . I found out that it is not caused directly by the low light / night situation . The internal reflection will appear when there is a strong / bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure ( the surrounding environment ) . To put it in example ( which hopefully is easier to understand ) , when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection . as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides / corner of the picture ( and not in the center of the picture ) , the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear ( if you move the light far enough from the center ) . And if the light isn't too bright / contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection . but of course most of the time , a lamp at nightime is often very bright . But the point that I 'm trying to make is that the internal reflection doesn't happen all the time during low light or night time . Additionally , the internal reflection isn't only happening at night . it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example . basically same rule as above , on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area , and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side / dissapear ( also depending the angle ) . But the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations . Hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation ( which is not hard to do ) . I 'm actually not a fan of lens filter ( any filter ) as I think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object , but I decided to use them anyway for all my lens . And I would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you don't have any filter for your lens .  
  We bought this to replace an aging clock radio . It has .. some problems . You should buy something else . The biggest problem is this : if you change the alarm at even one minute after midnight on Sunday night / Monday morning , it will ring at the time you set - on Tuesday morning . On Monday morning the alarm doesn't ring at all . Apparently it always sets the alarm for tomorrow morning , which may mean as much as 35 hours and 59 minutes after you set it . We 've had to start setting a back-up alarm clock . Also , the " soothing white noise " features are anything but soothing . Honestly , getting a clock / radio / white noise machine all in one compact device was my primary reason for ordering this . I had visions of the steady , low crash of waves . Unfortunately , the designer had visions of screeching seagulls . All of the " nature sounds " are irritating after about ten seconds ( they repeat without variation every ten or so seconds ) , and much too loud . ( And if you turn the volume down , then it turns down the volume on the alarm , too . ) The only setting we ever use is the plain white noise . And you know what we eventually realized ? You can get that for free on any radio , just by tuning the dial to a spot where there 's no radio station broadcasting ! I recommend that you pick a different alarm clock - one that reliably sounds the alarm , for example - and that if you want a white noise machine , just turn on the radio and save yourself the expense and frustration of a specialized ( and specially annoying ) device .  
  Color and look was alright , but I had to return it since it was tight for the camera .  
  Update : I 've just learned that there is a new v1.03 version of the firmware that is dated December 8 , 2006 . It is supposed to fix the handshaking issues with HDMI and the PS3 ( or any other devices ) . I have updated my review with this new information . I researched the hell out of this TV , as well as many others , and figured I 'd pass on what I found . So here 's a rundown : Most problems that you 'll read about this set ( described below ) only affect those manufactured early on that have older versions of the firmware . The firmware history is a bit confusing because the chronological order is : v1.11 , v1.16 , v1.19 , and then v1.00 and now v1.03 . So , v1.03 is actually the latest firmware , this is important to know . You can tell what firmware version you have by going into the menu . Early versions of this TV with firmware versions v1.19 or prior , display sparkles ( random flickering pixels ) when viewing a 1080p source over HDMI or DVI ( such as a PS3 , Blu-ray DVD player , or PC ) . Sets with firmware version before v1.16 also have an odd power problem where occasionally the TV will have to be unplugged , then replugged in , before it can be turned on . If you have a set with firmware version v1.11 or v1.16 , you can have an authorized technician upgrade it to version v1.19 . This upgrade will fix the power problem , but there is no fix for the " sparkles " problem . In reading what other users have gone through , it seems upgrading can be an arduous process with Westinghouse 's customer service leaving a lot to be desired . There is no way to upgrade the firmware to v1.00 though . This is due to an apparent hardware difference with v1.00 sets . Some users have exchanged their pre-v1.00 sets for v1.00 sets , but I 'm not sure that that is Westinghouse 's official policy . I am not sure if you can have a technician upgrade your v1.00 firmware to v1.03 . The good news is that nearly all new sets being sold now are v1.00 ( or the newer v1.03 ) and have neither the sparkles problem nor the power problem . There are however some handshaking problems being reported between this TV and the PS3 . I don't own a PS3 , so I can't comment from experience . But a lot of users have said the PS3 over HDMI will lose it 's sync with the TV when going from the PS3 menu to a game , or vice versa . Cycling through the inputs of the TV can sometimes fix the problem , but a lot of users have found a work-around by using a HDMI->DVI converter and using the TV 's DVI input . It 's not clear if this issue is the fault of the TV or the PS3 though , because the PS3 seems to be having handshaking issues with a lot of different TV 's . This problem does not exist in those models with v1.03 version of the firmware . As others have noted , the remote is very basic , and the infrared sensor on the TV is pretty finicky , even when the remote is pointed directly at it . The calibration options in the menu are pretty limited , particularly the Fill option . If you 're watching standard definition TV , you can either stretch the image to fill the screen or not , that 's it . The contrast ratio is pretty average for an LCD TV . When viewing dark scenes , there is not much difference between dark hair and shadows etc . This is a problem for most LCD TV 's though . The viewing angle isn't great . This , again , is a problem with most LCD TV 's . If you sit to the left or right of the TV , the colors tend to get washed-out and take on a gray tone . My main problem with the TV though is banding , also called uneven backlighting . Banding is when the TV displays vertical bands of differing brightness . On mine , it is only noticeable when viewing dark or dull scenes , but it can be distracting . Banding differs from one LCD to another , so if you 're lucky you can get one with little to no banding . So having said all that , I 'd still recommend this TV , especially if you don't plan on buying a PS3 for a while ( or can find one with v1.03 firmware ) . The picture quality is great , and you can't beat the price . The calibration limitations and finicky remote are minor issues , and the contrast ratio , while not great , is not much different than what you 'll find on other LCD 's . The same can be said of the viewing angle . Banding can reach unacceptable levels , but differs from one set to the next ( My TV isn't bad but would be perfect if it wasn't for the banding ) . I bought this TV online through Amazon , but if I had to do it over again ( and had the option ) I would have bought it from a local retailer . Dealing with Westinghouse 's customer service doesn't sound very appealing , and it 's much easier to return or exchange it if you have the retailer nearby . I 'm attempting to exchange mine for another ( hopefully with less banding ) , but since I bought it online , it 's a touchy situation that will involve a lot of waiting , and shipping of packages across the country .  
  I absolutely love my G7 cordless ( I 've owned it for over 2years ) ! I was reading the other , less generous , reviews and they 're mostly complaining about , " omg , I have to change the battery every other day , with heavy use ! " But I don't mind replacing the battery one bit , especially because it 's got that " outta ammo , gotta re-load " kinda feel on the quick release . As far as general performance goes , I 've never had a problem , it 's Logitech . In my experience , Logitech = Quality .  
  la tarjeta madre funciona excelente .. es un modelo antiguo pero era la que servia para mi procesador intel pentium D 2.66el envio fue inmediato  
  My power pop finally got a hot spot in the plastic bowl and it went through concentrators like crazy . But that 's been after years of popcorn production . I just ordered another one . What I like about it is that the popcorn stays contained in the bowl and doesn't fly all over the place . And yes , no oil . But best of all , I make batches and batches of caramel corn for Christmas and I don't have to wait between batches for the unit to cool off before popping more corn like a lot of hot air poppers recommend . The concentrators don't last as long as the manufacturer states but it 's a small price to pay for convenience . It pops the corn beautifully , no burning . I couldn't find the popper anywhere in town . Thanks Amazon for carrying the popper !  
  Overall system is good . But there are several limitations - some of which are mentioned in other reviews . One problem is that if you want to receive fax to pdf , you must also connect the printer by USB to a computer - you can't just have a standalone network / ethernet set up . And if you connect the printer to a computer by USB , you can't have that same computer be part of the scan to group over the network ( you can only have that computer be configured to scan to by USB ) . There are other little problems - quirks with the software . But overall I think it 's a decent system .  
  This fkash card worked just as advertised . I have owned a number of them and never have had a problem .  
  I 've been a shortwave radio listener for the past 40 years . Since 1985 I 've been using a Realistic DX-400 for the majority of my listening . I wanted something smaller that was easier to carry around and after considerable research I purchased the Kaito KA1103 . This radio outperforms my DX-400 . It is especially outstanding on the FM and shortwave bands . Regular AM broadcast reception is okay but nothing exceptional . The Kaito KA1103 also receives SSB broadcasts which is a feature not found on many shortwave radios priced under $ 100 . I 've found the SSB reception to also be exceptionally good and stable . In addition to radio amateurs , I 've been able to tune into several commercial aircraft conversations using the SSB feature . Kaito packs this radio with all the accessories you need . You get rechargable batteries , antenna , power adapter , manual , and even a nice carrying pouch for the unit . I also bought the Katio T-1 antenna with my unit but I 've found the supplied antenna to be more than adequate for all my listening requirements . I hesitated before ordering this radio as some reviews knock this product as being " ergonomically hostile " . However , I 've found the radio to be very easy to use though it does take some getting used to . You definitely will need to keep the manual nearby for the first few weeks of use . But once you get used to how this radio operates , you 'll continue to be amazed at its superb performance . Battery life is exceptionally good . I can charge the batteries ( within the radio ) in about 12 hours and that charge will last me 2 to 3 weeks of use assuming I run the radio for about 3 hours per day . Build quality is solid . This is my first Kaito product and I 'm very well pleased with the overall fit and finish of my unit . A great buy !  
  I exchanged my camera from Best-buy after finding the spot on the LCD the very next day . Since then I have had the opportunity to take some pictures and I must say I am very happy results . My wife took the camera for our daughters easter parade and the pictures are excellent . Crisp clear picture of little kids doing their thing as they marched ( or ambled is more like it ) to the chapel . Some people have said that Canon does not deliver true skin tones - for me that myth has be shot to bits ! My daughters class is ethnically and racially diverse and skin tones were delivered flawlessly . Flash is quite effective . I could not find any obvious flaws with it . In fact I like to use the camera without flash to capture indoor shots and I was blown away by the results . Of course , I was capturing inanimate objects . I like the manual setting options . The camera allows you to set defaults for each mode ( except auto ) i.e. exposure , ISO etc . Thats useful if you want more control over your shots . It allows you to shoot in B & W also , which is great ( and Idon't thing the P10 has this - I may be wrong . ) I also bought a 256mb flash Card - and I can get 99 pictures at 5mp . Decreasing the size to 1600x1200 at Fine ( instead of superfine ) gives you approximately 420 images . The flash card ( SanDisk 256mb ) cost only about $ 45 ( it was on sale at best buy and I got 10 % off of 4 Digital Camera accessories . ) What an awesome buy ! P.S : I tried to update my original review but my updates are not reflecting . I  
  Love it , works , good value would buy more . It is crazy what memory is selling for and solves many problems .  
  This cd case is worth the money . I was surprised to get it and find an outer pocket and an inner net pocket as well . Its also nice looking , if that sort of thing appeals to you . The cds stay in place , thats what counts .  
  I purchased a pair of these cards back in July 2009 for my Sony PMW-EX1 , full-size HD Camera . I used them with an MxR Adapter and they worked wonderfully for recording hours upon hours of documentary footage . At the end April this year Digital SLR Cameras were becoming quite affordable and versatile . I purchased a Canon T2i and two more of the Transcend 16gb Class 6 cards . I was on my way to the Middle East to record a graduation and would eventually visit London . Using the Canon T2i indoors was fine , it would of course overheat if used constantly for over 40 minutes . I shot outside one day and let the camera rest every once and awhile . It was hot out . When I finally finished shooting my camera turned off by itself . I learned the memory card had fried . I returned back to the states and brought it to professional specialists who were unable to read the card , even through using a linux machine . I continued using my remaining cards to shoot , but began seeing overheating warnings after 30 minutes of shooting , mostly indoors . Today I was testing out my cards and one of them would report an error after recording 2 minutes on my Sony PMW-EX1 . I have a feeling these cards have low life-span and with the combination of heat and new technology , you may end up losing thousands of memories in a FLASH . Pun intended . I would recommend spending more to save your data and back up CONSTANTLY .  
  I recieved the product quickly and saved abundle compared to the cost in stores . The product was compatible to my equipment and was instantly workable . definitley keep buying from the seller .  
  The Inno2Bk is a high quality product despite its high price . I have found the Inno to work very well in the four applications I have tried ; walking around with a headset , at home attached to my stereo system , in my car and on my motorcycle . In each case , the Inno has maintained a strong signal and delivered a high-quality experience . I would say that installing the antenna on the car without a resulting mess of wire can be a challenge , but the other components work well and easily . I use the vent attachment to hold the docking mechanism and it works quite well . The only limitation for the Inno may be the programming ; either you like XM or you may prefer the Serius which is not available . Personally , I like the range of programming available on XM , except I wish it had an NFL package . I picked the XM programs because of Inno and not the other way around . I looked at other portables , but the higher quality of the Inno is readily obvious when it is compared to other portables .  
  there is no better way to copy slides in an affordable way but making sure that you maintain quality and usability . You are copying ur slides at the full resolution potential of your dslr . I recommend this to anyone , just do some research to make sure the focal length will work with your lens . It takes a lot of extensions .. iv got loads of up and down c rings that i put together to make sure it focused accurately .. if you can work round those problems , u will be blown away !  
  It does its job well . BUT , I was not able to read it in on my computer . You 'll have to check to see if your computer can read this device .. go to the Transcend site to find out before you buy . It obviously isn't backward compatible . Therefore , 2 stars is generous .. got to be able to read what 's on there !  
  exellent for a expence party lan network . since every port is a different game and consola to play , but worthy . xbox best hud network device and every xbox player can not live without it it also work fine on pc  
  This is my 3rd pair of these headphones , but not because they break . Each pair has lasted me 2 years through all weather conditions . I bought a pair of $ 75 noise cancelling canalphones and returned them because these sound better . The design is a bit awkward at first , but once you get the hang of it they are the most secure design for jogging or just holding in the canal for keeping ambient noise out . I have tried at least 12 pairs of headphones and these are the best .  
  I bought this computer december of 06 ' , on black friday , i ended up getting this tv at around $ 500 , at the time the closest thing was over $ 1000 . there is one word to describe this awesome tv .. perfect . maybe its the amazing 1080i picture , maybe its the ability to play all my pc games with stunning clarity ( crysis , COD4 , FEAR ) and have this act as a double monitor , or the Xbox 360 1080i graphics , im not sure , but everything i wanted or wished i had from a HDTV i got with this one .  
  1 GB provides more than enough space to store hundreds of photos at my 3.2-Megapixel campera 's best quality setting .  
  I ordered this camera as a replacement for our venerable Sony P90 which has been having some battery issues lately . Choice was between this or the Sony T100 . In the end went with Canon on price and form factor . The Good - Video quality is excellent ( as long as you don't use the zoom ) . I find myself using this more than my video camera now mainly because of the great portability - Amazing battery life - Pictures look great , still use the SLR for super high quality pics but this will do 99 % of what most casual users need . - Loads of picture ' modes ' with presets , not much fine grain control but didn't really expected in this form factor - It 's tiny , very portable with quick startup meaning you find yourself taking a lot more shots . - Face recognition is a nice feature , finding a lot less reject imagesThe Bad - Supplied SD Card is too small ( as usual ) - No low battery indicator . Warning is given only when the battery is almost out which is unfortunate since the battery lasts for ages and will undoubtedly mean a flat battery when you least expect it .  
  before i review the tv , i 'd like to commend amazon on having the tv delivered 4 days earlier than scheduled . first off , i bought this tv for $ 1599.99 no tax and free shipping which is a great value . the picture is heavenly with hd programming even non hd channels look pretty good . the options on the tv are easy to use . now the negatives , the tv is cheaply made . it looks beautiful but the molding surrounding the screen is flimsy . the final con is the sound which is mediocre for not just this tv but all plasmas , lcds , and dlps . i 've coupled this tv with the samsung htib ht-tx72 and now i have a movie theater in my living room .  
  I have bought these after long search , they are so musicly correct , mid and high are the best in price class , bass is very correct , tighten , enough volume , but these are audiophile headphone , firstable for home listening , with dynamic driver for so realistic sound , sound channeling is great , U can improve sound with headphone amp , quallity is very high and they are very light , you can carry them for hours and dont have headache and no pressure in yours ears but they will worm yours ears , I 'm very happy for having them , very nice , manufacturer should give some carrying case for them , I have listened all kind of music from jazz , blues , rock , metal , house , ambient and they are great with every kind of music , just put them on yours head and listen the music how it should must be !  
  This is one of the best camera 's I have come across . The picture quality that comes from this camera is absolutely priceless . I have gone through many camera 's ( I 'm an electronics junky ) . For instance , I took a picture of a Dove , though a closed window , in the rain . You can actually see the tiny water droplets on the doves back . The photo 's from this camera , look as ggod as professional shots . As far as " Pro 's & Con 's " , I 'd say there are LOADS of " Pro 's " and very few " Cons " . The camera is a little " heavy " compared to alot of the newer camera 's but Panasonic makes up for it in quality . Loads of picture settings for all sorts of conditions , etc . I do find that if you do not a have a fresh battery , some photo 's will come out blurry , especially if you are using the zoom . All in all , I 'd say this is a wonderful purchase .  
  I was so happy with the circular polarizer that I gave away my canon circular polarizer , to a new friend . The canon circular polarizer was also a new one , multicoated , unlike the nikon circular polarizer I own for years . The nikon circular polarizer I own is heavy , 62mm with a 72mm front thread . I do spend a lot for polarizing filters , consider I am not professional photographer . This one , the hoya 62mm DMC Pro I is the best I have . Very happy with the purchase , highly recommandable .  
  This bag is very durable . It fits my Sony DSCH9 camera , a battery , charger , USB cable , and a memory stick . I would have given it five stars if only I could squeeze in the lens adapter and lens hood . I think this would be more suitable for smaller / compact cameras .  
  I bought these because it seemed that they had some really good reviews among other phones in this price range . I was thoroughly disappointed . The sound seemed good enough for headphones at this price . The sound was warm and seemed accurate . But that was the only positive in these headphones and the only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of one . Now for the bad .. First of all , the sound isolation really isn't very good . I couldn't use them in the studio because my drum mics were picking up the mix I had going through them . On that same note , it was impossible to rehearse with them because they didn't block very much of my drums , therefore having to turn the mix up really loud to hear over the drums , which defeats the purpose of isolation headphones to help save my hearing . Which brings me to my next point ; they don't get very loud , which could either be good or bad . Good for long term hearing 's sake , but bad for loud playing situations . Also , they are very cheaply built . They got stepped on in the studio ( not very hard mind you ) and where the phone connects to the headband broke . In other words , these are probably great headphones for somebody hoping to just listen to music through them , or maybe a reference headphone for a studio engineer . However , I would not recommend them to anybody who tours , anybody who is rough on their equipment , or any loud instrumentalists ( drummers ) . In this price range I 'll go back to my Vic Firths .  
  We purchased this as a replacement for one that we had loved and depended on for years . It was exactly as advertised and works perfectly .  
  I purchased this product for my IMac . It more than met my expectations . I truly liked it . I wish Apple would continue with this product .  
  Nike shoes typically aren't the perfect fit for me , but I love using the Nike + sensor as a training tool . This was the perfect solution ! Wish I 'd found it earlier . I did need to recalibrate .  
  We traveled a lot over the holidays and kind of went crazy having to watch all the commercials that we normally skip at home thanks to our DirecTivo . Enter the Slingbox . Setup was easy . The Mac client works great . We have DSL with a uplink speed of only about 500 kilobits / sec , yet once established on a channel , the picture and sound are excellent . Now when on the road , we watch our favorite shows off of our Tivo on one of the laptops , accessing all the Tivo bells and whistles . We can even watch over my Verizon EVDO card . Even though I have it set up using Network Address Translation ( NAT ) at home and accessing through a NAT-style connection remotely , it totally works , which was a pleasant surprise . Because of the Slingbox 's streaming technology , it does play several seconds " behind " what the Tivo is pumping out , making the remote a bit sluggish , but this is not enough of a problem to drop a star on the review .. When accessing it at home , you get a multi-megabit / sec connection , and the picture and sound are extraordinary . A home automation fetishist considering an expensive video distribution system would spend a lot less money and run a lot less cable buying multiple Slingboxes and simply moving the video over ethernet . ( Only one client can connect to a Slingbox at a time , however . )  
  I bought this filter to basically protect the lens of my camera . It arrived in perfect condition - screwed it on my camera and took several pictures . No difference in image quality . This is just what you want at a great price .  
  very goo dlights very bright make your case look sweet only thign tho that sound light didnt work but it is ok it still turns on  
  I bought this cd player close to a year ago and am satified to say that it hasnt given me problems until recently . Id like to add to that though that it was my fualt .. go figure . I highly reccomend this item for anyone who likes to listen to music without all the skipping , and stopping etc , but without the large price tag . My favorite features of this player are the bass boost , volume limiter , ( avls ) and the 4 different play modes . i would have given this product 5 stars if it had a pause button . But hey , no biggy . Hope this will help you with your purchase .  
  I have a Rebel XTi and wanted to make sure I had enough battery power to last through a couple of photo sessions and saw this battery and thought it would be a good back up . The battery itself works well but fills a little cheap to me . Overall the battery does the job .  
  I used to think that some reviews for blank DVD media were unrealistic . People complain about dozens of discs that would not burn . I figured they were experiencing user-related issues , rather than technical ones . However , I now know their pain . I bought some Memorex discs from Fry 's and 46 discs were bad out of 50 . I was very pleased that this Verbatim DL 50-pack was 100 % good . Not one bad disc . Perhaps my experience is not a statistically significant representation of each company , but based on the other reviews of this product and my recent observations , I will choose Verbatim exclusively in the future .  
  I purchased one of these simply because I tired of my friends with Ipods , Ipads , and Iphones always coming over my house with dying devices and complaining . My friends absolutely love it . It has 3 components there is a car charger connected to the main charger via retractable usb cord , AC charger also connected via usb cord , and finally the retractable usb cord . This is the only part of the accessory I do not give 5 stars and it is only because the cable is short and it has a thin feel to it that I worry about snapping when I do extend the cable . But for the like 2 bucks I paid for this definitely can't beat it . Save yourself a trip to the Apple store and just buy one of these u 'll more than likely love it  
  This came recommended by a freind - and it measured up to my expectations . The Bluetooth is really cool . Love the ease of use of the touch screen . The windshield mount isn't perfected yet .  
  I bought these speakers for my MacBook . 1 ) The design is great , with the retractable USB cord that can be hidden totally inside . They 're very light & seem sturdy . 2 ) The volume is very good . The internal speakers at full volume are the same as these at 1/4 volume . 3 ) Sound quality is ok . The internal speakers sound slightly better at the same volume . These are fine for casual listening but they sound a little more tinny than the internals . That said , the extra volume more than makes up for this . With these speakers one can hear music right across the house . 4 ) Mute key & volume controls on the speaker are good . Curiously , on the MacBook they work even when the built-in speakers are selected . Also , after selecting these speakers , unplugging them reverts to the internal speakers , then reconnect the USB and they 're again automatically selected which is nice - rather than having to go to System Preferences every time . Also very nice , the Mac remembers volume and mute separately for the internal & USB speakers , so re-connect them and the volume is where you left it for these speakers , not where you had the internal speakers set . Bottom line : not for audiophiles , but for casual music , Skype / iChat , etc . these things are great and provide all the volume , portability and convenience one could want .  
  I just bought the CP-200 to go with my S50 camera . Setting it up was very easy when it came to the camera and printer working together , haven't yet tried it with my computer . Because I do TRUE Dye Sublimation , I thought this printer was also going to allow me to do transfers , not so . I 'm a tad bit disappointed that you have to buy SPECIAL paper for this printer . No where does it tell you this . This will mean that you will always have to carry a lot of extra stuff with you if you want to be able to print while on the road etc . I haven't decided if I 'm going to keep this printer or buy the HP ink jet printer . The one good thing is with this printer your pics will last a lot longer then a ink jet .  
  I bought these speakers for my dad and thought that they would be pretty good speakers since they kept getting good reviews .. Once I hooked them up for him , all I thought was Oh My God .. these speakers were amazing . The clarity was crystal clear , the base was nice and clean and extremely deep . When I watch a movie , it feels like your actually part of the movie b / c of the life like clarity . I never thought these little speakers would be as nice as my Infinity Floor standing speakers with 15 " of woofer plus my JBL surrounds .. but they are . So , when I buy a flat panel TV , I will definitely be purchasing a set of these for myself to replace the speakers I have .. And to think , my speakers ran me about $ 1800 and these were purchased for $ 400 .. wow !  
  Excellent product meets my needs and my expectations , previously had a model cibershot of 4.1 megapixels .  
  What a great product . I am responsible for over 40 locations that all have broadband access . When broadband goes down , the site cannot function . With this product , all I have to do is replace the site 's router with this one and we are back in business until the site comes online again . We had a site that had their service turned off because someone connected their laptop to the network and the laptop was a ZOMBIE mass emailer . With the KR1 , I was able to connect each machine to the router one at a time , update the AVG anti-virus , Adaware and Spybot software and then check the machine . When we found the ZOMBIE , I was able to isolate it and then get the broadband vendor to turn the service back on . The speed of the connection is amazing . We use Verizon 's PCMCIA 5740 with great results . The speed is even faster than when the card is installed in my laptop . Would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who needs a versatile high speed connection to the internet . One thing .. Be careful as to how long you keep the connection active . I have heard of user 's service being turned off after a week of constant KR1 use . Even though most vendors have unlimited use for a monthly fee , most state it needs to be used by only one computer at a time .  
  We have it in the baby 's room . When it 's on , and the water is flowing out of the tank , it makes too much of a bubbling sound and wakes up baby . We had it in our bedroom for a while , and it even woke me and my husband up throughout the night .  
  first time I plonked in a dvd I was amazed . The unit itself can be frustratingly slow at getting to the point where one can actually hit the play button , but there on in it is smooth sailing with a quite amazing picture . In comparison with regular DVD 's there is absolutely zero comparison , even when regular discs are upscaled on high end equipment . It is even more obvious the larger the screen , as mine are veiwed on a 72 inch 1080p , so flaws are pretty much readily apparent . My only gripe is not so much with the player , which at $ 400 is basically a cheap experiment should HD DVD lose the format wars to Blu Ray ( which average $ 900 and up for their players ) but with the complete absense of good Medium , as far as movies go Blu Ray has FAR superior movie titles . However I have a gut feeling that the offending studios may realise that there is dollars to be made on both sides of the fence both HD DVD and Blu Ray , one can only cross fingers .. until then I will watch Pirates 2 in lousy standard definition , and Batman returns in HD ..  
  Using it right now as i type , great machine great speed , did some low cost upgrades to it and shazam works even better  
  Accurate and well worth the money . Only cons is that the visual alerts are somewhat small and not very helpful . The audible alert should have more different tones for different types of radar and a better visual alert to accompany it - overall it is well worth the $ 70 I paid for it  
  Excellent product ! I don't know how I found my way before I bought it .. good price and nice features .  
  I saw this and thought it would be great to have the grandkids pictures with me all the time . I didn't expect it to be as nice as it was . The picture quality is great large enough to see the pictures well . I may purchase another as a gift ! The pictures were easy to download too .  
  Usual Hoya build quality , this is one of those rare filters that I 've tested to show NO difference in photo quality with and without the filter . It 's staying on the lens .  
  It works exactly like a memory card should work . No reason to pay high prices when you get get this this cheap . Amazing .  
  Installed CD then card on XP with no problems . My only issue is that it appears to like only to use the Linksys monitor software instead of the Windows XP Wireless one . Recommend purchase if you are using older 11b .  
  After first conection device was working good , after 4 - th conections was dead ! I plugged into system , the device just keeps clicking clicking clicking amounting to nothing , wont mount to system . eThese things are cheap , sleek and cute looking but I would not trust them with any important data . I lost all my data ! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT ! SAVE YOUR MONEY and don't give it to companies such as this . Outside looking good inside big piece of junk !  
  This camera was replacing my HP Photoshop M407 . That one is broken , It had gotten dropped and now the lens does not want to close in it . I hoping to get it fixed one day . Since we paid $ 280 . Brand new . Several yrs ago . Even bought the charging deck to go w / it . That was my first Digi . Camera and I was hooked . Before all I used was my Pemtex ME Super 35mm . Even went and took a close in how to take better pictures . And learned all the little trick that mags . use to do their photos as well . I 've done several " ghost " shots my self . My second digi was a HP Photosmart M425 , That I 've had for close for 7or 8 yr now . Just had started having a little prob . w / fuzzy pics . So , I bought this camera from Joe HP Photosmart M307 3MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom . And let me tell everyone it is just exactly like the first one that I had . It is a great camera it is very easy to use . If you are really into cameras and want a fun one this is the camera for you . It has multiple options that you can choose from . And just have fun with . I know I have been very busy , this past Christmas . Since I had to take a toad of digi 's . And hours of vid . Can't wait until next mon . I 'm planning on getting another digi from Joe . Plus I 've told my sister about him . She just may start buying from him as well . Great product Joe , Norma Tate  
  Awesome device . My wife and I take these kayaking in Florida . Great for personal music collection and the FM radio is great for listening to weather when necessary .  
  This connector allows both the HD video AND the 5.1 sound to be transferred through the same HDMI cable . I use it to connect a PC with an nVidia Geforce 9600GT ( made by PNY ) to my receiver and further to my living room LCD . It works just fine . For 5 bucks , go for it , there is no reason to waste time looking for something else .  
  This company offers overpriced screens and is unresponsive and unfriendly to customers who have a problem . If you want a less expensive screen protector of simiilar quality , try Clarivue .  
  I was impressed with the canon 's sd600 's size and simple features . However , the camera struggled to take quality pictures and color saturation was low . I took pictures side by side with my old Canon A70 and a Sony Powershot .. and even the 3.2 megapixel images looked better . The quality of the lens or something in my camera was off and I returned it . It may have been my individual one , but I 'm looking elsewhere . Not impressed .  
  I bought this to replace a venerable Apple LaserWriter in hopes that I would get good quality printing , faxing , scanning , and perhaps some OCR . It does some of these things OK , and others not at all , despite the promises . Photocopies come out OK - as long as you don't require much subtllty in shadings , and as long as you 're not trying to copy originals with light colors . It does fax OK , although sometimes it 's hard to figure out if a fax went through OK . I mostly fax from my desktop , and only occasionally from hard copy . When I fax from my desktop , I have to turn this machine off , or else it intercepts my OUTGOING fax as if it were an INCOMING fax , even though I 've firmly instructed it not to answer incoming faxes . As for printing , it does an OK job , but it 's neither a TrueType nor a PostScript machine . It is , instead , an emulator , and sometimes you get something close to what you want , and sometimes you get something that looks suspiciously like Courier . Scanning is very hit-or-miss . Sometimes you get an acceptable scan , sometimes the scan doesn't come out worth a damn , and sometimes the software just balks at doing anything and says " There 's a problem . Please restart your machine . " Since this fixes nothing , you wind up swearing at the machine instead of getting any work done . OCR is a complete waste of time . To put it bluntly , the software for Macs that is bundled with the machine isn't even an honest attempt , and it seems clear that Brother really doesn't care because it 's so clunky , and incompetent . I suspect that they just bought any old piece of software that had " Mac " and " OCR " in the product description , purely so they could say they had it . Don't even think of trying to use it . I will continue to use this machine for a while for copying , faxing , and printing , but it 's a compromise machine that does nothing very well . Not Recommended .  
  I bought this after comparing several speaker systems for my iPod . I really like the the sound on the Altec , especially for its price . I also like having the FM radio built in . BUT .. the unit stopped playing my iPod after about a month .  
  Watch out if you buy the mouse 6000 . The wheel on my mouse has gotten progressively harder to turn over the year I have been using it . I finally tried cleaning / lubricating the wheel with eyeglass cleaner and BreakFree CLP . It helps for a minute , then it is back to dragging . I believe the wheel is rubbing on something in the housing . The wheel tries to do too much : tilts to side and depresses for clicks . I have two cheeper models which are a pleasure to use compared to this one . For $ 70.00 bucks I should not be looking to replace it . Ken  
  Well I 'd ordered before , had a great deal on cartridges About # 24.00 as I remember .. Couldn't remember the dealer tho ' .. so this time ordered and paid $ 14.00 for similar cartridges .. two of them clogged already .. right out of the box . Better buy " better " cartridges .  
  This printer is very good . I had it for about 3 years and I use it to print almost everything , from letters , envelopes etc . The biggest flaw I would say would have to be the occasional replacement of products . There are about 3 additional parts that require replacing ( this is not including the 4 ink cartridges ) While this is normal for most laser printers , the cost of these parts go well over the inital cost of the printer . The fuser alone sells for $ 350 , the transfer roller around $ 60 , the imaging unit $ 330 , and the 4 cartridges around $ 100 each . When you add everything up , it comes up to be almost 3 x TIMES MORE than the printer it self ( which is around $ 450 ) so basically , every year , you would be buying 3 printers .  
  On the plus side : 1 . This cassette adapter works in my Passat 's stereo , unlike the Sony adapter , which did not . 2 . Sound quality and usability are both better than the iTrip . One the minus side : 1 . The sound quality is miserable . Bass is almost totally missing . The midrange dominates , and most of the high end is muted . This problem is so bad that adjusting bass / midrange / treble on my stereo cannot compensate . For reference , actual cassettes sound great in this same stereo . 2 . This cassette adapter has gears in it that make both spindles turn when one is turning . This is probably what makes it work in my stereo , however it does make some sound . The end result is some mechanical noise that gets in the way of quiet parts of the music .  
  The card work the first two or three times I used it . Then it stopped working . I can't read or write to it anymore .  
  After opening the box , my first impression was that it was a very nicely packaged unit with slim lines and weighed hardly anything at all . The keyboard was small , but I expected that from a little netbook . After awhile I got used to the size and being without a left shift key . I was excited to try out the Ubuntu Remix that I heard so much about . After booting up , I had no trouble navigating around but found that after about an hour of getting to know this netbook , it just froze up . After rebooting , it would work for another 15 minutes then freeze up again . Attempting to connect to my wireless router proved to be a challenge . It constantly dropped the signal and everytime I closed and came back to use the internet , I had to re-install it to the wireless . There were no instructions other than a brief pamphlet guiding you through the quick start set-up which was no help at all . When going to the Ubuntu site on my PC , I felt at a loss as the procedures for trouble shooting and setting up was beyond my technical abilities and comprehension . After many attempts it finally did work fine until 2 weeks later when I took it on a business trip ( the reason why it was purchased in the first place ) . After initially connecting to my hotel wi-fi , I had the same problem of the dropped connections and re-installing every time I turned the computer back on . Freezing as soon as I logged on and error messages got me so frustrated that I took it down to the neighborhood electronic superstore for technical help . Unfortunately , after the techician 's attempts at trouble shooting it , he found that it was the Ubuntu OS that was causing the problem . Not being too techinically literate and not having much time since I was late for my meeting , I could not understand the problem so I gave it up for loss . I decided to take a quick look around the store and see what they had to offer , being that I needed a computer desperately . I hurriedly purchased another well-known brand with the choice of Ubuntu or Windows XP . Needless to say , I purchased the familiar XP which to this date has given me no problems after almost a month . Granted , Ubuntu Remix may be a great system for some but I 'm sorry that it did not work for me . I was very excited to be able to change over from windows because of all the good reviews that I 've read and would have loved for it to work out . I 've decided to keep the little Sylvania and install the Windows XP on it for my niece .  
  THIS LITTLE ITEM ARRIVED YESTERDAY AND THE PRODUCT FEATURE LISTED INCLUDES " AUTO-REVERSE " THIS UNIT DOES NOT CONTAIN AND HAS NO AUTO-REVERSE AS LISTED ON THE PRODUCT FEATURE AD ON THE WEB-SITE , SO BACK IT GOES , A REAL SHAME TOO ( THAT 'S THE REASON I PURCHASED IT ) - HAS REAL GOOD TONEAND A GOOD SOUND FROM MAKING A RECORDING BUT WANT & NEED AUTO-REVERSE AND THIS UNIT DOES NOT HAVE IT  
  Magnavox 37MF231D 37 " Widescreen LCD HDTV with HDMIMy husband and I purchased this TV from Sam 's Club about 15 months ago . It died last week and is in the junk pile behind the TV service shop I took it to . The service repairman explained that companies were required by law to provide parts to repair their products but they do not have to now . I am extremely disappointed that this TV , whose manufacturer 's name I trusted , died so soon when other TV 's we have had and still have are going strong .  
  This was the first mp3 player I bought . I spent a good while looking around for the best deal , and the iriver seemed to be it . Besides just looking sweet , it has an FM tuner , a microphone , able to read text files and view pictures , not to mention the great amount of space on the hard drive . If this worked properly , I would have given it 5 stars . Mine however ( which i did buy online through Amazon-never buy small expensive digital things over the Internet ) froze up the first time I used it . I had the system requirements , followed the manual exactly , but the product did not work . It stayed frozen until the battery died , and once bought , you can't get a new battery . I couldn't get through to iriver at all , by phone or email . So I contacted the seller , J & R ; music , whose only option was to replace the dead thing with another product of the same price because iriver production had been discontinued . And I had to pay for the shipping and handling ! When I finally received the replacement , it had already been more than a month since the iriver had gone dead . I was ripped off . Should 've listened to a few of the other negative reviews on here . I give the iriver 2 stars only because if it actually worked it would have made a nice little investment .  
  I have no complains about the sound quality of the subwoofer but .. I received the product today with the speaker grill cover broken , the manuals were crumpled , looks like they sent to me a returned iten , can't confirm that was but looks like . Another thing is the price , they droped the price on amazon 1 after after I bought , I should return and buy again in another place but I won't do it , I hope amazon can take care of that .  
  From a software standpoint this device is a marvel . Especially with the firmware update 1.12fp , allowing one to pickup where you were when you turned the unit off . One quibble with the software even there though is that you have to choose whether to play an uncompressed audio ( wav ) file CD OR a compressed data ( mp3or wma ) file CD . You cannot play a CD with mixed audio and data files . However , my biggest quibble is with the hardware design . The way I see it if you are at home there is no need to use the device because you can use your computer to play files . This leaves either in the car or outside . They warn you for safety reasons not to use the player in the car . And , as has been pointed out by others , if you are even walking , the skip protection is useless ! So from a practical standpoint , the only way to get use out of this device is to buy a car adapter to use in your auto . I 'll wait until they provide 1 ) Much better skip protection and 2 ) an auto adapter which comes with the unit . Providing a belt holder on the case is inane or worse ! Who would continuously stand still to listen to files ?  
  This battery 2mm longer and 2mm wider then original , doesn't fit slot in the telephone .  
  2 of the 4 rechargeable batteries doesnt works at all . They are suppossed to be new and they dont work ! I would spend 5 dollars more buying a Sony Charger . But i will never buy TechB , its terrible . I Hope Amazon takes the advice of no sell such bad things .  
  I purchased the 8GB Creative Zen V Plus player during the first week in February . Today , March 6th , I am returning it and this is why : The package arrived from Amazon . I loaded up the software on my computer , then hooked up the player through the usb cord . I let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state . Then I proceeded to load some of my music onto the player . So after the music was loaded , I disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music . The sound quality was good , the player is easy to navigate in the menus , etc .. The problem was about half the music I uploaded was not on the player . I could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there . So I plugged the player back into the usb cord , and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer . The file was there and I could play it just fine through Windows Media Player . I tried to access it again through the player and it was not there . Then I accessed through the computer just fine . All my songs , all 4,500 of them , are in MP3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs I ripped from cd 's . The player just wouldn't read about half my songs . There was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize . I would load an entire album of 15 songs and I could only play 6 or 7 tracks . This happened with my entire music collection . So I thought maybe the firmware was out of date so I uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update . It did not solve the problem . I then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the Zen V Plus onto my 3 year old Rio and original Ipod Shuffle and they played just fine . I was frustrated at this point so I called the Creative Customer Service . It is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now I understand why . They have the worst customer service / tech department of any computer / electronic company I have ever spoke with . After three calls , never speaking to someone who I could fully understand as English was definitely not a first language , more like a 3rd or 4th language , I arrived nowhere . They kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem . No email ever came , checked the junk folder and every other possible place . So I tried a fourth call . This guy basically called me stupid from what I could understand , saying " I can't believe you Americans " and then mumbled something in another language . I asked for a supervisor . He told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days . Then he hung up . I was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature . They really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way . So I am returning the Creative Zen V Plus player and I also don't plan on buying anything from Creative again . By the way , after all this , the problem never was fixed . Also , when doing research on this product , I came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play DIVX files . This is not true . This player will not play any files without being converted first . I took an AVI video that was 100MB and it converted it into a 1.2GB file . The format they use is absolutely a waste of space . If you want to upload an entire movie on MPEG or AVI format , it will end up taking the entire 8GB of space if not more . I converted the movie Cars for my son on a short road trip thinking I could have my music plus his movie . I was wrong , the movie took up 7.1GB after being converted . I would not recommend this product to anyone . As much as I don't like the IPod , I would recommend it over the Zen V Plus because : 1 . It plays all my music 2 . They have a customer service / tech support that helps you and cares about its customers . I hope this helps anyone looking at this player . Jeff  
  The " pull here " sticker leaves glue on the screen protector ! Now I have an iphone with a big bunch of glue on it 's screen .. Would have been better off without this product .  
  First problem : THIS ONLY WORKS WITH THE MAGIC PAPER ! That 's right , after the 60 pages of paper that ship with the pen run out , you have to buy special paper ( 80 sheets for $ 10 , plus about $ 6 S / H , which works out to $ 0.20 cents per page ) . The pen does not digitize anything you write on regular paper . So this really is the gift that " keeps on giving " .. Personally , I require far more flexibility than being forced into using certain specialty paperstock - exceptionally expensive paperstock at that . Where I 'm from , we 'd call this a scam . Beyond that , I was unimpressed with the ergonomics of the pen . It 's fatter than most big marker pens , so it was difficult for me to write with - it felt awkward and my handwriting simply didn't flow well . If you must have this sort of product , I 'm sure it will work quite well for you . I have no comments to make on how it functioned on a technical level . For me , the pre-conditions were a deal-breaker . This was one holiday gift I sent back in a hurry .  
  I loved this popcorn popper , UNTIL I ran out of the concentrators that were provided with the popper . After looking at numerous stores to find the replacement concentrators , I realized that I was going to have to buy them online . Then , I realized that if I buy more concentrators , I am going to be paying almost what I payed to purchase the popcorn popper , just in replacement pieces and shipping and handling ! I will be looking for another popcorn popper .  
  I would 've given no stars but apparently that isn't an option . I bought this amp a few months ago , and it performed adequate , so I figured I would keep it instead of pony up more dough to get another one . And then randomly it stopped working . After two months of usage I could no longer turn my stereo on loud enough to hear it . It would continually shut off . So I asked to return it , and they complied , and now that I have shipped it back to them , I am only getting a partial refund . This is a joke . I would never buy any electrical equipment from this seller ever !  
  ipod 2G does not work as I found out later . The " works with all ipods " line is a lie .  
  I bought this particular DVD player at Best Buy , and while it does what it 's supposed to do , which is play DVDs , its build quality is mediocre at best . With a 4 year warranty in hand , I 've had to replace my unit 4 times now . Problems include - no audio from speakers , black and white picture instead of color on the screen , and recently , the lid just won't close . If you want a cheap DVD player , you probably cannot do better than this . I highly recommend getting an extended warranty though . It 'll definitely pay for itself in the long run .  
  The was a refurbished product I purchased from the buyer . This cartridge has clogged my printers ink head and / or leaves the text skimpy looking even if I have cleaned the printer heads . I would not buy from this buyer again . I probably will never buy re-furbished cartridge again .  
  There is no driver support for modern PC 's - DO NOT BUY . As a PC enthusiast I 've been using 64 bit operating systems for 6 yrs as they support more than 3gb of ram .. I was appalled to see this product not support that .  
  My friend has this printer and he says its horrible ! The print quality is awfull . Though , it 's speed is fast , this is a horrible quality printer . Two of my friends on Compaq computers . One put it in the garage a year ago and has been happy with his new one . My other friend suffers from having one with Windows 98 ( not to mention incredibly slow ) and is going to get a new one soon . Compaq I guess is just a horrible company .  
  I have a ( now-discontinued ) Lexmark C532dn color laser printer . " D " stands for duplex ( prints on both sides ) , " N " for networking . The C532 series got so-so reviews , and consumables are extremely expensive , we own it and I am loathe to toss a huge chunk of working machinery . I should have listened to my own instincts . Despite the claimed number of impressions , these printers use up toner at an amazing rate - expect half the number of impressions claimed . I vowed to replace the original starter cartridges with ' hi-yield ' cartridges to try and eke out some savings . The printer requires cyan , yellow , magenta and black cartridges . I replaced the cyan , yellow and magenta cartridges at ( what I think of as ) colossal cost . Then it came time to replace the black . Got an error code " cartridge not supported " . After the usual annoying search on the Lexmark web site , I located a tech reference ( SO3600 ) that provided several steps ( including firmware upgrades ) as suggested steps . Needless to say , my printer fell into the " contact customer service " category . Customer service referred to its notes and informed me that the C532dn does not support the hi-yield black cartridge ( although it supports hi-yield cartridges for the other colors ) , that there was no fix , and I would have to return the opened cartridge to my distributer ( and good luck with that .. ) . This is Dilbertism to the max . There is absolutely no technical reason that the 532dn cannot support the black hi-yield cartridge when it fully supports other hi-yields . The more likely explanation is that the firmware printer routines that are intended to enforce cartridge ' no-refill ' and gray market , etc . policies were simply not correctly programmed and someone forgot to add the black hi-yield cartridge in the table of authorized cartridges . The stupid business model - ' cheap printer - insanely expensive toner ' - is basically anticonsumer . My advice : find a manufacturer that cares and stick with them . Lexmark is now on my list of banned suppliers .  
  I have just returned the Monster IEE cable [ .. ] after comparing it side by side with an inexpensive [ .. ] cable . It is all marketing hype as far as IEE link is concerned . { The less expensive } cable worked as good as the Monster Low Noise , Gas injected etc . cable . So do yourself a favor save some money .  
  The Mpio is a so-so player that can be extremely costly if you want to hold more than 2 hours of music . Its a very sleek and cool looking device with many different options and modes to keep anyone entertained , such as the radio , and voice recorder amoung other things . The real downside to this player is its lack of memory , and upgradability . It costs me nearly 75 bucks for a new sd card . :( . I also own a sony NE-410 minidisc player ( also $ 100 ) and it has been much better in many cases . It holds 5 hours of music on one 1.50 minidisc . It has served me better than the mpio .  
  This is a very cheap piece of equipment . I had another version of this that came with my camera that looked very similar but worked much better . This product is a very cheap replacement and I recommend you don't waste your money and instead choose one that may cost a bit more . It does not bend well , springs back immediately to where it wants to be , and will not stand up on uneven surfaces very well . Choose another !  
  I wished I could give this zero stars ! I took a risk and ordered this DVD despite reading some bad reviews . I wish I would have taken those bad reviews more seriously ! After less than 2 months of using this DVD , it completely stopped working ! Ridiculous ! I had just started a video in it and it was off . I cannot get it to turn on at all . It worked fine for the first month and a half , but not it 's a paperweight . Do not waste your money ! We even tried to contact Mattel concerning this and no response . My poor daughter is so upset that the DVD player Santa bought her is ruined !  
  though i didn't buy these headphones on amazon i still wanted to write a review . i have owned these once before and i thaought for the money that they were pretty good they lacked bass but i can live with that , i owned that pair for 2 years before they died . so i baought a second pair just a couple weeks ago and already the one driver is distorting at low volumes . dispite the problems i 've had i would still tell people to buy them because of the price and sony is generaly a good brand .  
  I bought this to replace a Canon UV filter that rolled down a mountain . Yesterday I was at Lake Louise taking pictures outside of beautiful scenery only to find that this Tiffen filter created a problem where there were reflections of the lens and adapter for the filter on my pictures ! The reflection problem was sometimes just an extra smudge on the bottom - but very obvious and pretty bad . It was worst in very bright conditions . I am going to order the Canon filter again . The problem was not that I had any condensation or smudges on my filter , because I had cleaned it off that morning . Given that most of my pictures are with lots of light / outside , this is useless to me and I regret bringing it with me . I will finish this trip out without this filter .  
  I purchased these earbuds and no matter which sleeves i tried i could not get them to stay in . I tried all 3 types . Even the extremely cheap foam ones and nothing amazing happened . I could hear just about everything that was going on ( OUTSIDE ) of my headphones . Finally i got them to get a good seal but then every time i got them to seal it would put a painful pressure on my eardrum . Extremely uncomfortable . ALso the sound lacked bass . The highs were good but it sounded unnatural . I listen to classic rock , jazz , some punk , and a little blues . I returned these 2 days after purchasing them . I switched them for the JBL Reference 220 's . Same idea with the in ear design but a lot more confortable to wear . They work great . The sound is crisp and clean plenty of bass for you bass lovers . You really dont even need to turn on a equalizer . JBL has been in the business for a long time now and know what they are doing . Also it comes with a nifty case with lots of cool adapters . I took these on a plane and they are amazing ! Superb cancellation . I couldnt hear the jets roaring or anything . My suggestion . Get the JBL 's a tad bit cheaper and better sound .  
  This product worked well for the first 90 days . The highest setting was pretty loud . But at least it worked . After that the humidifier had a very poor efficiency . This is one of those items that you have to constantly replace .  
  It broke both times . I returned it . You stand on teh cord once and it breaks . Amazon do you have a wireless one ? It would be nice . Get one !  
  The device worked well and was a joy to use . For about two months . It then refused to turn on . I had to send it back to Archos . About a month later I receive a replacement . The replacement had a shoddy D-pad and couldn't recharge . Obviously nobody even checked to see if it worked before sending it to me . Had to send it back . It 's been about 5 weeks so far and I have to keep calling , listening to some lady who only works there 2 days a week complain about all the problems they have with the warehouse . I regret this purchase more than anything I 've ever bought .  
  Though my printer was listed as supported by this device , it would not work ( using WIndows XP Pro ) . I tired it my new computer with Windows 7 and could not even load the software . So all in all , a big waste of money .  
  I received the flash card about two weeks ago . I used it in my canon XSI , which worked as expected initially . After taking about 500 photos , I decided to copy the picture over to my desktop . I 'm not sure what happened , but when I tried to copy the photos to my computer , the files were not readable . I could only retrieved 20 pictures out of the 500 photos I took . I brought this from ChiTek , hopefully they 'll exchange for a new one . Anyhow , relability is questionable for this flash card . I never had a flash card broke on me before .  
  I purchased the internal version DRU-710A of this drive about a week ago . I didn't buy the drive from Amazon - so don't blame them for the bad service part . But after the experience I have just had I wanted to alert anyone who is considering buying a SONY to think twice ! My problem with the drive is that I can write to it - or at least I appear to be writing to it - but then I am unable to read anything . I have blazed through 20 CD 's and still no luck . I found some evidence on various consumer postings that I was not alone in my frustration which only half way consoled me since I was now faced with needing to get my money back . I purchased the DRU-710A from MWave . com along with several other items in the construction of a new system . First of all , unless you want damaged , defective , dented goods ( not just this drive that did come sealed in a Sony box ) - don't ever buy anything from that company . And returning items to them is like pullilng teeth . When I attempted to return the Sony DRU-710A I was told that since it was a Sony product I would have to return it to Sony directly . I realized immediately that I was in it for the long haul . So , I called Sony . I talked to someone for about 10 minutes after spending a few minutes talking to an automated voice which attempted to help me with my computer problem unsuccessfully and then spending 10 minutes on hold . I naturally didn't get anywhere . He then told me to call the " returns " department . Of course , the number I called wasn't the returns department . I talked with them for a while and realized they were not able to help . I explained that as a consumer of a Sony product - that I did believe that they would want to satisfy me . By the way , I thought I had just received a lemon and bought the same drive at Best Buy - only to find out that it had the same problem . Best Buy gave me a full refund though . Again , the representative at Sony said that I should call the " returns " department . So I was given another number and called them . I did manage to stay cool , calm and collected throughout this process even though I had been on the phone for about 45 minutes by this point . I talked to another person and seemed to be getting nowhere - so I asked if there was a " returns " department at Sony - her answer " NO " . Well , at least she was able to tell me that . So again I went through my spiel to guilt her - kindly - into thinking that I should be able to get some satisfaction from Sony and that I shouldn't just be out $ 100 . She agreed and compiled with my request to transfer me to a supervisor . Interestingly enough I was transfered to the very same person I started with . I spoke to him for another 10 minutes - he agreed to transfer me to a supervisor - at least I had advanced to having them transfer me instead of me calling a different number every 10 minutes . I started speaking to a " supervisor " - he told me that he couldn't help me that he didn't deal with peripherals like DVD 's and that I would have to call someone else . I asked him if he was a supervisor and he said " NO " . Another no - two in a matter of over an hour . These people are good . They avoid the word " NO " whenever possible and just keep transferring - and they do stay calm and somewhat polite - even though you get the impression they aren't listening most of the time . That is at least more than I can say for MWave . com personnel who are insolent and rude before they get on the phone . Anyway , before being transferred again I asked this last guy at Sony if he would recommend that I just suck it up and face the fact that I was not going to get my money back - he said that I would probably not get a refund but that he really couldn't help me because he didn't work in the peripherals section of sony .. Well , my last recourse is to ask for a charge back from American Express on my purchase . Hope that works . The point of all this is to let everyone know that SONY is selling defective drives . Read some of the other reviews on Amazon - I sure wish I had before I thought to purchase a Sony drive . And if Amazon or any other reseller doesn't give you your money back then don't bother even contacting Sony . Go straight for the charge back option or just suck it up and face the fact that you just lost your money . I am having a hard time realizing that Sony is not only not standing behind its product but that nobody seems to care that I am an unsatisfied customer and that that fact alone is going to hurt future business .  
  My card worked with XP by its support for it was scarce to say the least . Range is bad , and the prove is that Linksys has released a 2.5 version of this card with the new feature of ' extended range ' . Look somewhere else .  
  A nice looking unit , sounds fine , even has good stereo imaging if you are sitting within three feet of the unit , as reccommended in the manual . But the remote would do absolutely nothing towards controlling my Ipod . It would not change songs , forwards or back , would not pause , and did not turn the Ipod off when it turned off the iM600 . Nothing in the manual addressed whether or not the remote was intended to do these functions . But if not , why would they refer to it as a full-function remote ? Is that why they say to sit within three feet , to reach the Ipod ? I returned it to Future Shop the next day .  
  I have owned this piece since it came out in 2005 . I bought it with the Toshiba 52HM84 HD Television . I have owned Toshiba products for 20 years and have never been so disappointed in a products performance and the company 's support of it . The player freezes almost every time you insert a disc . The remote and manual buttons on the front of the unit are of no use . The entire unit decides when it is going to unfreeze . You cannot even turn it off and back on . Toshiba offers no firmware upgrade or useful information to help the problem . They can only tell you to unplug it , take the batteries out of the remote and press every button . This all does nothing to remedy the problem . It sure would be nice if Toshiba would fix the problem . When it does work , it has a great picture .  
  I am bitterly disappointed with the Philips DVDR-3400 recorder , and suppose that all of its line has the same problems . I did not find out until I had burned 300 + DVDs that the disk directory structure created by these Phillips machines is defective . The main title on the disk you make will appear to " play " on your home DVD player .. but ALL of the post-recording edits made ( cutting out parts you didn't want etc . ) are LOST . AND most PC-based DVD players and other software won't handle the disk , so if you wrote your home movies to disk for long-term archiving , you 're out of luck . I don't know how a company the size of Phillips can release such a piece of crap . They HAD to know of these problems . I am sick to think of the time I have lost . All I have is junk to show for it . And yes , I did everything right ( finalizing the disks etc ) . Add to this the terrible remote control with rubbery , no-feedback keys that often don't work ; little provision for using the deck for playback , etc . etc . ( read other 's complaints ) and you have a real loser here . I bought my first Phillips tape recorder in 1968 . I will never buy another Phillips product .  
  Got the pack for my HP Jornada 548 . It is basically a peel-and-stick film . Firstly , its size is less than Jornada 's screen - about 1 to 1.5 mm on each side . Secondly , the film has some sticky residue that was left on the screen after I removed it . I like the idea of a sticker as opposed to original HP 's " clip-ins , " but it could be worked better . When returned to Amazon , I was warned I 'd be charged return shipping costs because " item did not fit my equipment " was my fault ( ! ? ) . Not a biggie , but description could be clearer to avoid similar experiences . Again , my experience applies to Jornada 520/540 series PDAs .  
  I 'm sorry but this is not what we ordered . We wanted a bluetooth Gps and it was worded that way but when this came it worked fine except for there was nothing to connect with my cell phone . The law in N.J. states no cell phonesm , and unless we use " handsfree " , we would be in danger of getting a ticket , if caught talking on a cell phone . We found out we would need to subscribe for the added luxury , which would cost a monthly fee , so we returned the item and look for some other GPS .  
  I bought this accessory when I was new to photography ( 4-yrs ago ) thinking I was getting a good deal , but boy was I wrong ! This lens in not sharp at all , at any zoom level ! Focus is ok in super bright daylight , but is not sharp anywhere ! This has to be the worst lens I have ever owned ! I bought it , used it , and sold it within a week !  
  didn't fit my vision : m . it was slightly too large . the product manufacturer was fosmon . waiting to hear back from the seller ( sf planet ) . the price was good ( 79 cents ) , but not worth it if it doesn't work . so beware - this might not work for you . i would have given it zero stars but i had to give it at least one . i will update the review as the saga unfolds .  
  I brought it home from Best Buy and unpacked it . I tested two different VHS tapes and with both it was very noisy to an annoying level . The DVD player seemed to function ok . Nevertheless , this unit is going back to the store tomorrow . On a side note , all you get in the package is composite cables , which defeats the purpose of buying " a high quality " DVD player . It sure would have been nice to include component cables at least . Keys have also a cheap feel to them but most of us use the remote anyway .  
  I am on my third pair - yes that 's right - my third ! While the head phones are good when they are working and while the company has replaced them at no charge ( shipping to the company was out of my pocket ) , they . all stopped working within months of receipt . I don't abuse them , I used them about 2 hours a day , they are not near water , they were not stepped on , nothing , not even a torn wire cover , not even a scratch . It was the same problem each time - I couldn't hear out of one earbud . I refuse to continue to use their product . They will not offer a credit or an exchange for something better . I have decided to buy a Sennheiser , which I was originally looking to buy but it was not available .  
  The FM reception on the new model ( SRF-M85V ) of the Sony Sports Walkman is horrible . I 've gone through at least 5 or 6 of the old model ( SRF-M80V ) and never had a problem with the reception . I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone .  
  I bought this player at July 2003 , it stops working right before Christmas . When I finally got connected to the APEX customer support ( 1-866-427-3946 and it 's always busy ) , the lady told me it 's a defect on the Laser Pickup and I need to send it in and pay $ 40 labor to fix it .  
  The tech support was prompt and knowledgeable . The unit has good range which seems to be limitied more by the class of the PDA that is trying to acess it . HOWEVER this product has a VERY serious design deficiency that makes it UNSUITABLE FOR USE at any price ! Belkin tech support has confirmed that there is no way to reset the unit to the original factory settings if you can not acess it via the built in web manager . Belkin tech support also confirmed that there is also a flaw in the unit that will cause some user passwords to not be accepted . Once this happens , this will essentially require returning the unit for complete replacement . I know of no other networking product that has such a serious design flaw ( all other networking devices I am aware of have at least a reset button somewhere or a " power on " sequence to handle these inevitable situations ) . It also makes the unit unusable for any scenario where if you make a change to the settings , you can not afford to be without it for the time to swap it out . An obvious problem for you , me and Amazon here !  
  My RX600 LCD went bad after 12 months . Epson would not replace or repair it stating it was just a few days beyond the warranty period . They obviously have a serious problem , and I sure wouldn't mind seeing them take some responisbility . After spending $ 300 for a paperweight and being told by several outsourced Canadian support representatives that I am SOL , I will never sell or purchase another Epson product again . I sure wish someone would setup a class action suit for this issue .  
  I sent numerous E Mails and did not even get one reply from the vendor . I paid for the item but have never recieved it . Very poor show . Will not be giving my money away again . Thanks Eric a PENSIONER .  
  I have had this product for just a couple of days . I am replacing a Microsoft mouse and keyboard because the scroll on the microsoft mouse would quit working hours after inserting the batteries , and you had to press extra hard on the keyboard to get an " n " . So now , I have a mouse that runs through batteries like nobody 's business . I think my new batteries lasted less than 2 days . It also randomly will quit working , but maybe that was because the new batteries were no longer powerful enough , even though the mouse light was as bright as ever . Why would I think it needed new batteries after 2 days ? But at least the scroll works well so far unlike the microsoft mouse , and the keyboard keys seem to work evenly . I do think that it has contributed to locking up my computer as well , though I can't prove it . But I have had several lockups since installing it , and though I get those on occasion , I don't get this many this often . So while it is working it works fine . If you don't mine the batteries and the hassle , I guess it is a cheap way to get a wireless keyboard and mouse .  
  I just bought this printer / scanner today and I am very unhappy with the negative / slide scan capability . The scanner does not scan the entire negative nor the entire slide ! When comparing a print from a scanned negative with a store-produced print , the right most 1/2 inch of the print is simply not there . Same deal with the slide . So this printer / scanner is being returned ! I am now searching for a scanner that will actually scan the entire slide and negative .  
  The Saitek Eclipse II is a fine keyboard .. it has the traditional layout for the cursor keys , which is critical to me , and controllable backlighting with a bit of sidelighting . That 's all good . The feel is a smidge mushy but works well for fast typing . But .. they aren't manufactured reliably . The biggest problem is half the spacebar not working . To fix this , you have to disassemble the keyboard , readjust the rubber membrane under , reassemble and readjust the spacebar springs . Do an internet search on the words " fix saitek eclipse " to get a sense of how common this is . Fixing it takes about 10 minutes , not a killer but kind-of annoying . I 've had this problem with all three Saitek Eclipse IIs I 've had . My only other gripe is that there 's no power key ( for putting the computer to sleep ) on the keyboard .  
  The Casio Exilim I received was broken upon delivery . I was unable to take a single picture and as I had purchased it to take on a cruise and paid extra to have it mailed in two days , it was a complete disaster . To add to the difficulty , when we called the company to return it , they said there would be a 20 % restocking fee . Needless to say , as a person who purchases many items from Amazon , I was terribly disappointed in the purchase and the poor customer service by Expo Electronics . a company that Amazon utilizes as a vendor .  
  The camera takes good photographs . My issue is its recharging system . It was purchased with a cradle CP FX-A10 , after about 9 months the battery would no longer charge fully . I discharged the Nickel Hybride battery fully with no success . I purchased a new battery .. same problems . DO NOT BUY a Cradle , it is a waste of money . I now recharge AA batteries with an external charger .  
  Though all the configurators on the web , including crucial and kingston , say this will work , it does not work on my 700m . It blue screens shortly after start up every time . I will try another brand .  
  The pad is small compared to other heating pads I have had and it does not get hot . The highest setting gets warm at best .  
  It felt better than it looked . I mean it looks like a kids toy , that would break easily . I was totally stoked to have a portable Mp3 player ! 200 + songs on a disk ? Great ! But .. You can't see the display very well , it ate batteries like crazzy , but the Skipping was what made me take it back . 120 seconds ? NO WAY ! how about NO seconds ! Can't walk with it ! Can't use it in the car ! And there is absolutly No Way you can jog or run with it ! Useless ! Picked up a Phillips JogProof . Doesn't play mp3 's but it Does play my CD-R 's and I can Run and Jog and NO SKIPPING ! If you want something to carry , Skip the RioVolt SP90 .  
  I bought these radio 's as an upgrade to the Cobra FRS only that I had before . The range did improve - I have had as much as 2-3 miles car to car on the freeway . But the audio is poor . I normally place the radio in the center console and listen to the conversations from the caravan that I 'm in . The Cobra was very good at this . But even with full volume , the Motorola needs to be held close to my ear and the audio quality is poor . I have used other people 's older model FRS only Motorola 's in the past and they were superior to my Cobra 's . These are not in the same league . The quality is poor enough that I 'm again looking for FRS / GMRS radio 's - NON-Motorola .  
  Up until yesterday this camera has been decent . I found this on clearance on Aug 13 last year at a great price . Since the last Panasonic Lumix I had died just after the year warranty , i figured i didn't want to spend $ 400 for another digital camera since we still love our SLR film camera . We opted for this one . Maybe i am just cursed , but just after one year on this one and poof - no more pictures . The LCD is black except for the on screen display , and I can view pictures in memory . It seems like everything still works , except there is no picture . I don't expect to keep spending decent money on digital camera only to have them break DAYS after the warranty expires . They should not be disposable !  
  Yeah , it 's cute , but it doesn't work too well . The first roll was fine , and thereafter , the film wouldn't load properly . It took 8 + tries to get the film loaded the second time around . In the middle of my third roll , the camera just stopped working . The lens didn't engage after opening the shutter door . I 'm in the process of returning the camera to Cannon , which will take 3 weeks before I see it again . I 'm pretty unhappy with this cutie . If you buy it , get some kind of extended warranty .  
  Product was advertised as new , but the unit that arrived was used . The box was torn and had several prices scratched out and written over . The screen was washed out when playing a DVD . You could not watch a movie on this screen without going blink . Overall it was a piece of junk . Would never buy this item again .  
  This cable is touted , with all it 's high end materials , as something that will bring out the sound of your expensive HiFi components . In reality , this cable is not natural sounding and strips out the midrange inherent in high quality audio equipment which defeats the purpose in my view . The added " clarity " is code for poor sound quality . Even the least inexpensive patch cables I own ( free cables shipped with all new stereo equipment ) sound more natural than this " hi end audiophile " cable . Audioquest cable design engineers are clearly more interested in material design than in enjoying music . I would recommend NXG Sapphire cable instead - it 's sounds much more natural and is 1/3rd the price .  
  I bought this VCR based on the recommendations of other users and review sites . It probably works great for them , but I found it problematic . I own a Harmony Remote . I would give those five stars , but not even a Harmony Remote can compensate for the problems with this VCR . My main frustration stems from their One Touch Recording . This is the feature where you press Record a few times to have it record for 1/2 an hour , 1 hour , or other length of time . On my current RCA vcr , I then turn the VCR off and it continues to record . This is wonderful because my Harmony Remote turns off all my devices at once . If I am recording , I hit Off . If I am not recording , I hit Off . My current RCA VCR handles this fine . Not so with the Panasonic ! Hit off and the recording cancels ! So sorry ! Your recording setup is meaningless ! ( In case you can't tell , I really did not like their method . ) It would have been nice for there to be an option to cancel recording or not . However , I 'm a geek and I like my electronics configurable . My secondary annoyance was with their programmed recording setup . In my current RCA vcr , I type in the numbers . You can't do this with the Panasonic . You must use the arrow keys to scroll through the numbers for date , hour begin , minute begin , hour end , minute end , and recording mode ( SP , SLP ) . It takes three times as long . I also did find the fast forward / rewind annoying as other users have . It is quick , but ends up taking more time than if it was the normal speed of my other VCR.I considered giving this two stars because it has some cool features , such as index search , rapid fast forward / rewind , and tape remaining . But then I called their tech support . Tech support is a big part of any product . If you are having trouble using it , this can make it so much better . In this case , it only made it worse . First I sent an email that was never replied to . Why bother giving that method to contact them if it gets nowhere ? Next I called them and we spent five minutes filling out my contact information - no , it 's spelled R A Y M O N D - to get a simple question answered . Maybe it wasn't such a simple question ; he had to look it up . However , I apparently was expected to know how their One Touch Recording worked prior to purchasing their vcr . Sorry , but number one rule of business is to keep your customer happy . Since I 'm going to have to eat the shipping costs and restocking fee to return this , I 'm not too happy with Panasonic and tech support gave me no reason to be any happier . Perhaps this vcr would work for you , but I found it completely inadequate . I spent extra money to get a better vcr , but $ 40 models I 've had in the past have been better .  
  This was the biggest peice of junk ever ! I am now swearing off Belkin . Pros : Looks cool . Cons : Incompatible with just about every Vista laptop ( tried to install it on 3 ) . Very difficult to install . Support from Belkin is ridiculous . I 'm a programmer & Tech , so I finally got it installed on one of my laptops , the video card never worked . Conclusion : Don't buy this . Research it on the Web 1st . When I purchased it , very few had reviewed it on the Web after purchase , only the main stream media reviewed it and they are too political . Now you will find many bad reviews of this device .  
  The unit did not turn on when connected to the car lighter . After checking on different cars , I concluded that the unit was defective . I returned it and received a new one in a short time . The new one worked fine . In general , the sound is good , although I am able to hear some noise ( little ) when there is a gap between songs .  
  I always use my s700 fuji camera with a 1GB memory , when i use this 2GB memory , stopped to work fine , al pictures blurry , i think .. this is too slow for photos .  
  This battery does not work in my Panasonic Lumix camera . Is it a dud battery or is it because it is not a " Panasonic " brand ? I can't say .  
  i was seceptical about this alarm clock after reading the reviews , but ordered it anyway . i sleep with a sleepmate ( makes white noise ) and needed an alarm clock . i was hopeful that this clock would serve both purposes . after reading the pamphlet for 15 minutes , i can now use the white noise function . i 'm sure that i could figure out the alarm with more reading , but it 's just too complicated as i will only be using this alarm clock at my vacation cottage . by the time i get back to the cottage , i 'll have to read the manual again . so , this is fine for a sleepmate ( white noise machine ) , but i 'll use the alarm on my cell phone . also , i do like how dim the time display gets . this would be great if the alarm were easier to use .  
  Then turned it on today , went right to the formatting HDD display . Tries to format , then says ' formatting is failed . ' So I went to the panasonic web page , and it claims there are no repeat no service centers within 3000 miles of washington dc . how crazy is that ? When it worked , it was great-after trying to figure out the manual that is . update : shipped it off to panasonic service center and got it back within three weeks . now to plug it in .. anyone want to bet on how long it lasts ?  
  Keys are not that smooth . Space bar design is not good .. otherwise a good buy - broke just after 2 months of use  
  The writing was painful , the dialogue abolutely awful , and the plot got " too perfect " after a while . However , the basic premise is wonderful and the idea of all the characters is good . It really could make a wonderful movie - especially now that we all have renewed awareness of the process involved in choosing a new Pope . I 'm guessing most production companies don't want to take a risk on films about religion , which is why Mel Gibson had to finance The Passion of the Christ on his own .  
  I got this for my 13 yo daughter , who really wanted a video camera to play around with . The Aiptek seemed to be perfect ; simple to use and not too expensive . Well it 's not particularily easy to use : The picture was very difficult to get into focus ( manual focus that doesn't seem to make much difference ) . It is faily inexpensive , but you will want to expand the memory ( Compact Flash ) which now is fairly cheap , but you will need several at 64mb . Sound is barely audible . If your budget is tight and this is all you can afford ; wait a year until better products fall into this price range . You will be much happier and won't have to dispose of this unit . Our solution was to buy a well rated low end dvd unit for around $ 400 . This is for the family , but she can use it . She 's happy with the " awsome unit " , and I was able to upgrade from my 8mm unit , so it 's a win-win . ( With her using it , her being a teenager and all , I got an extended , free replacement type warrantee , however . )  
  Disappointed that this bracket could not hold the weight of my Westcott 5 in 1 40 " reflector . I had to crank the handle down so tight that it broke . I 'm sure it would work fine for small , lightweight reflectors but look for something more solid or with a metal ball and socket clamp if you are working with larger reflectors .  
  Doesn't work . It 's not sensitive enough to work with a low wattage tuner that draws about 15 watts when on and 2 watts when off . Can be set to turn on the controlled outlets , but will not turn them off . If sensitivity is adjusted to turn them off , it will not turn them back on .  
  When I bought this camera , I was rather impressed by its monster two inch screen . The menu is impressive , but badly animated . The movie-making feature is probably the best feature . The Casing is lightweight and nicely shaped . The shutter works at awesome speeds . The battery is everlasting . However , this " camera " fails to do one thing ( which I think cameras should be able to do ) . And this is taking good pictures . I mean , for god 's sake ! Even my dad 's cranky 4 year old 2.1 megapixel canon takes better pictures ! I am considering going right back to the shop and trading it in for a canon . 4 years it has been since the first 2.0 megapixel digital cameras came out . And what has happened ? They have got worse ( Casio 's at least ) . The pictures come out with really bad quality pixels . Sometimes the picture can come out really blurred . As for the two inch screen , its absolute rubbish . Canon has got much better screens . No offence to Casio , they make things that people usually want , but they just don't have a clue about making cameras . They should stick to making watches . So all in all guys , do your research , and make your own evaluations . I only wrote this to help you make the right choice ( Canon ) . But from my point of view if you want to take good and high quality pictures , this camera is a no-goer . cheers , and good luck  
  Our company bought two of this model in 2005 for our new branch office . After we set them up , it works just fine . We didn't use any of the advanced features at that time . After reading the user 's guide and online forum at the Linksys web site , we found out that there are a battery inside the router that is NOT user replaceable . You need to send it in for replacement . Sure enough , we now have two routers that can't retain any configuration settings . They all reset to factary default all of a sudden , one after 1 year , the other after 1 and half year . Also note , we updated one of the router to newest firmware , which prevents any kind of connection from the internet . Needless to say , my boss is really crossed with me because I was the one recommend the model .  
  We bought and enjoyed using this player back when the price was $ 350 or so ( 2008 ) ? It played standard , Hi Dev and first generation blu-ray DVDs with no problem . Yes , it was agonizingly slow to power up , load and remote through settings , but it played everything we through at it . But when the technology in Blu Ray advanced , this unit became outdated . I finally went to the Samsung site and upgraded the firmware via LAN method . That was pretty straight forward . But now the player will not function . The final step indicates to power up and confirm the upgrade took . Player display on power up indicated " CD UP " . I waited 30 minutes and had to physically unplug the player to get it to power up . Flat panel indicates no signal . At this point I did a search and found this thread , which indicates this is a known bug and Samsung apparently has no remedy short of making a repair . Even that may not work [ .. ] Summary : If you are content to not play the newer generation Blu Ray DVDs , then this player would work - we got 5 good years out of it but ultimately the firmware upgrade failed .  
  Well I got my switch over the weekend and did not work as advertised , it does not switch automatically as it should . I got 3 HDMI devices connected to the switch and the only way I can get it to switch is to disconnect the HDMI cable fromt the back of the switch , hardly what I had intended to do in the first place . I do not have any audio or video problems otherwise I will have it return ASAP . Manual mode works that is why I gave it another star , otherwise it would have been one . If you want a manual switch with some pretty lights , this one is for you . I may add that I tried every suggestion that I read with same results , only pulling the cable or turning the device off from the wall seems to work . Poor product .  
  Sent back and bought a Case brand . Will only hold a 15 & # 34 ; or smaller . Good back pack otherwise , if you need smaller one .  
  The description is wrong for other printers / mfc as well . The Brother website lists ONLY the following printers as compatible : FAX1840C , FAX1940CN , FAX2440C , MFC3240C , MFC3340CN , MFC5440CN , MFC5840CN  
  The T029201 was received promptly , but the ink was completely dried , and we were unable to use it at all , forcing us to purchase another cartridge from another company .  
  DO NOT GET THIS WOOFER ! I REPEAT DO NOT GET THIS WOOFER ! After reading numerous reviews for this product there seemed to be quite a few reports of the woofer blowing below its rated power , but I took the risk and got it anyway : First impressions : not very loud , didnt hit very lowImpressions one week later : still sounds like crap . My amp puts out 460watts rms and 800 peak , which is under this woofers rating . One day I 'm driving along and the voice coil welds itself solid , filling the enclosure with smoke . Just look at the magnet on this thing , it 's clearly not big enough to be handling 500 watts rms . I replaecd it with an Infinty Kappa Perfect 12vq . It 's only rated at 400rms but is 10x louder , 10x cleaner , and hits 10x lowe than this POS ever did .  
  way to heavy to haul to europe and does not even help with US hair dryer or curling iron , we brought to Russia , and threw in the trash and left in Russia , what a pain it weights like 50lb . , would not recommend , security even stopped us , not a good deal to bring .  
  Nice router , easy to install on MS Windows . I 'm only giving it 2 stars however . Linksys won't support Linux , and their cards ( WMP11 PCI card ) has absolutely no support for Linux . It used to , then they changed the chipset and the drivers that the community wrote don't work anymore . If you 're looking to WiFi your Linux box , buy Lucent or D-Link  
  This seems like a great way to go , but it 's awful . Truly awful . It 's good if you want to back up a few files and don't plan to read / write to the drive very often . But if you plan to use it as a small shared data server ( which is what 's it 's supposedly designed for ) , don't waste your time or money . The software is problematic . The drive crashes easily and needs constant attention . And the service was ridiculously bad . Maxtor basically told me to take a hike when I called after the latest crash .  
  HEWLETT-PACKARD DB946A Notebook Computer BatteryThis battery doesn't charge properly , .. Even though the charge level indicator indicates full charge , the charge doesn't last more than half hour when the computer in running .  
  WOW , they really do hurt . I had to put socks on the earpieces to not hurt my ears so bad ! I was very disappointed with the quality of the reception . If you live in an apartment complex , I would strongly advise not buying these . There is way too much interception . It is very hard to get ( and keep ) a good signal .  
  I just wanted to extend my utter frustration with the RV0041 router . I spent more than $ 250 for this router , thinking it would be all I ever needed . Only a few months after owning it , the already LOUD internal fan started sounding like a jet engine . I contacted Linksys support and was sent a replacement through the RMA process . The unit I received worked for about a month or so now without a problem until now . It has started sounding like the other one . What piece of junk fans did they put in these things ? I am getting rid of this and going with another brand . Now I am out $ 254 , and I have to go spend money on a router .  
  I 'm not dissapointed with product but with the seller that is telling people that works for Iphone , IT DOESN'T . So don't waste your money if you want it for your Iphone .

  Who would I recommend this product to ? Windows 98 users who won't be upgrading to ME . The product will not work with Windows ME , period . I called tech support , there was nothing they could do . There are NO drivers available for this product on Windows ME . If you trying installing the drivers , it will freeze your pc every time you turn on your dv camcorder . I recommend Windows ME users do NOT buy this device , as D-LINK corp obviously DOES NOT care at all about their customers using a more recent version of Windows . I certainly thought I was getting a bargain deal when buying this from Amazon . Com . Boy was I wrong !  
  i get disconnected at least 3 or 4 times a day using these linksys wireless routers . Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink . At best , each time i get disconnected i have to restart my pc and the router and wait 10 minutes to get back online again . if you 're doing something important , forget it !  
  Retractable handle not attached to the bag very well . Looks like it will break easily . The rest of the bag is well designed , fits two 17in laptops perfect .  
  Received this as a gift , and after a year and a couple thousand pictures , the card just failed on me ( 16gb transcend sdhc class 6 ) . I put the card into our computer to offload the latest pictures , and it started showing extra directories and files with scrambled names . I proceeded to quickly get the most recent pictures transferred , but then things took a further turn for the worse as I was trying to delete the extra scrambled files . A series of cryptic error messages came up , and now neither the computer nor the camera will even recognize the card as valid anymore . Bugger . I feel lucky that this failure happened after I got our pictures off of it . Thank goodness this didn't happen when we were on vacation . All brands fail , but I 'll probably go with one of the better known brands when I get a replacement .  
  I tried to connect my printer to the USB port in my Apple AirPort . The printer would not connect . I tried a Tripp Lite cable P / N U026-016 and the printer started working perfectly . I swapped back this the Belkin cable and the printer did not work . Went back to the Tripp Lite cable , the printer started working again , so I left everything alone . Would not recommend this cable .  
  AFTER SPENDING $ 500 BUCKS MY CAMERA STRAP CAME OFF AND THE ZOOM MOTOR BUSTED ! I found out through the camera guy at Costco that they stopped selling them because " THEY R JUNK " IM NOT KIDDING THAT IS WHAT HE SAID . Now I don't agree but you get so much more from the 707 because it has biult in MEMORY ! as well as plenty of zoom , it is so much more durrable to ( hard metal ! not plastic shell ) I picked one up in the box and I am verry happy w / the results I get from the H.P. 707 .. BOTTOM LINE the 945 looks so much more like an s . l . r . but it 's too bulky and cumbersome .. the 707 fits in your pocket too and so you don't have to lugg it around your neck lookin like a TOURIST !  
  We bought the Brother 7820N MFC in late , 2006 . It was an excellently priced MFC ( laser ) for what you get . It worked wonderfully for about 8 months . We didn't print super heavy on it ( I would guess 50 pages per month or so ) Then , it stopped working altogether . It just would not print . Luckily , we had purchased the 3 year warranty from Staples for $ 75.00 or $ 99.00 ( can't remember ) . I called Staples and they told me that since I was within the first 12 months , I needed to call Brother for the warranty . I called brother , which was very hard to do , to actually get through and talk to a person . The tech rep seemed like he was having a terrible day because he seemed like my call of just wanting to know how to maybe try and fix or troubleshoot the printer set him off . It is hard to troubleshoot on the phone with someone who acts as if the last thing they feel like doing is helping you . None of the troubleshooting worked . It took them several months to actually ship us a new machine . When we got the new machine it didn't even power up . My wife and I were laughing at the absurdity of it , even though it was agrevating , as we had spent $ 400 on this machine ( after adding in the extended warranty ) . By the time we had gotten the second machine that didn't work , it was past the 12 month period . So now we called staples and they apologized . They sent us a new machine which we received about a month ago . It does work , but every time it prints , it makes grinding noises on the left side toward the back . It will only print if we hold in or bang on the side of the machine and then the grind stops and it prints . Again , we are laughing at the seemingly cheap construction . Now , since this is our third machine , Brother won't do anything and staples will not replace the machine either . Staples will give us a credit toward another printer for $ 170.00 . At least they are doing SOMETHING , however , we paid $ 400.00 for a printer for 8 months of use . It could be worse , but we will definately NOT be buying another BROTHER . At least we get the 170.00 from staples . We are going to try an HP . The reason we bought this printer was due to the excellent reviews . I have become more suspicious of the online reviews of products . I think it is fishy that there are so many excellent reviews of this product and yet 3 of our models ended up not working ( granted , the first one DID last for 8 months and worked great ) . I think that a lot of the reviews come from the company themselves , and I would be willing to bet that many employees are encouraged to get on the site and build the reviews up . I only say that because this is the first time I have ever given a reciew of a product . People are busy and I find it a little hard to believe that so many people get online and post how wonderful their brother printer is . I can understand when people have bad experiences ( like me ) that they might get on to post a review . I think it probably boils down to ( to a great extent ) that you get what you pay for . Brother appeals to low initial cost consumers , without much regard for long term quality , reliability , durability , customer service . I once heard someone say that when trying to decide on which product / service to purchase , they never go with the lowest bid because they can't afford to . That seems the case here too .  
  This was exciting . The retractable cord albeit a little short to hit your nightstand from most wall outlet locations in hotels has a great retracting spring to help you wrap things up quickly . However , the AC adapter i received must be faulty . I plugged in overnight , and while it showed : Charging " it didnt actually charge . I tried in 2 hotels and 3 airports , all the same . I kept it anyways simply because i liked the retractable USB dongle and I used an apple charger with it , but overall it just didnt work for me . Cable , while cheap and i doubt it would last daily use , works for now . AC adapter , nope . DC adapter . Psh , who needs this ? Thrown in for the sake of having it . Very few do not have an ipod adapter in car already , and if youre buying this to be used in car , dont . thin cables just arent good for being repeatedly pinched and abused in a car enviroment  
  This cable is defective at connecting a Nikon P7000 to a computer . A UC-E6 is supposed to be able to do this . When the OEM Nikon cable is used it works fine and the P7000 is recognized as a portable device . When the aftermarket cable is used there is a " device driver " error . " And " device unplugged " notice . " Jiggling " the connectors doesn't help . The cable is USB A on one end and a custom connector on the other end . Upon receipt I noticed that there was excessive nylon moulding on the USB A end blocking the conductors . I removed this with a razor blade . This did not help . I used a multimeter and optical microscope to check whether the wires are paired correctly to the cable ends . The four pins on each end are correct , with the following signal lines the same for both the Nikon and aftermarket : 1-1 , 2-2 , 3-4 , 4-3 , and ground shell . In order to determine whether the problem was at the USB A end or the custom end , I connected a USB A extension cord with known good ends . All four signal lines work correctly with the multimeter . When this was connected , the computer still refused to recognize the camera . Thus the problem is in the small end , not the USB A end . The small end shows no obvious problems , and thus there is no simple fix that can be performed that can make it work correctly . It can be noted the aftermarket small connector is generic , and has 8 conductors . The OEM Nikon connector is special , and has 5 conductors molded into the shell with 3 spaces occluded .  
  I 've had this printer for a little more than 2 years now . I almost immediately regretted buying it . Epson has had to send me a new printer 2 times . Each time they had the same issue . I would send back the one I have now ( the 3rd one ) but my warranty has expired . If I want to make a color print it takes 2 or 3 tries to get one that doesn't have random black ink spots on it . When you are printing 11x17 " photos it gets very expensive very quickly . The ink doesn't last long to begin with but when you consider how many times I have to try to get a usable print its ridiculous . I 've had that problem with all 3 of my printers so it seems to be a defect in the design of the printer . The paper does not feed through the machine correctly . It 's gotten to the point where the printer is basically unusable , even to print a white page with only black ink . Don't waste your money . The printer is expensive to begin with and the ink costs about $ 120 per refill . When you factor in the cost and that you have to try 2 or 3 times to get a usable print you are better off going to a professional print shop .  
  i purchased a iRiver 790 for my girlfriend and a Rio Forge 256 for myself . boy do i wish i had ordered the iRiver for myself . not only did her player cost less , it sounds better and works flawlessly . the only thing better about my forge is the armband . i hate to say this , but i 've been happier with my cheapo irock ! 520 ( bought used ) . sigh . okay , here we go : first of all , i spent the extra $ to get the 256MB player because i wanted to be able to record clips from the radio . only problem is that the radio doesn't work . period . second , the darn thing has problems turning itself on . sometimes it takes 2 or 3 tries before it stays on . i called customer support and the only thing they could tell me was that i needed to update the firmware . by the way , that did not fix the problem . third of all , the player isn't designed terribly well . the battery cover is difficult to get off , and the plastic tabs that hold it shut aren't terribly sturdy and are already showing wear .  
  I ordered two power cables and what I got were to photo transfer cables of which I now have 4 . It was a total royal screw up thank you very much .  
  Be careful if ordering the advertised Tripp Lite U022-010 USB2.0 Certified Gold A / B Device Cable - 10ft from ClearAV . That is certainly NOT what they sent to me . They are aware of the mistake in the listing but never contacted me before shipping my order to let me know that wasn't what I was getting .  
  Nice lens , but the glass rattles too much within the frame and is really quite annoying .  
  This is the worst camera I 've ever owned . Picture quality is average , however I have to replace the batteries everytime I use the camera . I purchased the recommended batteries which gave even worse results than standard AA 's . After taking a few pictures the camera will " hang " on a pic . and destroy the image . Customer service offered no help unless I wanted to pay them to inspect the camera for problems .  
  This product was awful . It provided horrible quality sound , horrilbe quality usage on voice activation , and an all around bad experience .  
  I bought this controller because it was on sale for $ 45.00 and for THAT price it is an acceptable mouse . It is comfortable and does what I as a web surfer need for it to do . HOWEVER the freaking battery issue is B.S. Changing the battery at least once a day is pain especially if the dead battery doesn't get placed back in the charger correctly and leaves you hanging when it is needed . I saw all the complaints about this before I bought this mouse and thought to myself that changing the battery often would be no big deal . I 'm here to tell you - IT GETS OLD IN A HURRY . Bottom line is LogiTech is capable of much better products than this and you would be better off avoiding this mouse at any price .  
  I bought this sound card with the Razer gaming headphones . When everything is working the sound is phenomenal . Unfortunately , I am mostly stuck with only the center channel working when I use the headphones , and when I use speakers I often have random channels cutting in and out for no reason . This really could be a killer sound card , but Razer needs to work out the bugs first .  
  Yeah , 8 seconds , then a pop and nothing . You wouldn't think it would be hard to connect a wire between two points , but I guess it is . Since my home theater is now apart waiting for this cable , I guess I 'm off to a brick and mortar store .  
  I got a rechargeable with camera and it becomes low after a few picture 's . I went out and bought batteries at Radio Shack ( lithium ) which are working great ! Now I see other 's are having the same problem I was , so .. I 'll stick to the lithium .  
  I got this in April 2007 for use with my iPod 5.5 ( 80 GB model ) . It doesn't work at all-won't charge the iPod . For me , it was a waste of money , but it would cost more to return it than I 'd get back . Susan K  
  Wish that I had checked these out at Amazon before I bought them elsewhere . Extremely lo-fi , popped , noisy , spent several hours moving the base and tuning them , got the sound quality all the way up to pretty poor . I never return anything , but these went back , I am here looking for some headphones with a cord . ( Tried to edit the above , but could not without redoing it , forgot to metion flimsy feel and poor fit . ) Remember when Sony was a name you could be sure of ? I 'm not sure anymore . Buy something else and save yourself some time and trouble .  
  The selling point of this product is that it 's small and it can be carried in a key chain . If one will do so , the loop will brake ( mine did broke in a month and I lost it ) . I consider this product as a failure ! Next time try to change that loop , other then it will , can , be the finest product of its kind .  
  This item was ordered 8/3/2002 and still have not received this item as of 8/27/2002 . NOW they tell me it is on a first order basis ! So how far down on the list am I ?  
  Tried to use it on my xbox 630 . It reported the data loss is too high and won't use it . Tried to do a console system upgrade , downloading files to the Centon , and nearly bricked the console . Don't let this Centon POS anywhere near an xbox 360 . Maybe it will work better on a PC , but why take the risk ? I might RMA it but from reading these reviews the problems appears to be terminal . Drop it in the trash now and be thankful you didn't lose any data later .  
  Ordered this keyboard for my Mac Book Pro so that I could lift the screen to be eye level for working all day . I thought that this would be like and sound like my regular keyboard on my Mac but it 's to clicky and noisy and since i type all day , it would drive me and everyone in the office crazy . I am returning it and will have to do this in person , not online to get the one I want . I like the quiet of the Mac keyboards and I am bummed , it seemed like a great keyboard .  
  This was sent to my granddaughter and she indicated that it arrived , but there was NO GLUE in the pen . Trying to send it back is kind of impossible as she lives in another town and is getting ready to move to Virginia where her husband will be based at Fort Lee ..  
  This product worked great for 5 months . The the power connector between my laptop and the cooling pad became looser and looser . Now I just have a laptop pad . One end of the power connector plugs into a usb port . This end works great . The other end plugs into the cooling pad . This end is very poorly designed , and Antec should be ashamed of themselves for continuing to produce such a poorly designed product .  
  You can Google any of these Panasonic DVD players and it appears they will all do the same as mine did with this model . Work at most 18 months and then give you a NoRead signal which you can't fix . I only played about 18 DVDs on this !  
  This cheap piece of plastic broke within 2 months of me owning it ! Buyer beware !  
  I usually follow Consumer Report in everything I buy but decided to go off the beaten track this one time as I thought their choices were out-dated . I should have gone with their reviews . Maybe I don't know how to use this but I have never taken so many blurry pictures in my life . I have considered getting my old film camera out and using that again instead . I tried to take several pictures of my son goign down a little hill on his sled but none turned out , all blurry and / or too dark . I was very disappointed as we were visiting grandma and we don't get snow where we live so this was a one-time opporuntiy . I like being able to carry it in my purase at all times to take last minute shots but what good is it if they don't turn out . I 'm constantly correcting them in Photo Shop and there is only so far you can go before they start looking grainy . Anyway had I not waited a year to really try it out I would have returned it and checked with Consumer Report to see what would be a good buy . I still may just give this to my 4-yr old son and get a better camera for me . We didn't get nearly as many good shots on our Disney vacation as I would have like . Like one other reviewer said it takes too long for the photo to take and you miss alot when you 're taking pictures of children .  
  I bought this and the audio sucks . It crackles and no matter what you do to try and fix it , it won't . As another review stated , the audio does not lock so that may be why it also crackles as it cannot stay in sync withe the video . I am throwing it away and buying the Canopus 110 . For my MAC , I have used the El Gato USB 2 . o capture device and it always works well , never a problem . The only thing about these cheaper devices is that they have no external control over the contrast , brightness , color , etc and you have to fix any issues in a software program like Final Cut or Adobe premiere . Also , don't buy the crappy EASY CAP , it should be called the EASY CRAP .  
  Three of us had to huddle very close to the speaker to be heard by the folks on the conference call . Not even close to an excellent product .  
  Should have known for the price and size that it would not stand up very well . The slightest breeze sends it toppling over , potentially damaging your camera .  
  I bought this scanner shortly before Christmas in haste based on recommendations that the image quality would be excellent . I installed it shortly after Christmas after purchasing a separate USB cable , because the one included was too short , and downloading Win / XP software , because the included software was marginally XP-compatible . Once I got everything installed , the frustration increased . I can't scan to copy ( my main use for a scanner ) because that utility is incompatible with my HP Photosmart printer . I can't scan to fax since no such utility is available . Scanning to files is very slow and noisy , and directions for adjusting resolution , etc . are totally inconsistent with actual operation . The OCR package lacks much-needed flexibility . Contacting Tech Support at Epson and the software company , NewSoft , has been completely useless . As an Engineering executive , I do a great deal of work with computers , and this is clearly the worst software I 've ever seen . If it 's too late to return this scanner , I 'll donate it to a school as a charitable contribution ( and hope that the school accepts it ) . In any case , I 'll do more research and get a scanner from another manufacturer . Further , I 'll never buy any Epson product again . By the way , the one star rating is one too many .  
  Absolutely , positively , does not work . Should be taken off the market . I rubbed and rubbed , and dropped and dropped , and shaked and shaked for over an hour . I followed the instructions to a T and it did nothing on my 4g iphone . Not even on the slightest scratches came out so forget about anything you can feel with your fingernail . Plain and simple , if the product worked , the idrops website should show an example of it working on real scratches on real products in a video . I actually woke up with a sore hand and shoulder .  
  I used this thing 3 times and by the 3rd time , EVERYONE in the house caught a cold . The filter , apperently , hoards germs .  
  I bought this lens a couple of months ago , and REALLY enjoyed it for about 2 months . The pictures were great , the bokeh effect was perfect and just what I needed . Sadly , the joy didnt last long . I had my camera with my 35mm lens inside my lowepro case and it fell from my knees ( i was sitting in a rest ) , it wasn't a hard fall or anything but my lens was stuck and would not focus . I got it fixed for 40 dollars ( I dont live in the US ) , picked it up a saturday and went on Sunday to my aunts cottage .. Put my camera ( in its case ) on a chair and about 2 min later the damn thing fell AGAIN , the distance was the same .. from the chair to the ground , and again , my lens is stuck and impossible to focus . I havent sent it to get fixed again , its so weak its just very frustrating to have to pay another 40 dollars . Im trying to save up for a better lens , any recomendations ? I need it mainly for portraits and would like for it to be f2.8 or less . Thanks ! ( I have a Canon 60D so the 50mm 1.4 I feel might have way too much zoom )  
  It really is hard to beat the price of this product , and I have been using mine for over a year without too many problems , but there are some problems for which a good price cannot compensate . Reliability is very important to me in determining the value of any recording device , and this one is not very trustworthy . Recording stops if there is dust on the lens ( you won't know until after recording starts , so if you 're expecting to come home and watch the show you missed , guess what ? ) , if it thinks the dvd-r is dirty , or if it 's just not feeling up to snuff that day . Picture quality is key . The D-KR2 is okay over a composite connection , but it is red and green and that 's pretty much it over a component cable . At least that 's how it looks on my lcd tv . Maybe it 's okay on something else . You can't just make extra copies of your home movies or edit them on your computer . This puppy copy-protects your memories . I 'm not kidding . So don't toss those Hi-8 's . You will need them again the next time you want to make a dvd from the content . I 've ordered another dvd-recorder with a hard disk drive . It may not be much better than this , but at least once I load my home movies , I can burn an extra copy for my Mom . It 's her family , too , after all .  
  I bought this unit in August 2003 . I take very good care of my things and I am very delicate with electronics and never really had a problem with them until I got the PDV-0700 . I used it a few hours per week unitl October when all of a sudden , it would not play DVDs anymore . The screen would go half black half white every time it would be turned on . Lucky for me the warranty at that point covered the repair . They had to change the screen . Then it was good for another few months , until the new screen stopped working too . I am very disappointed . I payed hard earned money for a unit I was able to use for less than a year . I decided to go and buy a higher quality , more expansive unit from a more established brand in the dvd player market . I now wish I had done this from the start .  
  I have always used sandisk CF cards . I bought this for my new Canon 40D and right away I started to see that one out of every 100 images was corrupted . First I thought it was the new camera but soon the camera started to freeze on me when in continuous shooting mode . I thought I might have a bad copy of the 40D ! Did some research and found that the same issue was faced by others and the issue was the card and not the camera . I replaced it with an EXTREME II 4GB card and i have not seen the problem since even in continuous shooting mode . I 'd recommend sticking with EXTREME II series for now !  
  The adapter worked out of the box , then suddenly failed less than two months after purchase . You get what you pay for .  
  this piece of junk failed after not much use . No computer can recongnize the device . I will stay away from WD products .  
  I really liked the performance of this unit until it just stopped working after about two years . Of course , the pathetically short one-year warranty had expired .. that 's " Sony quality " for you . Reading reviews from other sites , it seems I am not the only one with this problem .  
  The cradle does NOT fix a second generation iPod nano . I bought this for my brand new 8GB black ipod nano , and the curves on the base of the dock keep the nano from seating firmly . Every time I go over a bump , the ipod gets disconnected and stops playing .  
  Bought one for the office on December 05 . It does not work . Well , it does , but it goes on and off , dropping the conecction very offen . Users are complaining about the extra time it takes them to finish their job on the network . So I will have to buy another brand , as suggested by our IT advisor . I lost my money on this one .  
  This product was great at first , it worked despite the bad reviews I had read and was worth the money . After a few weeks , the charger started making a clicking sound as it was charging , and the red light on it would blink , all at random intervals . I didn't think much of it at first , then it stopped working all together . Being an electronically minded fellow , I opened it up , only to discover that a wire attached from the circuit board to the outlet prong was disconnected . Thus , the clicking sound was 120V AC 60Hz arcing across inside the charger . This thing is not worth the danger or risk of not working . In the long run , a more expensive style will be much better .  
  I bought this player at Best Buy a couple months ago . The player skips on DVDs that have no visible scratches . Half of the time you stick a DVD in the player , it gets stuck trying to load it , and you have to eject the DVD and put it back in for the player to actually read it . Some DVDs it simply won't read at all , and I have to play them in my computer . It is the worst DVD player I have ever used .  
  Having a USB connection and easily hooking up to my computer , I TOTALLY backed up everything on my computer and even made duplicate copies of some large files that I backed up individually as well as part of a system backup . Then , I restored my computer to factory new settings to fix Windows Files problems . Getting all of my data back was a breeze with this storage device . It is compact and holds households of file cabinets ! It was a breeze to set up . The only shortcoming is that it is so inconspicuous that I forget to turn it off after use and it runs for a day before I discover it . The software that came didn't want to work on my Windows computer , but no worries as XP has plenty of options .  
  This headphone was recommended by the instructors at an audio workshop I recently attended . They are comfortable-something I 've found lacking in other headphones I 've acquired over time . The sound is excellent for what I am doing-spoken voice .  
  I purchased this case with the intention of using it in a work truck where it is going to inevitably be banged around , dropped , have things placed on it , and experience extremes of temperature . It has held up remarkably well and provided a visually appealing case for CD 's that stands up to punishment . While this isn't a " hard " case made of impermeable plastic it is still sturdy with pockets deep enough to hold both the discs and the booklets without warping . The case retains its shape well , even when full , and even when dropped or otherwise jolted around the inside of a truck . If I have any complaint about this case it is the cover that while stylish does show fingerprints and markings very easily which means that it has to be wiped clean regularly . While it won't hold up to a rainstorm you aren't usually going to be running around in a downpour with your case , and it will withstand a spill from a beverage . It is also slim enough to fit in your center console without taking up too much space or fit between your seat and the console if that is what you require of it to have easy access .  
  The sound is wonderful . Setup is easy . Unfortunately , batterly life is really , really bad . If you charge it and start playing , you may get up to 2 hours of listening time . Unfortunately the battery runs down when you AREN'T listening , too . So , when I listened for an hour and then did not recharge overnight , by the next morning the battery was out . And it does not recharge quickly , it takes 3-4 hours . This has made me disinclined to use it or carry it around - it basically only works if I have JUST recharged it .  
  For the past few years , I have been using Home Plug equipment to interconnect devices that needed wired connections with my wireless router which has the connection to the WAN . I recently bought some Trendnet 500 devices from Amazon ( BTW , don't buy the stuff , it is junk ) , and things started to go south almost immediately . So , I began to realize that I should just bite the bullet and have someone wire my key rooms in my house with CAT6 ( that 's gigabit capable ) wiring . So after a bit of an expense ( but heh , now that it 's done , it 's done ) , I now have all my key rooms wall ports connected to a main switch ( which is a NETGEAR GS108 , but could also have been another GS105 ) . I then connected one of the wireless router 's wired LAN ports via the room 's wall port to the main switch and then hooked up a NETGEAR GS105 in the two of the other rooms to connect my DVRs , BluRay3d players , etc . There was then nothing else to do .. No configuring , nothing . It just immediately switched everything to get to the wireless router so that DHCP could be completed AND each device found the internet with no hassle . As a test of the wiring and switches , I initiated a ftp download of a 500MB movie file from my main desktop hooked into one of the wireless router 's wired LAN ports to my MacBook Pro connected via a LAN cable to one of the rooms ' GS105 ports . I saw the Network Performance meter jump to about 900 ( yes you are reading this correctly ) megabits per second . Absolutely amazing . I should have done all of this sooner . So the net is , these NETGEAR switches are freaking awesome !  
  This stuff is dirt cheap and does a great job . I used it with a new D945GCLF Intel Atom system that I am using as a NAS device and I am happy with it so far .  
  A few things I didn't pick up from the description before I bought it : 1 . This is an IR keyboard so you must have an IR receiver in your PC to use it . 2 . Because it is IR , you can program it to do your TV functions as well ( NICE ! ) 3 . The " track-stick " is kind of a pain , but you get used to it . 4 . The multimedia keys are back-lit , but not the whole keyboard . 5 . Works perfectly with Windows 7 Media CenterOverall , it 's a very good value for the money . I am considering buying a 2nd one just in case these disappear and I need a replacement .  
  Viewfinder blocks the view . Faulty design . Do not buy this . Canon must stop making this camera . Recommendation to amazon to not carry it , as you will surely get customer returns  
  I got this cable to complement my 3m Cables Unlimited HDMI cables , which are not very pliable . It works great and is the equal of any cable they try to sell for an order of magnitude more at Best Buy or other b & m stores .  
  I made a 4 day , 3 night solo hike in Big Bend National Park . This device was far more valuable to me than a compass . Even though it was dropped on the ground , briefly immersed in water and used often , it survived and told me when I was " off trail " and then gave me clear direction and distance to my next goal . I will never again hike without it . In my automobile I find it fascinating and sometimes helpful . On a trip recently during icey road conditions , we were forced to make a detour onto small backroads . During the times when we were off-highway , we knew where we were and the direction in which we needed to go . It was a great gift for me to receive .  
  The screen pulls down and work fine , but when you 're done it stays down . Or acts like it might go up but doesn't . Maybe halfway and goes no further . Or maybe not . I don't need to " learn " how to make it work . It just doesn't . It you buy this , I suggest you plan on leaving it in the down position .  
  Both my wife and I were fairly new to GPS 's before we bought this unit . We first used a friends when we were driving to a concert and were amazed at the technology . Then , she started using handheld GPS 's for her school program and we decided that we wanted to get one for hiking . At first we were looking at fairly cheap ones since we wanted one just for hiking but after I started to look into the technology I decided that it would be best if we got one that was more like an all in one unit . I travel a fair amount for work and we would also like to have a GPS for road trips and vacations . After a couple of weeks I decided on this GPS . Initially I purchased the Legend Cx in Canada to see if I liked this GPS . I bought that one because the Vista Cx wasn't available and because I was just looking to test the GPS to see if I liked it . It worked great so I then returned it and found the Vista Cx on Amazon for $ 50 cheaper than I paid for the Legend Cx . In case you don't know the Vista is the same as the Legend except the Vista has an elctronic compass and barometric altimeter . I think the electronic compass is well worth it but like I said , I paid less for the Vista since I bought it in the US . Electronics are generally 15-20 % more in Canada so if you can get around shipping costs and customs clearance then buying in the US makes sense . Anyways , we bought the Auto Navigation Kit and 2 GB memory card to go along with this and we couldn't be happier . Having this GPS has given us more reason to get out . We have plenty of places to hike where we live but a GPS just seems to add more fun to hiking . I find with geocaching it adds more purpose to your trip and also gives you a sense of accomplishment when you find the geocache . This GPS works great on the road too with the mapping software that comes with the auto kit . I can see the GPS screen just fine on the dash of my car when I 'm driving . I don't think I will ever get lost again as long as I have my GPS with me . Once I set a destination in my GPS it does the rest for me . I find when I 'm travelling I want to drive around and without a GPS you 're kind of stuck staying on the path that you know . With your destination set in your GPS you can take any road you like and it will re-route your trip . If you want a GPS that you can use for everything then I would say this is definitely the one . So far I have no complaints with the unit .  
  Can't imagine people are actually buying this unit when it comes free with the AV420 purchased thru Walmart . com .  
  This charger works well for pretty much everything except for my brother 's cell phone . That 's alright though because I got it so I could charge my MP3 player when I 'm at my friend 's house . It 's small enough that I can carry it with me when I 'm traveling or stay at my friend 's . It 's great for the price and definitely worth buying !  
  This is a nicely designed camera . It 's well balanced in the hand and the features are accessible without searching the menu , which means it 's faster in the field . I resisted the urge to buy more resolution and a hot shoe because the ease of a built-in flash and the high quality of optical zoom is much more practical . Pixels are nothing without optics ! I shoot everything from horses at liberty to paintings for reproduction and so far I 've been delighted with the results . Shooting in a dusty , dark indoor riding arena is the ultimate test . I was pleased with the lack of digital noise . I 've had my Fuji S5200 for a couple of weeks and am very happy with my choice .  
  Can you get a better camera than this one ? For real . Is that camera going to cost you more ? For real . Is the cost difference woth the extra cash ? Not for me . It 's small enough to fit in your pocket and takes good pics . It 's probably not enough for the pros or anything , but I don't think the pros were looking at this camera in the first place .  
  This antenna is a good buy for the money . I have a sharp xlmp131 which had horrible reception for am and fm stations . I bought this product from a local store in town and tried it out . It improved myreception of weak signals and cleared static from my strong ones . It also amplified the am so that i could recieve stations I never used to get ! Pros : Elegant design and superior technologyCons : Wish the cable was longer than about 3ft . But other than that nothing else .  
  Player worked fine for the first 3 months then kept getting " stuck " every few minutes . Took it to authorized Pioneer service facility for warranty repairs where it has remained for the last 7 weeks . Still don't have it back ! Pioneer refuses to provide a replacement unit . With this kind of service , I suggest taking a pass on the Pioneer .  
  I use these cables for my upconverting DVD player as well as my Dish Network system . It works wonderfully on both , and for a fraction of the cost of other options . Get up within a foot or two of the TV ( 50 " Panasonic plasma ) and you can see some issues , but the picture and sound are still dramatically improved and very sharp as compared to any non-HDMI cable . If you are a true A / V addict , perhaps you can tell the difference between this and the Monster cables , but for the less experienced viewer , these get you into an immersive HD experience at an excellent price ! On a shipping note , these arrived extremely quickly , sent via Priority Mail .  
  This is my first digital SLR . I have owned digital point and shoot cameras by Nikon , canon and Pentax . I have owned three different Pentax 35mm SLR cameras and this already out does them all . This review is not written by an expert photographer . I am just writing about what I like and dislike and a few options to add to the camera to help the dislikes . Firstly , you can't beat the download speed and review of all pictures on your computer with a digital camera and the software included . The editing software could be better but you can find better pretty easy online . Secondly , the lens it comes with is good and it works great for day to day use considering you will want others and this one you could bang up a little . If you are looking for a telephoto lens with macro then get the Tamron AF 70-300mm tele-macro on Amazon you can't beat its price and it takes some great shots . The only downfall of the Canon is the EF and EF-S mounts that you can get from a few different retailers that are made for only the newer Canon cameras . The downfall is unlike Pentax and Nikon where you can use almost all of their older SLR lenses for the digital SLR you have to buy new lenses for the canon . But like I stated you can find lenses they are not in short supply . Thirdly , if you know nothing about using SLR this is a great teacher if you have the time to learn . You can change the settings and review the shot so quickly that you can improve quickly . The shooting options are as good as the old Pentax SLRs of the 70s and 80s and as good as the newer Pentax SLRs of the 90 's . The direction book could be a little easier to follow as it makes you jump around a bit instead of flowing from one page to the next . Fourth , you need a tripod as your shots are not going to be as fuzzy as a point and shoot but the case itself feels cheap and fragile in your hands especially if you have big hands . Get the battery grip or a skin , not unlike the ipod rubber skins . Fifth , you can use the battery for about 2 hours straight , and I don't mean turning it on and off taking a shot or two an hour , I mean leaving it on and taking 20-40 multiple shots a minute . I literally took shots in continuous mode for an hour and still had enough battery to use the flash for an hour . I think I came out with 500 to 700 shots before the battery needed to be recharged , which took two hours . :( Get an extra battery or the battery grip with two batteries and optional 6 AA battery cell . Sixth , the LCD screen is huge . It shuts off when you get close to it to save your eye for focusing is low light but turns right back on when you back away and blinds you in the dark . The fix is simple it shuts off , which is cool if you remember and saves the battery . You also can review the picture taken for a few seconds by changing the display time which is nice or you can , like all point and shoots , press the play button and look at each shot . Among the negatives are the cheap feel of the casing and the flash options . The flash is automatic in the green square automatic shot mode , whether you want it or not . On the other hand you have an automatic setting that has the flash off too ; it would be easier and quicker if the flash button changed that instead of dialing it in . On the other hand the " P " setting is versatile . You can shoot in almost any mode like the Automatic , you can change all settings and if you want it to flash you open the flash and if you don't you close it . Anyway have fun with it and upgrade when you learn more in this model .  
  This thing is great and I love it . I listened to it in the store and i was a little questionable but when i brought this sucker home it was a different story ! It knocked my clock down and my parents bedroom is like 4 rooms down and it literally shook their television . no lie , no gimmicks . it sounds clear and crisp with lots of features . this puppy is LOUD ! you can also hook this thing up to a DVD Player or video game . i hooked this thing up to my Xbox and it sounds incredible ! At 330 watts ( 110x2 for Subwoofers and 55x2 for woofers and main speakers ) this thing has deep bass . it can reach down as far as 29Hz without bottoming out . You can hear and even feel the lowest frequencies . Believe me if you dont hear it you will definitely feel it ! < ( there is a slim chance of not hearing it ! ) While you guys are readin this ill be at the NBA All-Star Game Section B Seat 25 !  
  I bought these headphones as a gift for my boyfriend and he LOVES them . He 's been a DJ for 8 years and he 's never owned anything with better sound or comfort . The quality is excellent compared to the flimsy Sony MDR-V700 which break easily . They look great and aren't too heavy . Worth every penny .  
  Purchased 3 of these for use in my embroidery sewing machine . Smaller size was what I needed . All three perform beautifully .  
  A very high quality piece of glass and highly recommended . I 've used several different filter brands over the years ; low to high end . B + W is the way to go for serious protection and filtering with NO degradation of image quality .  
  I bought the battery to replace my old one and once I finally got the Ipod open , the old battery out and the new one in and tried to start up the Ipod nothing happened but I was expecting this because the instructions said it needs to charge . Then I plugged my Ipod in to charge and the Ipod came to life and said the battery was charged but whenever I unplugged the Ipod it would just shut off even after I left it charging for at least six hours . I tried reinstalling it but I still got the same thing . Then I just left the Ipod to charge the rest of the night and most of the day yet when I unplug it it just turns off and I cannot turn it on again unless I charge it . I putted my old battery back in and the Ipod turns on and works just fine . I 'm extremely disappointed with the product and wouldn't recommend it . But to be fair I think it 's just luck of the draw , most of the other reviews on hear have nothing but good things to say about the battery while there are a few who say that the battery didn't even work like mine . I think that there is the off chance that the occasional customer will come across a faulty battery . Like I said , luck of the draw . May the odds ever be in your favor .  
  Purchased this device to replace the memory that came with the original camera , plugged it in , did a format and started taking pictures . Raw pictures seem to write faster and with ease . Now I have the freedom to take multi pictures of the same object and delete the least desirable . Well worth the purchase .  
  Creative has the best products . This holds up , and is a great accessorie to the zen micro and microphoto .  
  needed an external pc card reader . This did the trick when needed to read specialty Rockewell Automation pc cards on a new Lenovo laptop with Windows 7 Ultimate / pro ( 32-bit ) .  
  I have medium size hands and this camera fits nicely . I like the larger fonts and LCD screen , being 58 my eyes need a little help . The settings are easy to find and change . The battery life is great , you can shoot all day long . Using a lens with IS cuts it down a little . I like all of the adjustments for the picture styles , you can change the contrast , saturation , sharpness or color tone . You can even make your personal settings and save them . For being the cheapest Canon DSLR this is a great camera . I have three Canon digitals the G3 , 300D , and 400D and I like them all .  
  I recently got a new laptop for use at university and wanted a good way to carry it around . A lot of my friends in our computer science department and other people too , including my girlfriend , had these ugly big laptop bags that had about 20 inches of ultra ballistic padding in them . I decided that was not what I wanted to drag around campus with me , so I started looking at backpacks with built in notebook holders . I checked out Best Buy and was disgusted at the prices , so I checked here . I found this nice one from Kensington and saw that it was via Circuit City , so I went to the store today to check it out . This thing is pretty awesome - I reall ylike the MP3 player pocket with the line out spot , and also it has a nice ammound of padding and is really comfy . I 'm ordering it tonight , really looking forward to it showing up !  
  No Issues observed - about a month of use . Does what its supposed to do .  
  I 'm having the same power related problems as other reviewers . After going through 2 units with Amazon it appears that the power adaptor they are shipping with it does not supply enough power to run high-capacity drives . According to Macally the problem is only with 300gb and larger drives , but I am having the issue with a 250gb seagate . Apparently they have been shipping a larger power supply for the last couple months , so perhaps amazon has some old stock . Otherwise the enclosure seems well made and I expect it to perform well once the new adaptor arrives from macally .  
  I love this camera ! This is my 3rd digital upgrade since beginning with digital cameras . I am not a pro in photography , and have no real desire to get into the nitty gritty of apatures and all the tech stuff .. but I care deeply about getting some great pictures . SO .. I deal as much as I have to with the technical . I especially love candid people shots , and do a lot of indoor photography in places where constant flash is undesirable , such as weddings and other church services . I discovered that what aids this the most is a big lens , stabilization and good zoom .. which led me to this camera , and I was NOT disappointed . The larger lens has allowed me to get the most amazing indoor with no flash pictures . Yes there are still limitations , and I still get a percentage of blurred photos , but not anywhere near as many as I use to . And the zoom ! I just returned from AZ where I took a river boat ride , and a flock of mountain sheep was spotted high on the canyon walls . I could barely see them with my naked eye .. could only really spot them from movement , but I zooming in fully , and kept clicking . Wow ! I got the most amazing pictures . I 've also gotten some great pictures taken from those tiny airplane windows as the plane is taking off and landing . Some great overviews of the San Francisco bay .. and was able to zoom into some boats on the water even . The color is great ! You ever try taking people pictures of people who don't like having their pictures taken .. like family and friends ? With this camera I turned off all sound , use no flash , and am able to zoom in easily from across the room , and I get the best family and friends candid pictures ! Also the best thing I did besides buying this camera was to get an extra battery , and buy a 1MB media card . I seldom run out of room or battery power ( beyond this ) even when I 'm on an extended vacation . Even after 2 weeks in AZ , I just took my SD media card to WalMart and had it put onto a photo CD .. and cleared it for more pictures . I only needed to do this once .. and took over a thousand pics ( total ) on vacation ! All in all I 'm now drooling over the newer and improved models of the same camera ! Pros : Large lens , great zoom , super color , very stable , comfortable grip , good settings and able to take great pictures while you are still learning them . A great point and shoot camera for non technical people who still want great pictures . Cons : I usually use the auto focus and there is a delay of a few seconds while the camera focuses before I can snap the picture . This is a pain sometimes , and I miss some great spur of the moment pics because of it . The lens cap is a pain , too , as it is not attached . I haven't yet , but am afraid I will lose it . I wish the camera was smaller , but wouldn't trade off the larger lens for lesser quality .  
  I bought the set a while back and had to purchase a audio card to use the set properly . If the sub blows or starts rattling which mine did the set is toast . All the speakers run through the tiny 4inch cheap sub . So when it goes , don't expect to replace it . I talked to logitech to get a replacement , they basically laughed and said go buy some more speakers . So I now have five speakers that work but no way to listen to them . Great , nice paper weights .  
  It 's just a waste of time and money getting this item . It just does not work ! ! ! !  
  I bought this stand in order to have something small to carry . At the same time I bought a Griffin Loop for my iPad . The Arkon is so adjustable and convenient , I 'll probably use it 99 % of the time and leave the Loop in one place . What a pleasant surprise . I highly recommend the Arkon Fold-up travel stand .  
  VHS Head Cleaner Tape worked very well . Cleaned my VHS better than other tapes . Great value .  
  I am happy with the quality of the web cam . It takes good video and has clear sound . The only thing that I am disappointed with is the computer mount . It is kind of awkward and sometimes falls off of my computer . Otherwise it works great !  
  For the price this little box works perfectly . I use it to recover data from computer that quit working I need to extract files from .  
  I 've had this a while now and connect it to my Bose Portable SoundDock since I use an Android Phone . I find a lot of these retractable items break and so far after about 6 months of regular use have had no issues .  
  I got this Palm from eBay and I love it . The clear case is really desireable and attractive . At $ 29.00 usd it is a very good unit . I suggest this for anyone if you are a beginner or even an advanced user of palm pilots . Thanks .  
  This Model is a PLAYER / RECORDER with only 10-Second Shock Resistant Memory ( when most have 40 sec . ) , Multi Function Remote Control and 3-Mode Digital X-Bass . It sounds pretty good , but it lacks a good buildquality , that you might expect from SHARP . It looks great and user-friendly , but it 's just no IT .. you 'd expect from a company like SHARP that it would release a better device that could compete with those of other companies , and most of all - with SONY . Don't get me wrong - I like this MD , and use it alot , but I was kinda disapointed .  
  My new " external memory " has already saved me in the few days I 've owned it . No more losing slips of paper with phone numbers and todo lists and reminders . I love the ability to add memo / notes to appointments and to do items - let 's you keep the follow-up information with the original trigger . Husband is already making noises about getting him an orange one .. and he scoffed at me for wanting one to begin with !  
  Only a few things to say , fantastic print quality , lots of ink and it lasts . As mentioned in the title , this is a genuine , non-refilled Canon ink cartridge so you are getting the best !  
  The standard monitor risers were just what we needed . We used them for 2 pc monitors and 1 tv .  
  The product arrived in a timely manner and in fine shape . I 'll remember this vendor for next time .  
  I really like this ereader stand that I ordered . It folds neatly & my ereader fits on it vey nicely . I thought at first it was a little too high priced but so far has proven to be worth every penny . I would recommend it to anyone .  
  I recommend this Zenith DVD player . It may not be the best player , but for the price and the features it provides , it 's worth your blood , sweat , and tears . I 've had this DVD player for three years ( Christmas 2003 ) and I haven't had a problem so far . Those people who had a bad experience with this DVD player should be kept away from electronics definitely . Either they 're impatient , careless , abusive , or overall just plain idiots .  
  I bought the Wacom Graphire2 Pen as replacement for the discontinued Cross iPen because I have to use Windows 2000 and there 's no iPen driver for Windows 2000 . I have tendinitis in my arms and they get sore quickly when I use a mouse , touchpad , or trackball ; so I 've use the iPen for 5 years instead . Instead of the absolute positioning that you would used for drawing , I use both products in their relative positioning mode ( Wacom calls this Mouse Mode ) where moving the pen about an inch move the pointer from one side of the screen to the other . Since we can make very small precise motions with the hand we used to write with , this worked very well with the iPen . The Wacom pen is much harder to use because it abruptly shifts from absolute to an accelerated relative positioning when it 's moved the same distance . I 've endlessly fiddled with the control panel settings for mouse speed and acceleration and just can't get it to work smoothly like the iPen . But the most annoying misfeature is that the pointer jumps a significant distance on the screen whenever I press the Wacom pen onto the pad to cause a left button click . I 'll be the first to admit that my use of the Wacom pen is not the most common , but for this use I can only give it a 2 star rating .  
  The Powershot A520 On Switch stopped working right after I started using the camera .  
  I needed a short CAT5 cable to connect my router to my cable modem . This one foot cable worked perfectly , as the router is right next to the modem . I did not want to bundle up a longer cable for this very short run . I have all the tools , testers , connectors and wire to make up my own patch cables , but for $ 2 a piece , it was easier to just order a few of these cables . They worked just fine when I received them and plugged them in .  
  This was purposely bought to play my iPod for the enjoyment of all in the car on a long drive . I was driving a borrowed vehicle without an iPod adaptor and hoped this would play well enough in the car for everyone to hear . For that purpose it was great . As soon as we passed out of normal radio reception it was put into action and handled it admirably . The only problem was once everyone else was napping I had to handle the controls myself and , trust me , it is not made for easy manipulation while driving . Trying to adjust the volume so as not to disturb the sleeping passengers was not easily done . I ended up turning it off and resorting to my earphones . For any other purpose I would recommend this as an inexpensive docking speaker for an iPod . If you 're looking for superlative contruction , ease of use and sound quality , this is not right for you , but if your looking for an inexpensive docking speaker it does what it is intended to do .  
  I am a major Secret History fan and waited anxiously for the arrival of this new work . I was impressed with the first 50 pages - the evocation of mood was incredible and I was prepared to plow through the book at lightning speed . By page 100 something bizarre started happening . My eyelids began to droop . I thought it was a fluke and laid the book aside . The next day it happened again ; within 20 pages I was dead asleep and drooling on the pages ! Still in denial , I continued this ritual for almost a week . One Friday night I fell asleep 3 separate times , each time wrenching my eyelids open to begin again . Finally , defeated , I had to admit to myself and others - THIS BOOK IS JUST PLAIN BORING ! I was devastated ! Too many words , very overwrought and overly dramatic , and just plain dull . Even editing the number of sentences that include the word " ferocious " could have reduced the tome by 25 pages ! Ah , well , 10 more years isn't really that long to wait for the next one ..  
  It 's hard to find as long a lens at a comparable price , but there is a " you get what you pay for " factor . Of all of my Canon lenses ( I have seven ) , this is the softest and offers the least contrast . It performs best in bright light when you can stop it down to f / 14 or better . I have used the 400mm lens with both the 1.4x and 2x Canon extenders ( 1.4 is better ) . It 's a comparatively slow lens . BUT the 400mm f / 2.8 is over $ 5000 more ! So you can see why " bang for your buck " means something . Also , this is a _ much _ lighter weight lens than the faster Canon telephotos . Finally , it is not image stabilized , so you will likely want to a solid tripod or monopod . On balance , if you don't need the very finest optical quality , this lens is well-worth the price .  
  I originally ordered a laser for the Xbox 360 . Only to be sent a 1600 XBL points card . It took longer than expected to arrive and only when it did arrive did i see that it was not at all what i ordered . I tried to contact the supplier only to get no where and returns were not allowed . So I was stuck with an overprices XBL points card that I had no use for and wound up selling it to a friend for half of what i paid for it ( sold to friend for $ 15 . I paid $ 30 unknowingly ) I do NOT suggest this supplier for anything . They pulled a bait and switch and I have stopped purchasing from Amazon since this poor purchasing experience .  
  I 've formatted ( FAT 32 ) the 16 gig USB drive a 4-5 times now . No problems and it 's working great so far .  
  This works incredibly well . Got it to plug my USB3.0 Toshiba external in cuz it wouldn't work before and it did the trick . It has an a / c adapter to give it more power so you are able to connect 3.0 devices to your 2.0 port . Btw , I have a mac pro ! Plus , it comes with a couple charging ports . Best thing I have bought so far !  
  BACKGROUND : I am an amateur astronomer and Vice President of the local Astronomy club . I ownseveral pairs of large binoculars and have looked through many more . My needs werebeautiful images of deep sky objects at a price I could justify . The Celestron 25x100Skymaster Binoculars meet those needs . GENERAL COMMENTS : The binoculars arrived July 2004 and had a collimation error of about 1 degree ( verybad collimation ) . Celestron support was contacted at the request of Amazon supportand confirmed what I already knew , factory repair was required . I lacked the skillsand equipment to collimate and refill with nitrogen . Amazon promptly picked up thebroken pair and delivered a new pair in just a few days . What a difference a few daysmade . The new pair was packaged inside a secondary box and arrived in pristinecondition . Daytime collimation was excellent . We tested the binoculars afterastronomy club on a distant lighted sign and found them to be essentially flat to theedge of the field of view with a minor vignetting at the edge . Everyone was impressedand several members wanted a pair . During the club meeting I suggested thateveryone who wanted a $ 500 pair of binoculars for $ 250 needed to go to Amazon andpurchase one before the price went up . I sky tested the binoculars a few nights later and they performed very well . I had onlyabout 20 minutes till the clouds took over . Due to the high humidity and generallypoor observing conditions we were unable to use the binoculars for an extended timeand get a really good test . A tripod is pretty much required for astronomical observing although you can lay onyour back and observe the zenith . You have to hold your breath and squeeze up tightto get a steady image . I was able to hand hold the binoculars during daylight andlook at distant trees , etc . It was very difficult to hold the binoculars with one hindwhile adjusting the focus with the other . Leaning the binoculars on a steady objectsuch as a fence would probably work . Note that not just any tripod will work ( readbelow ) , so if you used these in the field you will be packing a lot of weight . Irecommend that they be used pretty close to home or car . CONCLUSION : But , based on what I have already seen , this is the best buy for the money I havemade for astronomical equipment . CAVEATSI highly recommend purchasing these if : 1 . you can handle the weight ( these puppies are heavy ) 2 . you want to see bright images of distant objects3 . you can deal with lack of center focus ( not good for moving objects ) 4 . you are very careful not to jar them out of collimation ( big binoculars are easilyknocked out of collimation5 . you want excellence , and also a bargain ( better binoculars are availablefor an order of magnitude more money . 6 . you have a sturdy tripod ( I have a Bogen which cost over $ 100 25 years ago and it seems barely adequate ) . IRRITANTS : 1 . First pair arrived in only the product box and I suspect that may have contributedto the collimation problem . You should be ready to send a pair back if they do notdeliver a good image . 2 . the " built in " 1/4-20 threaded adapter which attaches to the tripod head isundersized and has movement . There is a single screw which was not tight on bothpairs which when tightened would slow the play of the center shaft . There is a plasticsleeve between the adapter and the shaft which had play and this could not beremoved ( again , same problem with both pairs ) . When the know was tightened to themax the binoculars were still not very snug . The result is that if there is anyunbalance in the weight on the tripod then the adapter is unable to hold the weight ofthe binoculars and the binoculars will swing to a more balanced position . I believe thatthe solution to this problem is to build one of the " binocular holders " seen in " Sky & Telescope " or " Astronomy " magazines which will hold the binoculars steady whileproviding a counter balance . Otherwise , you will have to be extra careful . Also , thetightening know should be larger for people like me who do not have the strength ofsuperman . 3 . there is an old adage that the mount is half the price of the telescope . A mountwhich fully supports the binocular tubes at both ends would perform better than theinadequate mount provided . For those mechanically inclined , the solution is straightforward and inexpensive . It could take 10-15 hours of time ( at least for me ) .  
  I got this little piece when I was in vacation to Eastern coast in July 2004 . After more than 2 months usage , I felt obligated to write review to help other buyer to make their decision . 1 . Outlook : it has a shape as triangle for the corss-section , which make it really grabby while jogging . I take off the strap , coz I don't like anything hanging around my neck , even it 's weightless . The shape design make it very resisstanct to shock . I fell it down to the concreate graound from 2 feet high , it works well without any trouble after that :) Can't imagine If I am using a harddisk mp3 player , what will be the result ? ! 2 . Button : 3 buttons on one side , which handles power , programming tracks , changing EQs and play modes , and changing the player from MP3\FM\DVR ; 5-way navigation stick on the second side will handle everything else ; a hold button on the third side . The player has quite a bit of functions , so the user interface can take some getting used to . Also the LCD with green backlight , make you could operate even in dark . the only drawback is the navi stick make it almost impossible to operate with only one hand . 3 . Menu : I updated the firmware as " UMS " from the support of IRiver 's web site . then I could use it just as a small compact flash driver with USB interface under both WinXP and Linux . The greatest feature of the player is the latest firmware revision is the " Xtreme 3D " DSP mode together with a full 5-band equalizer , which presents a much wider , deeper soundstage , without messing up vocals or imaging . The player supports MP3s , WMA files , and also has a built in FM tuner . ( Newer models also support OGG ) The DVR / repeat function is really nice while I am practicing my french language . It always picks up where you left last time . 4 . earphone : Sound is awesome ! in the mode of 128K + MP3 or 96K + WMA , the sound from the player is excellent even without the Xtreme3D activated . The iRiver is easily one of the best sounding portable players of any type available , but it needs quality cans to really work its magic . be carefuly when shopping the earphone . The iRiver can only output 10mW @ 16ohms per channel , so high powered earphone like Sennheiser HD-650s aren't going to work . 5 . misc : the battary could only last for 3-4 days , with daily usage for 2 hrs , shorter than what they claimed to be . maybe it 's because I am using rechargable battery ; although 256 MB space needs my requirements , the speed of transfer is painful , transferring a whole albums at 150 MB costs about 5 mins , corresponding the transfer rate is ~ 0.5MB / sec . Conclusion : It 's a pretty good mp3 player , considering the price is dropping from $ 150 to $ 120 . Nothing is perfect , so , it 's worth of the money you invested into . Remember , People always get what they paid for .  
  Bought this for my mom who is older and still has a bunch of cassette tapes . You have to jiggle the tape to get it to go in fully but , it does work . Not the best but , for the price - I can't complain .  
  The headphones are of a great design , and the sound quality is good . They are NOT a durable set of headphones . I carry them in my gym bag , and after about a week , they broke where the black and silver meet . I bought another pair , because they are a really great design to work out with , they hug your head nicely while working out . They too broke after about a week . Good design , Bad materials .  
  Great deal on a tiffen filter . Pictures come out sharp with no glare . A great way to protect your expensive lens .  
  Overall , this was the highest rated monitors by various sites due to its 8bit panel / color quality , adjustability , etc . I upgraded because I was getting headaches looking at my 19 " CRT . Well , so far no headaches with this LCD , other than figuring out how to initially configure it so that I could stand it . I am using sRGB with the DVI input and I calibrated it with the PerfectSuite software tool , which wasn't too difficult . Even then , it was annoyingly bright and text was hard to read . The huge trick to improving the vividness of the color and pleasantness of the image was kicking down the gamma in my video card settings a few notches ( mine is now set at 0.80 ) . Big difference . Also , if you haven't upgraded your video card 's software for a long time , the switch from CRT to LCD would probably be a good time to do that so that you can make sure you 're using the latest and greatest . With the text , as another reviewer said , Cleartype ( Control Panel | Display | Appearance | Effects ) makes a big difference in smoothing out the jaggedy look and it 's easy to turn off if you don't like it . It does occasionally cause images not to display on page , and sometimes a font is a goofy size , but other than that it 's doubled my enjoyment of the monitor . I used the online cleartype tool to refine it a bit . The monitor is very easy to adjust and you can add the rotate settings easily to your desktop so you can view the screen in portrait mode . ( PerfectSuite | options | preferences | Enable menu when right clicking on desktop ) . BTW , if these monitor manufacturers knew how to document the things people care about , this type of info I just gave you would be in the manuals and people wouldn't have to spend hours scrounging around for it . Finally , if you get that annoying theft deterrent message with this monitor , which comes up after you upgrade PerfectSuite for one , you fix it by turning off the A / C switch in the back , then holding the UP arrow and Power buttons at the same time . Keeping them pressed , turn on A / C and wait until you see " All Reset . " Then you 're good to go .  
  I am new to SLRs and the kit lense can only get you so far . When i purchased this lense , I couldnt have been happier . The pictures are so clear and beautiful . I spent months trying to figure out what company to go with since there are so many to choose from , and i am very happy i picked the pentax lense for my pentax camera .  
  Don't buy this camera or any other DISC Sony Handycam ( sic ) ! The video cannot be just downloaded on your computer , comes in vob format , so you have to buy expensive program just to download on your computer ! The photos download but always state " read only " so you have to figure out alot of different key strokes just to get around this . NOTHING is simple about this camera . In picture mode the camera produces low quality images and is tempramental about focus and shoot . Nothing happens fast with this camera ! You must buy a disc to operate and they are expensive . The slightest dust or small thing on disc and camera will not operate and may even damage camera . Sony has received a zillion complaints on this camera , google it and you will see what I mean . This is the WORSE product Sony ever produced ! and is definetly a black mark on them ! Try their " Technical " assistance on any problem and you will get " ship the camera to us for repair , which of course has high minimum cost ! Save your money and buy electronic digital camera ! And one that does not say " Sony " on it ! Even a cheap Kodak is better than this garbage camera .  
  ( Judged using an RCA RC5220P DVD Player connected with a 2ft . S-Video 2 Monster Cable . ) I wasn't buying a TV just for the heck of it ; granted , I didn't have a huge amount of money to spend , but I wanted something good . With the money I had set aside to buy a new TV , the dilemma eventually came down to 24 " or 20 " flat screen ( for around the same price ) . Now that this television is in my home , I 'm in heaven . The picture I 'm getting is more astonishly impressive than it was in the store . " 24 " [ starring Keifer Sutherland ] has never looked better . The television is so clear in fact that even the movie " High Fidelity " blew me away , visually - and that 's not the type of movie I 'd normally use as a test . Video testers are usually movies like " The Matrix , " " Lord of the Rings , " " Unbreakable , " " Toy Story , " etc . . . . but for a movie with no particular visual flare to still make my mouth drop , that says something . The great thing about it is that a complaint I 've had for years - when I watch a DVD , I want the black bars on the top and bottom to be as black as possible without darkening the movie itself . With this television , the blacks are black and the whites can't get any whiter . The colors pop and the sharpness almost refuses to look pixelated , thereby resembling film cells . Lots of control over video and sound , so you can tweak them to your liking . Easy and efficient remote control and menu system . Top it all off with inputs ranging from RF all the way up to the highest standard , component , along with the PHILIPS brand name and you got yourself a television well worth 200 bucks . [ Think 20 " is too small ? Go with the larger versions of the same : 27 " Philips 27PT643R and 32 " Philips 32RF82S . To big ? Try the 14 " Philips 14RF50S . ]  
  Seems like a great idea . It was a gift for my son and he seems happy with it . So far it has stayed clean and odor free . It arrived in good shape and on time .  
  I bought this item for my new ipod touch . Very easy to use and the sound is great .  
  This is an excellent product for the price . Because of the size of the unit , the speakers fall a little short , but it plays and stills sounds good .  
  Battery works well without any problems . I do need more memory for my old PC though !  
  Excellent Notebook . But attention : if you are going to use another Operational System in this Vaio , Know that Sony only support drivers for Windows Vista . No modem driver , bluetooth driver , soundcard drivers , etc etc , for Windows XP , 2000 , and so on .  
  I just got my iPod nano today . Having read reviews on the internet claiming this particular make scratches easily , I purchased the DLO Jam Jacket-the only clear protective case the store sold . I got in the car , opened the iPod and then the jam jacket case . I looked at it stymied . In my hand I held a piece of rubber with little holes-and no apparent place in which to take out the display model and put in my nano . I had to finally had to stretch the case open where the recharger goes and hold the end with my knees when putting the nano in . It took me the whole car ride home ( 20 minutes ) to get it in there ( don't worry , I wasn't driving ) I finally got home and set it on my desk . When I went back a few minutes later , I could barely see the screen ! This jacket is a dust magnet , and that stuff isn't very removable on a rubber surface . Not to mention the enourmous air bubbles forming on the protective layer over the screen - making it impossible to read . As for the jacket 's claim to be clear , just barely . When attempting to register my purchase , I couldn't even see the serial number on the back . I literally ahd to pry the ridiculous case off . Giving it 1 star , because it does do what it promises , protects my nano . It just made me want to punch a hole through the wall in process . I am definitely going back tomorrow to see if I can return it .  
  These cables work great , I use between my Laptop , and HDTV ! You cant beat Amazon 's Price anywhere ! I 'll be buying more of theses cables !  
  I bought this product so that I could back up my music and photographs . After reading the other reviews I figured it was a great purchase for the price , they were right ! It was so .. simple to use :-) I would definately by this in the future or recommend it to anyone .  
  This light isn't going to light up your room , but when angled sharply so that it shines horizontally across the keyboard , it does what I was hoping it would do . I am currently deployed in Afghanistan and because of the different shifts , someone is always sleeping in my tent , so I wanted a light to help me see my keyboard but that wouldn't be too bright . This little light is flexible enough to come around the side of my screen , but stable enough that once I set it where I want it , I can do my college homework for hours and never have to readjust it . Three stars for brightness because it 's only one LED , so if you want a really bright light , this isn't it . Four stars for construction quality because the lense around the LED is plastic .. I have not had any problems with this product and I don't forsee any , but I 've only owned it for two weeks . Five stars for both portability and flexibility for the above mentioned qualities ! Overall , an excellent prodcut . I 'm very happy with it ! Sgt Pruett  
  This is a fine product that does exactly what the instructions say it will do . Sometimes you have to really work one section of a disc where the scatch is . It takes effort and some time . But , it is worth it . I would rather put 10 minutes of work into a cd than buy it again . You are told to read all of the instructions first - which some of these reviewers didn't do . Yes , there will visible marks on the surface of the cd after you are through . As the manual explains , this is normal and will not ruin the disc . Basically you are rubbing an abrasive material on the disc to take of thin layers of the plastic . This will slowly remove scratches and scuffs . Of course it will not look like new - but it will play like new . I don't know about you , but I don't own cd 's so I can admire it 's reflective beauty . I like to listen to them .  
  The score I give these earphones has nothing to do with the sound , let me make that perfectly clear right off . My experience was , of course , totally subjective and this review is only intended to serve as a warning for what I 'm guessing is a relatively small group of people . They sounded fine , especially once I found the right size flange . My only issue , and the only real reason I wanted to even write a review , is to let people know that if you have small ears these may not work for you . I have small ears-I 'd never noticed before but my wife confirms this-and the ear-hanger parts never actually made contact with the tops of my ears . They stayed in fine due to proper fit in my ear canals , but then I just had these soft plastic parts sticking up and a little bit out from my ears . They just didn't fit right no matter how I futzed with them . The cord is molded into the ear-hangers , so removing them-and just turning them into regular ear-bud style headphones-is not an option . Again , the sound seemed just fine , and I 'd agree they sounded better than the stock iPod buds , they just never fit right . Again , your mileage may vary , but if you have small ears ( get a second opinion ! ) you might want to look at another style of headphone .  
  I live in an apartment and wanted to limit the sound while watching movies at night so as not to annoy neighbors . I 'm not picky . I have a cheap computer monitor with HDMI and some cheap computer desktop speakers . I 'm an audio engineer so I was about to spend 100 bucks on a normal rack compressor . Why not ? But this thing , as cheap as it was , seemed worth the risk . I 'm not picky , right ? Well , this thing is in a dump somewhere now and I have an Alesis rack compressor in front of my speakers . :) The problem with compressing audio for video is that low frequencies like explosions , booms or a kick drum in the background music , aren't as perceivable to our ears but are extremely loud in actual energy . They trigger this thing to reduce the volume drastically right when you 're trying to hear the dialogue . Audio gear nerds : There are no adjustments - not even on the circuit board . The compression threshold is set too low . There is no makeup gain so you must turn your speakers up to ridiculous - hence the hiss some mentioned . The attack rate is ketchup slow and the release rate is molasses slow . It 's less " pump and breath , " more " pummel and break wind . " If you 're gonna to do this then you need fast attack , fast release and adjustable threshold . A cheap Alesis or Behringer rack compressor does fine . Ok , enough nerd talk . Don't . Just don't . Thank me later .  
  Well , here 's what I have to say : I 've had this little sucker for over a year now , and thus far , this is what my mp3 player has been up against : 1 . NW Washington weather . Need I say more ? 2 . It 's been dropped onto hard marble floors from chest height ( roughly 5 ' 7 " ) TWICE , and worked ( although it developed a minor joystick anomaly that lasted about three days to a week ) just fine , still works like a charm . 3 . It 's been on several camping trips in NW Washington ( again , need I say more ? This place is WET ) . 4 . It 's survived a day in Hana , Maui ( even wetter than WA ) . I 'll tell you , this thing is pretty tough for a little device such as this . I also use it to play music in the halls , on my own sound system , and because my sub is a little funky , I have to readjust my equalizer , and it 's VERY simple , once you get the hang of it ( if you 're having trouble with the custom equalizer , just hold the knob straight down for three seconds , and from there you can figure out how it works ) . It 's been with me all over the country , and in all sorts of situations . This mp3 player is like a Timex ( takes a lickin ' and keeps on tickin ' ! ) , and the best part is , it gets GOOD sound , too . I have a pair of Sony ( also a year old ) headphones , and a set of Bose QC2 , and the sound through both is phenomenal . I am thinking about trading up to a bigger mp3 player , and I think an iRiver is where I 'll be aiming . P.S. My advice on music transfers is to stick with the provided software , and get the firmware upgrade , and still stick with the software . WMP10 has the strangest ability to add clicks and whops to songs saved at 192 kbps , that are then transferred to the player . The iRiver software does none of that . That 's all for now ! Tata !  
  The X-Acto School Pro Heavy Duty Pencil Electric Sharpener is pretty amazing . It 's not cheaply constructed . This sharpener is meant to last and withstand some abuse . With six sizable holes to choose from you 're likely to find a match for your pencil . The large shaving receptacle allows for plenty of use between trips to the trash . We really like this pencil sharpener , design , and color . However , it 's not without its flaws . First , the points on the pencils can be rather short and sharp , like a needle . The sides of the pencils tend to have a little wood left behind , so you have to put the pencil back in at and angle to expose more graphite . We do like the automatic pencil stop , so many times with a regular pencil sharpener the pencil gets sucked down for lunch and before you know it you 're left with a stub of a brand new pencil ! I can't say it 's " quiet , " but it certainly isn't as loud as a tree chipper , as our older electric pencil sharpener is . Overall it 's a power horse of an electric pencil sharpener , quick and seamless . However , I can only give you this review from a basic home needs with children who use it and not from a classroom point of view .  
  I bought not one , not two , but THREE of these ( Model D1708 ) . All THREE died within in about 20 hours of actual dvd-watching time . And just try to find the company ( Audiovox ) to repair it . No way . I 've looked online forever to find somewhere I can send these 3 duds to no avail . Don't buy this product . Pay a bit extra and get one that will last a while .  
  When and how it looks is about the sound of its knowledge . Knowledge contained in shortwave is not found on this radio . This means the eccentrics of this radio far outdo the nomination . I actually like the looks a lot and am plastic that the sound is real . You should afford this radio with one think in mind . All the others are differing . A good standard reliable home theatre . Thanks  
  If I can remember correctly this did what it was suppose do . I just wish the ring tone volume could 've been lowered and I paid $ 50 for this when it first came out . Now if I could only find something to allow my fax machine to work with one line .  
  Sorry about all the readers who wanted a more conventional ending , in which we find out for sure who killed Robin . The author hints that , yes , it might have been Danny ( consider what his nightmares are about ) , then leads us to believe that , no , maybe Danny was innocent . Either way , what 's important is that Harriet ( and Hely ) decide to try and kill him based on a hunch ( and on class prejudice ? ) not on any real evidence . And yet .. he is an evil man , who tries to kill Harriet . And yet .. he survives . And the story ends , and yet .. it 's not over . Will Harriet move to Nashville ? And why would the father give up his mistress ? And will Eugene decide to leave Harriet alone ? Will Harriet challenge Edie 's genteel racism ? Will Pem and Allison get it on ? The tale continues to resonate .  
  i own one of this first generation mp3 cd players back more than a year ago and it just can't complete with mp3 cd player these days ..  
  PRODUCT ARRIVED INCOMPLETE .. THE ADAPTER AND AUDIO CORD WERE NOT INCLUDED . PLEASE SEND THEM TO : EMILIO GARCIA C / O TERESITA VALDES3400 SPRING DALE BLV APT T103 PALM SPRING FL 33461  
  I 've had this mouse for over three years now and use it daily at work . At $ 14.00 , this unit is a great bargain . The up / down , left / right scrolling wheels are invaluable to me for the drawing tools that I use as well as applictions like Excel . It has tons of configureability options that I 've seen missing on higher-end Logitech devices ( however , I don't believe macros are supported ) . Although I don't doubt that they exist , I 've never experienced any of the software / driver issues that some other users have described-even after installing on various machines . Finally , while it doesn't have the " heft " of some of the other mice I have used , this unit is by no means flimsy ; as I mentioned earlier I 've used mine regularly for three years with out issue . At $ 14.00 you can't go wrong ..  
  I am very pleased with this item . It came promptly and was very easy to set up .  
  Well for a penny , this does what it 's supposed to do . I don't have an amazing TV or top notch bluray and my eyes aren't eagle sharp , but for the simple act of getting a great quality signal to my flatscreen with audio included , this definitely gets the job done . Only slightly sad part is so far , it 's not looking any different than when I had the component cables plugged in . At least it reduced the clutter , down from 6 cables to 1 , so for that alone I think it 's worth the price .  
  We use this in our mini-van on day-long trips . It is not the sturdiest product one can imagine , but it has held up well over 2 years of occassional use . It is strong enough to hold the 7 " DVD player , and even the external battery pack ( we usually use on airplanes ) when its not convinient to plug the DVD into the car . My brother-in-law , who lives in europe , was impressed enough with how it kept my 4 and 3 year old quiet for 9 hours ( multi-episode home-made DVDs of their favorites , like Sesame Street , lasting 3-4 hours are great ! ) that he asked us to send him one and we did . It mounts instantly and easily in any car or van with front headrests on metal " stalks " , and " sags " at just the right angle for viewing , and may be turned a few degrees left or right . One caveat , shown but not stressed in the simple instruction sheet , is that when you slide in the legs to store it , they MUST be turned on their little turntable mount so they slide exactly into protective braces . If they aren't , they 're subject to breakage with very little force .  
  Super fast delivery and the first item I 've seen on Amazon that cost a penny !  
  I love this camera . I takes great pictures and is very easy to use . At first i thought that the picture quality was going to be bad because when it shows up on the cameras screen the quality doesnt look very good but when you upload them onto the computer the quality is great . So far i havent had a problem with the batteries . ( .. ) . We used the same kind in our old digital camera and the old one would quickly use up all the charge but not my new Kodak .  
  I was disapointed with my purchase of this product . When checked it momentarily after opening it seemed to work satisfactory . But when I really began to use it I discovered how difficult it was to keep it tuned in , and keeping it static free was almost impossible . I have high end eqipment so that wasnt the problem . Since I had thrown away my reciept and packaging I decided to take it apart and see if I could hack it in an attempt to get better signal output , and work better it does . I posted what I did at pcawesomizerdotcom . If you are stuck with one of these , this will make the performance far superior to what it is out of the box .  
  The Remote 's online set up went smoothly but some desired features could not be added as advertised or did not function as intended . The Remote functioned after I programmed it but not with a single button for all equipment to work in concert . I had to contact Level II technical support and it took about a week before the remote was completely programmed as desired . Now it functions great . One button click turns on / off the AV reciever , TV and the ATT U-verse system ; plus it is easy to switch to watching a DVD , listening to a CD or the radio with one button click from whatever equipment one might be using .  
  Like the other reviews you have , above , this line of printers wrinkles paper . The trouble shooting is of no help . Using the two-blue tabs at the back of the printer and flipping themcan be of temporary assistance . Beyond that , the Brother line of printers appears to have a defect thatthey just cannot correct . Brother : There is a bug in the printer . There is also a bug in the process bywhich people are able to register these defects . So , the printer is buggy andthe people are defective for not admitting there is a bug . How about putting up aweb page to allow people to register their bugs with this printer ? All : Perhaps it is time for a class action lawsuit .  
  I dropped this on the floor in a building at McMurdo Base in Antarctica and broke the flash assembly . Had been happy with the camera , so found parts online and order the flash . Turned out to be a good number of little screws to remove , but not fundamentally difficult . That repair was a couple of years ago . Last winter I bought much better digital cameras for my daughters at a cost of $ 110 each with extra batteries and cases . Wouldn't be worth repairing now .  
  I purchased this printer for it 's fast printing speed and long life in toner and drum , but it 's really been a let down . The printer has this habit of creasing and wrinkling the paper on the first 2 pages of every print out . So now I have to send 3 copies of everything I want to the printer , wasting paper and ink . I 've tried different kinds of paper , and every troubleshooting option offered to me by the fine folks at Brother , but it continues to do this . I 've looked around the Internet , and found this is a common defect in the 5240 and 5250 models . It 's really an inconvenience , and now I have to purchase a new printer because it 's such a pain . If you love to be frustrated and angered over print quality and paper use , this is the printer for you . Otherwise , avoid at all costs .  
  I purchased this to clean up my vinyl , as I was also purchasing the AT-PL120 turntable . My LPs have been spun innumerable times , and most date from the 60's-80 's . I originally wanted an expensive machine that would remove all the debris from my records , which hissed and popped quite vigorously . As I could not afford that product , I selected the Stanton Record Cleaner Kit . The soft brush is excellent at whisking away dust and debris from the vinyl grooves . The applicator fluid is quite helpful , as well . The kit has vastly improved the sound of my records , and I am pleased with the results .  
  i love this card reader i am glad i got it and it work fast on both 1.1 and 2.0 usb  
  I think I may have found the perfect camera bag . This one is comfortable to wear all day , it holds my Alpha 100 with my kit lens , my 100-400 lens both with lens hoods . My battery charger , manual , misc cables , wallet , phone , misc items such as a small rain jacket . It also has a little pocket for your memory cards . The best part of this bag is that you can swing it around to the front and pull your camera out without having to sit it down or showing everything you have in the bag . The bag is plain enough that most people wouldn't know that you have a camera and all of the equipment that goes with it . Which is a big plus with a women traveling alone .  
  This is my 2nd set of the crimp-on plugs . The sound quality is fine . Of course it is not the same quality as the high end ones , but for me these are fine . No complain .  
  i love , love , LOVE this product ! the thing that makes it even better was the instructional dvd . i am not too technological , and being able to have a visual aid like the dvd to help me program all the components in my house to this device was so helpful . thanks for a great product !  
  I have had my Blaupunkt Sirius radio since April of this year and I have had zero problems from dat one . The quality is excellent - in some areas , you may loose reception for a few seconds - but that it understandable and is 99.9 % explainable by overpasses , trees etc .. Not sure why other seem to have some problems - I live in Florida and maybe it is my location - but I travel often from the gulf coast to orlando and never loose the signal or quality . And the quality is what I expected from Blaupunkt - clear and crisp . I would suggest - buying one with a warranty - in case you run into problems - but as I have said - no problems here .  
  I was puzzled why Toshiba would discontinue the P25 series so quickly leaving the 15 " P15 as the only Media Center laptop they offer , but on with the review . I recently purchased this beautiful machine on discount at CompUSA and I knew this was the laptop that I was looking for . This laptop is truly a DESKTOP REPLACEMENT ( don't look for battery life to be stellar ) with jaw-dropping specs even for a desktop ( except for the graphics which seem a little undersized with a FX Go5200 64MB ) . The unit is put together well but visually , the looks are an acquired taste . Another problem is the keyboard which seems so small compared to the rest of the laptop . A 10-digit keypad like the HP 17-inch notebook would have been a welcomed edition . At least , Toshiba could have put the Windows and Menu buttons in the standard position instead of the upper-right hand corner . With the Media Center Edition of Windows XP , I have gotten rid of the television in my room and replaced it with this notebook . However , I don't see why the television tuner had to be a removable module forcing you to chose between a battery and television . The thing is so huge and so heavy ( 10 pounds ! ) , I think Toshiba could have fit in the TV Tuner . So if you are looking for a true desktop replacment , look no further because , despite some minor problems , this is an all-around excellent machine .  
  I have purchased many cheaper cables before than this one without seeing them first hand before my purchase , and have never really been satisfied with the end result . Therefore , I was kind of nervous paying more for a cable without seeing it in person first . However , I was pleasantly surprised with this piece . the cable coating is of very high quality , as well as are the screw on connectors . I would recommend this to anyone seeking a good coaxial cable .  
  This cable is well worth the price . Double insulated and it even comes with additional sleeves so when you splice the wires it seperates and protects the wires . Well worth the price !  
  I only needed around 350 feet of cable - was happy to find the 500 ft box . Didn't feel like purchasing ( and then having to store / sell ) the 1000ft roll . Fairly easy to feed with minimal kinking . My longest run of ~ 275 ft tested perfectly first try .  
  This is a nice little TV / DVD system . It 's small , wall mountable and has a 90 degree F connector for connecting a regular coax cable instead of just using RCA cables . The picture quality is good and the sound quality is acceptable but not great . Played DVDs , CDs , MP3 Cds and jpeg CDs fine . If the sound quality had been better I would have given it 5 stars .  
  I 'm giving this product 1 star simply because the seller did send me the product . BUT I ordered this product to keep in our camper durring our summer camping season . Because of a busy schedule we only got to go twice . The first time camping I used this product 1 time & it worked . We went camping againover Laborday weekend & the product didn't work @ all . I contacted the seller to let them know the product only worked for 1 weekend & the seller said there was nothing they could do about it . THIS SELLER DOESN'T STAND BEHIND THERE PRODUCTS !  
  Bought the body only & it 's confirmed that I 'm a Canon kinda shooter ! Works faster & is lighter weight than my previous Canons . I 've kept the previous ones as back up .. you never know . But THIS one is a honey !  
  Not much to say for HDMI cables - they either work or they don't . I ordered two - one for my TV and one for my new monitor and had no problems .  
  It says Xerox but it 's not , its from some other country . Sent it back , haven't gotten credit yet & it 's been over 3 weeks , Will be emailing them .  
  this pack is the awsomest ever it has soo many pockets it would be so helpful for ur kids , if they have a ton of books , this thing makes everything weigh less ! its a 10 out of a 10er .  
  This backpack holds everything imaginable , overnight needs if you don't like packing medicines on the plane . Glad I bought it , and it fits in the overhead . Oh yeah it also holds your 17 " laptop with room to spare .  
  It works as expected . I use it to connect my macbook to my HDTV with a minidisplyport to DVI adapter  
  This worked great ! I use it for a specialized vision testing system , of which I was told by the manufacture would cost me $ 800 with their new remote . Found this and needless to say I 'm a happy camper , easy to use and saved me $ 760 .  
  Overall I am very happy with the device . It can " see through walls " which is great , so I don't have to keep our AV cabinet doors open all of the time . It has a pretty neat macro feature , so you can program it to turn on all of your devices with one button ( TV , AV receiver , cable box etc ) . You can also program it so that the volume control will work your main device ( in our case the AV receiver ) without having to select the receiver first on the remote . It comes with a DVD that will walk you through the programing of the remote . My only complaint is the backlighting - it is there , but it is pretty faint , so it is a bit more difficult to navigate in a darkened room . For the price though , it 's hard to beat . There are similar universal remotes in the $ 200-$600 range .  
  Most credit cards ( Amex , Visa ) offer loss and damage protection , and extended warranty protection . Amex , for example , doubles the manufacturer 's warranty up to and for at least 1 year . Research your credit card benefits before investing 20-25 % of the product cost in extended warranty protection . I think it 's worthless .  
  I used a lot of different mouses and this one is definitely the best for traveling . It is small and beautifully designed . I only used it for 1 month so I do not know how long a AA battery will last , but my friend confirmed it is up to 3 months even you leave the transceiver attached to the PC or Laptop . By putting back the transceiver to the bottom of the mouse will turn it off and conserves battery power . What I would like is a smaller transceiver like that of the Kesington model 72117 . That wireless mouse is also a good ergonomic design but the sensitivity is not as good as the Slate mouse . If you have a big hand you may not like it . Great mouse for traveling .  
  turns out that it is a very good product . Some digital camera 's LCD panel is not real time , you can see the time lag .. but not this one . With the 35 dollars rebate , it is the best possible price for a 2M pixel camera with 3x optical zoom . And it is made in Japan , not some other countries in which I don't really trust the workmanship .  
  I purchased this unit because it is small and would fit in the van . Researched it , saw it 's good & bad reviews and took a chance . I tested it before wrapping as a Christmas gift for my son and it worked fine but had some short pauses . I figured at the price this was acceptable . Within a week it is locking up on DVD 's it played fine 2 days earlier . Never tried it on CD 's . It is going back tomorrow for a different brand . Purchased it at a local store .  
  The sound quality is marginal , due to the cheesy speakers . Some type of dynamic indication of how much disk space is available would be extremely helpful . But generally I am pleased with it since it 's the only one I have .  
  This little transmitter is quite powerful , I don't live in a huge metro area but there are plenty of stations around and this will " step on " them . Of course it won't completely overpower most of them , it does take a decently strong station to " step on " this transmitter . The sound quality is good , I 'd liken it to a good tape deck . I 've used the Belkin products before and this is much better , the Belkins on an open station were weak at best . This transmitter is even stronger than my Sirius receiver 's transmitter . If you have no option but to use an FM transmitter this is a good one to go with , especially given the low price .  
  I had some of the same neg . experience as other customers . The Best Buy guys push it , but it does not live up its promise . I , too , put a small space heater in and it blew after ca . 20 min . And then I found out that the reset button DOES NOT WORK ! Now , I admit , I do not know if you should not put juice hogs in , but then they should tell you !  
  Just got it today this thing is awsome its really thin and lightweight the sound quality is exelent and the headphones it comes with are great they are the kind that go behind your head . I really like the design the buttons are in all the right places . Im only dissapointed about the durability the cover is a little loose and I dont think it has the repeat option and thats why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars . I also like how it looks and its some of it is red so thats pretty cool .  
  Another good mouse from Logitech . As many other reviewers have noted , this little mouse has a lot going for it . Our Acer laptop 's touchpad was rather clumsy to use , so a mouse was quite welcome . The only reason for 4 stars was the lack of an included CD with the necessary driver ; the driver had to be downloaded from the Logitech website . Come on Logitech ; how much are you saving by not paying for a CD ? Otherwise installation was straight forward and took a few minutes . Good price .  
  I recently purchased this case and tested it at depths up to 100 feet in Bonaire . It was easy to open and close and there was no possiblity of having it only partially closed . The controls operated ALL the cameras functions , there was no leakage or fogging . This case absolutely works as advertised .  
  This gives me plenty of room for my camera with its regular lens and tulip hood , my flash , my zoom lens , and tons of incidentals . It lets me walk the dog through the woods , stop and grab a shot , and continue on . Much easier to use than just a regular backpack . Very happy with this .  
  Unlike many cooling solutions I 've tried , the PacificBreeze actually blows air across the entire underside of the laptop . It does this by sitting behind the laptop and elevating it , meaning that it will extend your laptop footprint by about 3.5 inches . On the other hand , sticking out allows it to pull down a lot more air . I 'm so pleased that I 've bought three of these so that I don't have to carry them from room to room . Highly recommended if you overheat the graphics card on your laptop with 3D games .  
  OK ! Do not purchase these speakers to be your primary subwoofer . Sure they can handle guitar base , but thats about it . These will not give the type of base expected by professional DJ 's and serious audiophiles . However , if you need some seriously loud midrange speakers , look no further . I use a American Audio VLP600 to power 4 of these 15 " speakers in my basement . My neighbors 6 houses away can hear me jamming with only mid level volumes and the basement doors and windows locked . Loud , clear , and sturdy construction . The stiff cone handles the low frequencies in the midrange , and can handle some base even with the volume high and blasting , and still keep cool . I would be these again and again if I got to do it over .  
  Great recorder . Voice activated . Comes in handy at meetings . Versatile and yet small enough that I can carry in my pocket .  
  These are very painful to wear for any amount of time . I have a medium sized head and the padsrest on your ears and it is painful . I tried stretching them out on some books for several daysbut they are still painful . Sound quality is good . Good for acoustic music like Jack Johnson , not so good for hip hop or other bass heavy music because the bass gets a little muddy . I do not recommend these .  
  The software that comes with the expander will not download on windows 7 . I search the internet looking for a software compatible with this system that will allow it to download unto windows 7 no luck . I 've been trying to connect the wireless expander and had no luck since day 1 no luck . The extra antenna they suggest for you to buy is useless , because there is nowhere on the expander to connect it to . I had no luck in removing the current antenna and try connecting the new one .  
  We love these headphones - bought to allow me to sleep while my wife watches TV . What I like : Love the comfort - cups with slanted interior that feel better than any other headphones I own . Sound great . Functioning is incredible - only set them in the holder and they charge , just take them off and put them on and they come on automatically , when you take them off they go off automatically ( I have no idea how , it seems when they are expanded it triggers an on / off switch ) . Batteries are AA , which I like in case the factory batter ever wears out . I use the RCA jacks on the back of the TV and used the 1/4 " jack into the headphone stand to connect them . I turn the TV up an down independently ( I have a Sony LCD ) . Finally , they 're Sony , which I 've always had luck with .  
  The price was quite low , so I didn't have very good expectations for these in-the-ear earbud headphones . However , I was quite surprised at the quality of them . One thing I was looking for was a good appearance . I was very happy with the look of these . They don't look cheap like my previous headphones , but very sleek sharp and expensive . All of my friends are impressed with them . Unlike my previous headphones , these don't hurt my ears or fall out as easily as my previous ones . There are a couple of bad things about these headphones such as : They do ocassionally fall out and it is difficult to get the earbuds and plug in thingy to fit in the " case " type thing . I DO reccomend these headphones and I hope this helps you guys !  
  I put 4 stars because I am having a hard time to understand the fax setup but actually it should be 4 1/2 because I love this thing . I am not good when it comes to directions . reading them is out of the ? and I have this thing working all the time . GREAT MACHINE and I NEVER comment on anything expecially computer related ..  
  The product does not do a good job of removing water spots , and that 's primarily what i need it for .  
  So far this is an excellent price and seems to hold a charge well enough . I 've not owned it long enough to determine the long term lifespan as compared to other ' name brands ' that cost double but suffice to say , this is a good value for the intial purchase . This battery is the same size / fit as the L150 for those searching for an affordable spare .  
  A waterproof camera ? Yes , but not one worth taking more than 5 feet under water . If you want to use this for open water , you are better off taking a mental image than spending your money on this . If you want to use this in a swimming pool that has crystal clear water on a sunny day , don't go below 5 feet and you 'll OK .  
  for the money these are excellent . they sound better than sony branded behind-the-neck . the sound is very good . it has deep bass and the treble is crystal clear . they are very comfortable . these are probably the best behind the neck kind avaliable . panasonic and sony srent as good sorry . for only ten these are very good headphones . i recommend them to people who like good sound on their portable music devices like mp3 or cd player .  
  These and the V6 ( more-or-less the same ) ; nothing approaches . Sadly , nothing . Confirming another reviewer , I have more expensive cans , and lots of cheap ones . These are the ticket , period . I guess it 's " possible " something could sound all-around better , but I 've never heard it . To clarify , these aren't " a little " or " slightly " better , " they are leagues-and-bounds better than everything else I 've listened to . Plus , comfortable ! And portable ! Everything and everyone else in my life should deliver like these little bastard ear-cans do .  
  I don't disturb others as I need more volume on the TV etc  
  Fits my Panasonic Lumix dmc fz-35 well . Doesn't distort the image under normal conditions . If you are going to take pictures of the sun or moon or other extremely bright objects , it is best to remove this filter .  
  .. it locks . I purchased my Ipod mini aproximately two months ago and it changed my music life . It 's a great little machine where I can store my favorite songs and listen to them whereever I ago . I don't have to carry so many CD 's anymore because I have all the songs that I like right in my pocket . It works fine and its really easy to use . Although .. yes , it locks and I 've had to reset it a couple of times since I bought it , afterwards everything continues working fine until it locks again . It does not happen frequently but it does occur enough to annoy me , that 's why I gave it 4 stars . Why is this ? I don't know if it is the same with all the Ipods but anyway I just wanted to coment on that . Overall is a really cool product .  
  Canon PGI-5 BK 2-Pack Pigment Black Ink TanksI recently ordered the PGI-5 2-pack toner from Amazon and am very satisfied . Although it took about a day or two longer to ship than I anticipated , the price was excellent and it arrived in excellent condition .  
  the headphones are mainly for a family member who is a bit hard of hearing , especially on deep tones . these headphones have solved that problem and in fact our son likes to use them on his video games . the sound is very good . we are very satisfied and they were a very good price as opposed to the very same ones at sears .  
  I 'm happy - only used it once because that 's all I needed it for , but I was mainly just happy that it worked ! I ' shook ' it for a sec after taking it out of the packaging heard something DIFFERENT .. nothing ! No rattling , pieces , etc . Might never use it again but if they go down in price to $ 5 or so I 'll probably purchase more of them . [ If you are a computer tech , or a beginning tinkerer , then you should take my advice and have backup floppy drives - you never know when you 'll be working on a machine that requires a floppy drive , such as pre-Windows Vista machines ]  
  I bought this to listen to music on my Droid in my 2009 Kia Spectra . It sucks . If I turn the volume up to anything remotely audible terrible static starts to come out of my car speakers . Many people online said to make sure you 're listening while the Droid is not charging , but even when I unplug it from the charger the static persists . I purchased a better quality cable for $ 14 and haven't had any problems . It seems this specific cable is hit or miss , good luck . The good thing is I now have something to fiddle with , pulling the cable out from the retraction thing over and over sure is entertaining !  
  WHY DOES AMAZON SAY THIS WILL WORK ON GARMIN C SERIES ? IT CLEARLY DOES NOT .  
  These speakers are a step up from the crappy ones that comes with basic PC 's . They have decent bass and treble . They won't turn your room or office into a dance studio . You 'd have to pay a little bit more money for that kind of sound . Personally , I use headphones , and the sound that goes in to a good pair of them is greatIf you need a quick pair of PC Speakers with good enough sound , and headphone support , then go for these .  
  I had to interface a Male Type B connector on a 36 ' USB repeater cable to a keyboard pigtail that had a male Type A connector at the end . Worked fine on two applications . Nice detents on the adapter to provide good tight fit .  
  i read negative reviews about the centon waterproof data stick but went ahead and bought the 128gb size as i really wanted large capacity and waterproof usb flash . i just figured these were novice users that did something to cause malefunction but then the same thing happened to me as well . i took it out of package and immediately proceeded to encrypt using windows 7 bitlocker to go , things were going fine for about one hour then it locked up , i spent over three hours trying all the " fixes " shown at centon webpage support , this included several restarts under windows as well as ubuntu all to no avail , i have not had the same issues with sandisk flash drives and have done the same encryption with windows 7 bitlocker to go with several , if sandisk offered a waterproof version i would have purchased it instead . i am in the process of returning this product that i now consider problematic and prone to failure .  
  seriously its JUNK . i plugged it in to my 480 watt amp 2 channel so it got 240 watts and the boxes back part flew off O.O.the sub is not good for low bass so this system is just for the looks . dont even waste your $ 45 . get a nicer brand and spend a lil more but have some decent bass in your car . this is nothing  
  We have 2 Epson CX4600 printers in our office . They recently both needed new ink cartridges . After installing the new cartridges , we only got blank pages printed . We followed the instructions given to us from Epson , to run the cleaning cycles , and still nothing would print but blank pages . When we called Epson for technical assistance they told us that our printers were not under a warranty anymore . One was bought 9 months ago , and the other was bought 10 months ago , and Epson said they aren't under warranty , and the only way we might be able to have them fixed would be for us to Mail them to Epson and they would charge us $ 65 each , to look at them and tell us if they could find any problem with the printer . Because of their lack of warranty support for printers that were bought less than 10 months ago , we refuse to purchase Epson products ever again .  
  This remote eliminated separate remotes for TV , Receiver , Cable Box , DVD Player and the CD player . Logically handles all components based upon selection of interest . Convenient charger as well . Easy to use ! Lights up at touch .  
  It was slow learning all the operating functions as the instructions which came with it , as well as the copy downloadable at the Olympus site , were such small print they required a magnifying glass to read . Also the sound quality is very poor .  
  I recently realised that I needed another one of these beauties to feed my growing a / v habit . As I already had a Belkin , I went with what has proven to work for me . This gives excellent picture quality , and I would buy another in a heartbeat .  
  I recently purchased this ATI TV Video Card which clearly stated " Vista Compatible " . The " FREE " ( $ 11.00 in shipping ? ) remote is NOT compatible . It took me THREE DAYS for ATI to admit that . Clearly the company engages in misleading advertising . My recommendation : DO NOT BUY ATI PRODUCTS .  
  I bought this to start playing records again , very impressed with the ease of use and setup . What 's very interesting overall is that I first had this plugged into my home theater playing straight out .. wasn't impressed with the flat sound . I then plugged it into my Mac running Audio In .. sound was still flat . Then I remembered you can use Garageband , what an amazing difference in sound ! I have a 30 Band EQ , Noisegate , and Compressor running which has breathed new life into my records . I can't even listen to CD or iTunes anymore . Rather than just recording the vinyl and burning to CD , I have been mastering my new and old , followed by iZotope RX Advanced to remove any clicks , pops , and noise . I can honestly say it sounds cleaner than CD now . I recommend this turntable to anyone .  
  This repeater has exceeded all my expectations . It reliably receives and ' repeats ' signals from my router at distances considerably greater than other wireless ' clients ' can even detect the signal . It has helped me greatly in solving the need to extend the coverage of my wireless system ! I am completely satisfied with the price / performance of this product .  
  While you are driving it suddenly stops and the screen becomes frozen . My iPAQ was H5500 which I ordered together with this Navman . Besides , it sometimes gave me wrong direction . I really don't want to recommand this item unless it fixes the problems .  
  I bought one of these brand new about 20 years ago . I 've never had a problem with it , never had it in for repair , and none of the channels are fuzzy . We have it hooked up to our Time Warner basic cable and use channels between 3 - 97 . It 's an old 13 " clunker by today 's standards , but it works great for us in the exercise area !  
  This is a great mouse . It 's comfortable and works great with my laptop . The batteries are easy to access ( not like my other mouse , which the only way to get to the battery was to drop it and the top would fall off ) . The only drawback I find with this mouse ( and I don't believe it 's the mouse 's fault ) is that it stops working when I plug in my iPod . I think that 's an Apple problem that I haven't figured out yet . Overall , this mouse works very well .  
  I have used if for about a month . I cannot the difference when I was using a 6 ft cable . The quality is good and it came well packaged without any damage unlike some other reviewers have indicated . Even paying $ 6 S & H you can't beat this price . I am very happy with its performance .  
  Bought these to pipe an ipod to my sound system , but the output is mono instead of stereo .  
  Admittedly , I don't know the first thing about printers , so before I went out and paid big bucks for a photo printer , I consulted with a guru friend who does professional photography for a living . After a long lesson on how to take good photos , make them printer worthy , and printing , I was told to buy either a Canon or Epson printer . After doing endless research and reading reviews , I had no doubt about going with the i860 . And I 'm very pleased I did . The photos ( 4.1 mpx camera ) are PERFECT ! The printer is super fast and extremely quiet . Definitely worth the price , which was also an extreme incentive .  
  I was presently surprised with the ease of installation and how much distance the wireless covers . Even though the wireless is not as fast as the CAT-five cable connection , it still works for those who wish to merely browse instead of heavy downlaods . I also like that I can tell when there is wireless traffic , clearly indicated on the status lights in front . The login admin controls are also quite thorough .  
  I had been looking for a PDVD player for a long time and this one was great , it was cheap , but high quality , buy it  
  This memory card seems to be working good in my LG VX8100 phone , and I have also tried it in my digital camera using the SD adapter . If you want to buy a card reader for your computer , DO NOT BUY THE Kingston TravelLite SD / MMC Reader ( FCR-HS2MMC / SD ) by Kingston Technology . I have had nothing but problems-computer does not see the memory card in the reader , the reader has caused pics to be deleted , and I had to reformat the card . It never really read the files at all on the computer .  
  Its exactly what I expected . Nice hard shell to protect discs . Easy to slide discs in and holds them very well .  
  It probably does not have all pairs used by GBit crossed over . Hence not working when you have a GBit card in your computer .  
  After trying another competing microsystem , this one is a keeper . It reproduces high , middle and low audio ranges well . It sounds nice out of the box , given it is only 20 watts , and the FM reception with the wire antenna is excellent . Since I have a Cambridge microworks speaker system with subwoofer , I then plugged it into the headphone jack of the CMT-NEZ3 and what a lovely sound she makes now . It now rivals the sound of a $ 400 Yamaha mini-system with the augmented speaker system . This Sony microsystem is well worth the money .  
  Ive had this dvd player for over year now and i have had no problems with it . I have though had problems with the remote . Often i have to either take the batteries out and put them back in to get the remote to work again . Overall though it was worth the money , I would buy it again .  
  Product arrived earlier than expected . Works great . Now I don't have to waste my money on buying an endless supply of batteries to use pocket pod . Thank you !  
  I would say I was also misled .. with an overseas adapter . Need less to say .. it should CLEARLY designate the product if that 's what is being sold ! I had to buy a universal adapter from Radio Shack . At this point ; the camera seems to work fine .  
  This tool is a nightmare to install , especially if you are a Mac user . The installation disk in fact doesn't run on a Mac and there is no support driver that you can download or anything else for a Mac . So I had a Windows borrowed from the office and it took me 2 evenings before , eventually , by trying on the different channels , the installation setup was able to find the signal . After I installed it , it worked , but the reach was never as good as I hoped . In my apartment there are large brick walls , and the repeater doesn't absolutely reach after the second room . Even where working , the device needs frequent rebooting and repositioning ( depending on the day ) , as the signal disappears often . Like 3 times in a afternoon or so . I was told this could be due to the WPA security choice , rather than WPA-2 , but I didn't try anything else , since I was scared to have to redo the installation again .. Anyway , I got fed up with it and I 'm currently looking to buying a new one that hopefully works better .  
  I have been a dedicated film camera user for several years and a skeptic of digital photography . Until now . I chose the Canon S50 after about two months of research into contemporary cameras . I relied upon a digital photography portal called " Digital Photography Review " to compare different models , and then used Amazon to compare prices . If you are making the move to digital , it is wise to factor in the price of image editing software ( I use - and highly recommend-Adobe Photoshop Elements ) , an upgraded memory card , and an additional battery . The S50 does not come with a case , so add that to the list as well . There has been some fair criticism leveled at digital camera manufacturers for their emphasis on mega pixels . I cannot argue with this ; however , having 5-mega pixels over 4 ( at a slight price premium ) does give you the flexibility to later crop images to your liking , yet , retain good resolution . One of the common complaints against the S50 ( over the slightly less expensive 4-mega pixel S45 ) is the issue of purple fringing at wide angles . My own experience has been that , even at the widest angle , color distortions are virtually non-existent in this camera . The image quality is excellent and skin tones are very good even when using a flash . The flash is a tiny band at the top right ( when you face the lens ) but , despite its small size , it is very effective for indoor pictures . The camera is quite small for all it can do . The number of manual controls is astounding ; I have a feeling this camera offers much more creative freedom than my previous one , a film SLR from the mid-eighties , which came with three detachable lenses , a separate flash unit , and a large carrying case that , when filled with all equipment , weighed about 8 pounds ! Digital cameras generally have one drawback-shutter delay , and this is one area that the S50 does not perform well . I have seen shutter delay to vary between almost no delay to little more than a full second . Of course , I have not used other digital cameras , so I cannot tell how this compares . Another weakness is the flimsy lens cover : you have to be careful when closing the cover . I also managed to scratch the LCD screen within a few days of receiving the camera , although this does not affect the images in any way . A protective case would have helped ( why doesn't Canon include one ! ) . The included compact flash memory card has a capacity of only 32MB . I would recommend buying a much larger card ( such as a 512MB card ) that can store a very large number of images ( several thousand at lower resolutions ) . With a large card , the battery inevitably runs out out before the card is full . Buy a spare ! Overall , I enthusiastically recommend the S50 , especially if you are making the move away from film cameras . The S50 has irreversibly drawn me away from film cameras , even though I did not think that was possible just a year ago . Perhaps it will also transform your perspective .  
  These $ 20 headphones sound as good or better than many that cost much more . I also think they will be more durable . Only two downsides * They 're not pretty * They don't really fit in the included caseStill , they 're my favorite portable headphones .  
  This remote does what it claims : co-ordinates all of your devices to act in " harmony " at the touch of one button . It is much more than a dime-store " universal " remote that might control all of your devices separately . Touch " Watch a DVD " and the remote : 1 ) turns on the TV , 2 ) sets the TV to the correct input , 3 ) turns on your AV receiever , 4 ) sets your AV receiver to the correct input / ouput , 5 ) turns on your DVD player , and 6 ) controls the play functions on your DVD player . No more trying to remember which device has to be set to which input / output . Then , you can control each of the devices separately if you want to . Logitech claims , and others agree , that set up is easy . But , Logitech insists that you use only Internet Explorer ( and not , e.g. , Firefox ) , disable your firewall , disable virus protection , and disable pop-up blocking while in set up . Talk about vulnerable ! Further , in my case : the remote " thought " my TV was a PVR and had to be manually tweaked to get it right ; the remote does not recognize the new digital channels ( eg . 4.1 etc . ) , and despite help from tcch support has not been able to " learn " them ; it is tricky and tedious to set the individual device functions ( e.g , my AV receiver has 14 pages ( ! ) of functions on the remote , and getting them organized is an ongoing slog ) . However , tech support is A + outstanding : the call center near Toronto answers promptly , and the techies are knowledgable , polite , and helpful . All in all , this is an excellent product , but don't imagine that setup will be easy .  
  To its credit , the EXP201 is an inexpensive CD player that also supports CD-R 's chock full of MP3 files . It basically means that you can carry 10 + hours of tunes on a single disc and enjoy those tunes on a single set of two AA batteries . I picked up one of these units yesterday and I returned it today for the following reasons : 1 . Horrible sound quality . All my MP3s exhibited a random pop , click , or some other audio artefact during playback . And no , I wasn't listening to Oval , Microstoria , or any other Mego glitchery , and all these MP3s are 160 kbps CBR ( constant bitrate ) files that play with no problems in my PocketPC . 2 . Stability issues . I used my unit exclusively in a car ( a Ford Taurus , in fact , sitting in the front seat armrest ) that did nothing but city driving . Admittedly , Houston streets have their share of potholes and bumps , but my wife 's VW cd changer ( which doesn't have the read-ahead shock protection ) is far , far , far more stable than this player , which produced random skips with alarming regularity . 3 . Navigation problems . The display on this unit is limited to numbers . Which means that when you create CD-R 's of MP3 files , you have to organize them in folders by either artist and / or album in order to be able to skip ahead albums ' worth of tracks at a time . Even at that , you 'd have to have a pretty darn good memory of what order ( let alone which artists ) the tracks were burned onto disc . Having to play ' Name That Tune ' with your own music collection is only entertaining at parties . 4 . Compatibility issues . Despite the reported CD-RW compatibility , none of my DirectCD CD-RW 's would register with this unit . Also , any regular CD-R 's created using the Joliet standard ( which allows long file names ) seem to have the file orders scrambled , as the file names seem to get truncated by the player 's operating system . In order to maintain track order , I had to manually rename 140 + files in EasyCD Creator ( a bit of an oxymoron in this case ) to 8.3 standards ( trying to compose the disc in ISO9660 truncated the file names without maintaining track order ) . So , there you have it . A nice try , but poor , poor execution . From what I 've read , the EXP301 series are significantly better in sound quality , skip protection , and compatibility , so you may want to spring a few extra dollars and save yourself a potential headache .  
  This is the second one of these I 've bought . Now I keep one in the living room and one beside the computer in my office . The large size lets me read whole sentences and paragraphs when the type is too small for aging eyes . Like this type !  
  Programming is easy . GUI is intuitive . Remote is user friendly . Controls all devices that I have in my house . Very flexible programming allows advanced user customization .  
  I got this item from EBay a few days ago to replace a CP Technologies Enclosure that was broken . I initially had some issues with it and I even feared that it had fried a couple of my old HDs . After working with it all night , I gave up and was planning to go to the store the next day to get another CP Technologies enclosure that was more expensive , but my past experience with it showed that it worked flawlessly . I contacted the EBay seller and she gave me instructions to get it working properly , the main thing that I failed to do was that I had to set the HD to MASTER and according to the seller she said I may have to wait 60 seconds until the drive is fully spinning BEFORE plugging it in to the USB port . With the CP Technologies drive , it did not matter what the jumper setting was or how long the drive was spinning , so that was a mistake on my part as I assumed this enclosure would be the same way . After I followed her instructions , the enclosure worked properly , and better yet the drives that I feared were ruined were fine . The only thing that I occasionally forget is to set the jumper to MASTER , or otherwise the drive wouldn't work . Others may find that they have to play around with the jumper settings to get one that works for them . For the cheap price this enclosure is worth every penny . I still think the CP Technologies one is better , but you can't beat the price that this one is offered at . If you want a cheap solution this is the way to go .  
  Works great with Olympus , Kodak , etc . ALL digital camera flash cards . Simply remove the memory card from your camera , slap it in to the slot and presto .. seconds later your images are on your system . Setup was a snap too . Highly recommend ! Much easier than using your camera for uploading pics to your computer .  
  I use it in my jeep and it works great to hook up my iPhone4 without having all the cords and such laying around .  
  We just needed the cable to link a Xmas gift of a new DVR player to our new flatscreen TV . This was easy to order , cheap , and arrived sooner than expected . Setup was a nobrainer , so I was very pleased .  
  I find the keyset quite helpfull . It takes awhile to get used too . Once you do it does help us novice gamers . It is worth a look .  
  These headphones sound really good . They are pretty comfortable as well . They come with 3 earpiece sizes , a big case that 's awkward to use , and a VERY handy little earbud case to keep from tangling the cord all the time . Also , preferred the wrap-around the ear design to the other model the just hangs straight from the ear . Don't think you can find better for the price .  
  So , your kid asks for a digital camera . One at sears , expensive . One at Target , uhh .. well , what about the digital blue digital movie creator ? Simple to use , and quit affordable at a price of $ 99.99 ( and worth it ) , this small camera ( and video maker ) is great for youngsters at heart or at soul . The Pros : You get up to 70 or so pictures when out and about , is very easy to use ( mostly recommended for kids ) , as much time for the video as you want when hooked up to the computer , and Always exciting to use with the digital effects . Cons : Well , no zoom button , and the pictures are kind of fuzzy . Also , only 4 minutes of video when on the road . But if you follow the guidlines , it is a great toy . So are all other digital blue toys . And what do youy expect , a camera that stores up to 5 billion kagillion pictures like a $ 500 one ? Once again , THIS IS MAINLY A KIDS TOY . So for $ 99.99 , I 'd say it is one great buy that is irisistable !  
  I 've had the BIC DV64 's for over a month , and am very pleased with them . I had a pair of floor-standing Wharfdale Diamonds that were about the same size , and the BIC 's sound just as good if not better , and at about half the price . I 've had a good amount of different speakers , and my favorites were an older pair of Boston Acoustics BA150 's . They were Acoustic Suspension speakers . The Bic 's are not as good as the old BA 's , but in today 's world of speakers they are better than a lot of more expensive speakers . I highly recommend them . UPDATE : I love these speakers . If you want the best sound you can get for the money this is it , go for it ! They 're not perfect , but none are , no matter what you pay . I 've had Magnapan , newer Boston Acoustics , Wharfdale , JBL , and Mission speakers , these things beat them in my opinion . I had a pair of old Boston Acoustics , model A150 , that I liked better , as I remember .  
  I purchased this item for use specifically with a TV using cable service . I spend about an hour trying to connect it as shown , but after followingenclosed instructions could only get my TV screen to show ' no signal'One thing I do not understand is the requirement to remove the existing Coax cable . I went on Youtube to see if any help was available , only saw one ' happy customer'but he was not using this with his TV .. using it to control the sound levels while viewing Youtube videos , ON HIS COMPUTER ( not TV ) . I will make another sttempt when I have the patience , then return it if my results are the same as above . \ [ .. ]  
  The keystone inserts were useful in installing a cable home run to seven locations in my home . This will replace old cable that was install using a series of splitters . I am fishing the cables inside the wall so I don't have cables laying all over the house through holes in the floors . I am using the same wallplates to install Cat6 Ethernet Keystone Jacks since I have Verizon and it uses both the coax cable and ethernet . I installed ethernet so I can stream video from other services and hook up computers and printers in the same room if I choose .  
  Please dont waste your money on this thing , the sound is very faint even when turned up to the max and you 'll go through alot of batteries just to use it .  
  Score another Mintek 1770 with a screen that went black . I am single , middle aged , no kids , and treat all my electronics exceptionally well . No spills , no jolts , no abuse , so I figured I 'd take a chance on a portable DVD player with questionable reviews on the quality . Dummy me . The unit never got taken in a car , so it was never exposed to extreme heat , cold , jolts , or power surges . One day I turned it on and the screen was black . Huge disappointment and I go away feeling like a sap for buying it .  
  We have two Kindles , two Droid phones , two computers , and a wifi printer on our home system . The old model G had gotten a little slow and its coverage in our home , 2K sqft , was marginal . The new D-Link DIR-615 was very easy to set up , kept same SSID name and password , and instantly everything was connected and running . I have a very fast computer and can tell the differnce that the new N300 makes . I went crosseyed reading all the Amazon rewiews and finally just picked out a router based on another friends recommendation . Well I am one of the 5 star reviewers . I can not emagine anything more straight forward or easier .  
  Purchased to replace an original Garmin mount that was stolen . This unit works exactly like it is supposed to . It sticks to the windshield very strongly , adjusts sufficiently to allow a good view , and is just an all around good product . No complaints whatsoever . Also , I live in Yuma , and even though it gets VERY hot here I haven't experienced the " suction cup welding itself to the windshield " that others have run into . Then again , I moisten the suction cup before sticking it , and I do not use this unit for driving around town , only when I travel , so it only stays stuck to the windshield for a day or two at a time . For theft deterrent reasons , you should be taking it down anyway , to make your vehicle less of a target . You would THINK that thieves would not steal just an empty mount , but in my case I found out the hard way that they WILL steal ANYTHING that is not bolted down , valuable or not . Even if it is just the mount with no GPS , it may make thieves think the GPS is hidden somewhere in the car . Take your GPS with you when you leave , and take the " steal me " mount out of the window .  
  Not going to analyze all the previous reviews .. and I am not sure if this has been mentioned .. the 880 has a motion sensor . You let it rest and the lights go out .. give it a motion ( a simple lift off of the coffee table ) .. and the lights come on .. sweet !  
  This worked great in my 2005 Ion . The color labeling was a bit odd tho . Like there are three red wires and the package says that there are two red and one orange . The power of deduction will soon get the job done , but it is a bit confusing for a little while .  
  i just bought this camera a few hours ago and i already love itit takes great low light photos , and so far has a good battery life . i love everything about it except for the fact that it saves videos as . mov files but that is ok because it comes with quick time . i did however have trouble with the software . i spent 30-45 minutes and still didn't get the software installed on my computer which makes no sense because the same software is installed on the family computer which is almost the exact same computer except for the internet connection . i wound up just using the camera wizard that comes with win xp . so if the software doesn't work on your pc just use that . for $ 150 it is one of the best cameras i 've ever had . which is not saying much because the other ones cost less than $ 60 but still it is one heck of a camera and if you r a 14 year old like me your gonna love it . one more con : the power wheel spins when you pull it out of your pocket . be sure to check out the sample photos i sent in , those were taken in the evening and look better than my natural vision  
  I bought this as a gift , so I only see it when I go visit my brother 's house . It 's great for Home Theater folks who are addicted to their DVR . Works great and at an unbeatable price . He never thought he needed a universal remote ( other than those giant very expensive ones which he was saving up to splurge on ) but when I got him this , it met all of his basic needs . He didn't need to use all 8 of his home theater remotes anymore . Aside from the typical home theater fare , my brother was also able to program his air conditioner controls into this remote , which is pretty neat .  
  HDMI cable works great ! Works the exact same as the expensive HDMI cables for a fraction of the price ! Strongly recommend !  
  This basic HDMI cable works great and was an excellent price . Best Buy charges $ 20 + for this same cord . Great job amazon .  
  I read all the reviews I could find on the internet on this product before buying it .. Some of them where not that good , but I had some concern about reviewers being sold to one brand vs the other one . I decided to try it out , and has been a great product so far . PROS : - Easy to install . Took me a whole 15 minutes to run the wire and install the unit . - Clean install : No wire on your dash , no device hanging in the middle of your windshield . It 's out of the way on top left of my WS , next to the rearview mirror . - Always on : no need to turn it on or off . Just turn the key , the device starts , and will stop when you get out of the car . - Discreet : Ok , maybe not that discreet , but it 's not in the middle of your dash . AND you do not need the remote to use the device . Once it 's programmed , except if you have to make settings change , you do not need the remote ! Cons : - Range is less than a more expensive unit , but since I am not a " hyperspeeder " It does not bother me . Notes : Some reviewers mentionned an abysmall range , poor lateral detections , a lot of false alarm : I experienced none of this ! Now , one thing , I made sure that my unit was pointing right at the front of the car ( my windshield is slightly curved ) , and was perfectly horizontal . Conclusion : it 's a good device overall , but it 's a bargain at that price ! If you are lokking for a RD that will be discreet on your dash , that 's the one to get .  
  I love it . So I bought it on a Wednesday and got it by Monday . Figured that it may help the reviews where all over . I am running an older HP Laptop and it was always hot . I mean so Hot it burned . So I got this product and plugged it in and my wife was like " Yeah okay I hear nothing " So I felt the breeze is so small that there is no way it is going to work . 1-2 hrs later my wife opens the lid and was so surprised . It was so cool that it didn't hurt to type . I would recommend this to everyone . Now the only thing that is annoying . When I go to open the lid the whole laptop wants to tip . It would be nice to have some sort of latch to keep the book in place .  
  The blue lighting is cool . So are the multiple fans , but in a more practical way . It has all the features I could ask for and at a reasonable price .  
  I was wholly unimpressed with the Model Subwoofer . I read the rave reviews of the whole Tivoli Model Two line and purchased the Model Two stereo and the Model Subwoofer . First , let me say that the Model Two stereo is really good . The sound is very clear and transparent across many genres of music . I love Jazz , Techno , Classical and Rock , so I demand a lot from my listening gear . Listening to the Model Two almost reminds me of listening to reference speakers , I could really hear the mix very well . Everyone is right about the FM tuner , I live in Madison Heights and have no problem receiving NPR from Ann Arbor . I 'm glad the subwoofer shipped a day later . Otherwise , I wouldn't have had the pleasure of enjoying the Model Two on it 's own . First , the connections on the subwoofer were loose . Then , after I got the cables plugged in , I tried it out , and wow , what a huge disappointment ! Wow ! I was so underwhelmed that I felt completely ripped off . The bass was muddy , it sounds like the subwoofer is reproducing frequencies as high as 200Hz , which makes the bass muddy , and draws attention to it . On the plus side , the cabinet looks very nice . Now let me box it back up before it gets scratched . I highly recommend using a subwoofer with the Model Two . But use another subwoofer , not the Tivoli . I am using a KLH subwoofer which was purchased for less money and it sounds much better .  
  Very handy way to watch programs on iPad . very sturdy , easy to use . Bought one for myself another as a gift !  
  Right up front , I should say this is a nice piece of hardware , well designed and executed , though for the money I would have liked to have seen a higher-resolution display . The software , however , leaves a lot to be desired . If you have a relatively simple home theater / stereo set up and need to have a remote that will allow someone to push a button a do a few basic things , then this is the remote for you . I 've used a number of programmable remotes , and have 30 years of programming experience , and much of what I see here is impressive . But , if you use your system in a wide variety of ways , have more than one remote controlling your system ( i.e. , one for you and one for your spouse ) , or are used to other truly universal remotes , then this is probably not the product for you . The main issue is that the programmability is on an " activity " instead of a device level . At first this seems logical and easy , but if the way you use your system is not based around a few simple activities , then you are out of luck . THERE IS NO WAY TO CONVENIENTLY USE THIS REMOTE TO CONTROL INDIVIDUAL DEVICES . For instance , if you go to TiVo to change channels , then you MUST change devices back over to your AV receiver to control the volume , and back and forth and back and forth as you channel surf . There is no way to set the volume control to universally control the AV receiver in all modes . For many , this won't be a problem , but it 's not what I expect from a programmable universal remote . I spent over 5 hours working with the software and even called customer support to confirm my findings ( good support group , BTW ) . Unfortunately , my search for the perfect universal remote under $ 300 continues ..  
  Does what i expeccted to do w / o spending heavy cash on so-called superior brands .  
  This is a great wireless camera . Picturer quality is OK ( not the best but OK ) I now have four of the cameras .  
  The price on this AC Adapter was quite reasonable in price and is not real heavy like most adapters . It works fine .  
  Very comfortable , slim profile so it works nicely with both thinner as well as standard keyboards . It works well with the apple keyboards as well , whereas most palm supports are too thick for such a thin keyboard . It is nice looking and I like that it has an antibacterial cover , for whatever that means . This product should be used at the palm at the base of the hand , not at the wrist , as the product title would indicate .  
  I had been using Fellowes WriteRight screen protectors for my iPAQ 3850 , and I have gone back to using them after my experience with the Belkin protectors . I had switched to Belkin as they sounded like they might be gentler on my screen . However , I made several attempts to apply the Belkin protectors , but could not get them applied cleanly no matter how slowly and thoroughly I rubbed them on . Furthermore , they seemed just a shade narrower than the Fellowes protectors , which can lead to slight catches of the stylus as it passes over the far edges of the screen . They did come with a lint free cloth to clean the screen ( something not provided by the Fellowes protectors ) , and that was nice , but that is really all they have to offer .  
  Let me first qualify this review by saying that : 1 ) I am / was a lifetime PC user with no prior Mac experience . 2 ) Before buying this notebook I comparison shopped for 3 months3 ) My computer knowledge is far below that of tech professionals and hard core PC hobbyists , but I am however very computer literate . -> in short I 'm an everyday computer user / consumer . Secondly before contemplating a powerbook any further , if you are an avid gamer or buy 3 or more video games a year and you want to use this notebook as a gaming laptop .. I 'd suggest you you buy a PC notebook for that purpose . Powerbooks are powerful enough to play games , but the mac selection of games is sparse . And now finally to the review .. Specs - As with any notebook I suggest you have at least 512 MB of RAM . This was the only upgrade I added to my Powerbook . The Powerbook comes standard with a very generous 60gig hard drive , USB , firewire 400 , ethernet , WIFI ( b / g ) and bluetooth . The only thing missing is the firewire 800 , but that is not essential for most users including me . The Powerbook also comes with a very speedy 1.33 GHZ G4 . How does this stack up to the new Centrino 's ( Pentium M ) ? Compared to my brother 's IBM Thinkpad with a Pentium M 1.3 w / 512 RAM , it runs equivalent or faster to the naked eye , unfortunately benchmarks are not readily available to compare mac and pc . But needless to say , whatever I can do on the IBM , whether its Powerpoint presentations , Photoshop , Flash , video or photo editing , I can do it on the Powerbook just as fast or faster . Also something that is very unique to this ultraportable is the 64 MB nVidia graphics card . Although there are better graphics cards out there on midsized laptops , ultraportable laptops RARELY have a graphics card as nice as this one . Combodrive - slot loading . This is amazing . No cd tray to deal with popping in and out . Just insert the cd or dvd into the slot and it is ready to go . This is not only a spacesaver since there is no tray , but it also is less prone to break since there is no tray to snag and break off . Why did I not pick the Superdrive that is also offered with this computer ? In a few months they are releasing dual-layer DVD writers that hold twice as much data as writeable dvd 's currently do , so I 'm waiting to get an external DVD writer . Also its good to notice that many computers in order to stay small do not even include an optical drive like the Powerbook does . Price - Sony , IBM , Dell , Gateway . These companies all offer 12 " notebooks , but customize them to equivalent specs as the Powerbook and they all come out approximately equivalent or much more expensive than the Powerbook . Apple is known for higher prices of their computers , but the Powerbook ( specifically the 12 " model ) is a great deal price wise . Battery Life - This is VERY important if you want to tote your laptop around ( and if you don't want to tote a laptop around , then why get a laptop at all ? ) . Battery life is 5 + hours in my experience when just surfing the net and downloading files . Again how does this compare with other PC models ? I think if you research you will find that most ultraportable Centrino 's without an optional larger battery average around 4 hours . The IBM mention earlier lasts us about 4 and a half hours of use . Operating system - I think a description of this is beyond the scope of the review , but in short Mac OS X ( Panther ) is an absolute delight . I personally had very few problems with Windows XP , but it isn't just about the stability of Mac OS X its about the ease of use , integration and beauty of the system . Its something you just have to use first hand to fully realize it . Combine this with the excellent iLife programs that allow you to make movies , listen to music , video conference with relatives , and organize your photos and its very easy to forget about Windows . Design - I recommend you go to a local electronic store and hold the PC laptops in your hand and type on them and just look at them all over inlcuding the bottom . Then take a look at an Apple Powerbook . Again its something that is more adequately experienced than described . From the glowing Apple symbol on the cover to the almost seamless bottom , it is an amazing feeling , solid , and beautiful notebook . Everything else just feels cheap in your hands . Also the screen is crisp and clear and the keyboard is a full-sized keyboard , not a miniature one , that is perfect for typing . Laptop Heat and Sound - Use of the Powerbook for about 4 hours , I noticed it got only mildly warm and much less so than the IBM . However after about 4 hours the Powerbook got about as hot as the IBM , which still is not hot at all . I would say you could comfortably put the laptop in you lap very easily for the first 4 hours . After that , unless you have thick pants or like the extra warmth , I 'd suggest putting it on a table . The Powerbook is very , very quiet , especially when cool . When it heats up after prolonged use the fan will kick in more often and make it a little louder . But still it is much more quiet than the IBM . Overall - I 'd HIGHLY recommend this to anyone except gamers . I 'm highly satisfied with this purchase and I hope you will be to if you decide to buy it . EDIT - 10/5/06I guess this edit is just for people wanting to buy this computer used . Let me first start off by saying I still give this product 5 stars . It is a beautiful machine and very capable . Since this review I 've upgraded the RAM to the documented max , which is 1.25 gigs . My system runs smooth as ever . Also my hard drive failed at about 2 years , fortunately I was able to back up my files due to being warned in advance by OS X. I do not contribute this to Apple though since I have treated my laptop roughly , bringing it everywhere with me ( it is such a small machine after all ! ) and being less than careful . Also the batteries of many of these Powerbooks have been recalled ( Dell and many other companies have had to deal with similar recalls ) . Leopard is going to be released soon and due to the robust videocard ( at the time at least for such a small computer such as this ) I will be able to view the newest version of OS X with all of the Core Image eye-candy intact . 2 and a half years - no virus infections , no spyware , no adware . no blue screen of death .  
  This remote works great . It does a ton of stuff and even though other people said the buttons are too close , I like them . The only small problem I have has so far is it seems sometimes you have to press a button harder than other times . The charging station is a great way to keep track of the remotes location .  
  This wireless speaker system is practically useless . Multiple attempts at tuning , placement , retuning , both speaker and transmitter only resulted in increasing frustration . Static was constant . And this was while using the batteries . It didn't work at all while plugged into the AC . If I had not discarded the packaging it came in , it would have been the first return I made to Amazon . However , I didn't return the speaker system and doubt that I will ever use it . The Advent AW810 900 MHz Wireless Indoor / Outdoor Speaker System isn't worth five bucks . Buyer beware .  
  This works exactly as expected in my Olympus B-5050 digital zoom . It takes charges well and holds them . Also the price was very reasonable .  
  I 've had Motorola modems before and this one works flawlessly , just like the others . Reason for the very-well-priced purchase at Amazon ? .. to save $ 10 / month " rental " charge by Cox for a product that will probably last 3-4 + years .  
  The Panasonic 1080p 50 " Plasma HDTV ordered on Amazon was better than expected . Arrived in less than one week and in perfect condition . The picture quality was also better than expected . Recommend this unit to everyone .  
  This keyboard is a great addition to any home theater setup . The built in mouse track is very convenient . I 've tried several other alternatives and this one blows the others away . I have the USB receiver hooked up through a USB port , and the keyboard responds quickly . The mouse sensitivity takes a little getting use , but way better than having a stand alone mouse unit . This is an expensive unit but well worth the upgrade cost from competitors models .  
  I originally ordered mine in October , and had extended the order . I neglected to extend the last order and now the promotional discount I used has expired . Hmm ? Nothing wrong with the cartidges though .  
  Great value for the money and always needed for that extra storage .  
  This remote really works for me . It controls everything I need it to . Getting it set up required some work and three contacts of tech support . It wasn't as easy to set up as I expected . I have not have a problem with the unit setting in the cradle for charging . I 've tried two other remotes ; this is the one I use .  
  Why spend a fortune on the alleged high performance HDMI cables , that in actuality , do not appear to work any better than these puppies ! I have a set of high end monster cables and I kept switching to see if I could see ANY difference on my Samsung 55 " LED 280hz Flat screen .. and no one in the room could . Save some money here !  
  25 ft for $ 8 ! Are you kidding me ? Nope . Why would you need to buy HDMI cables at the store when you can get them cheaper online ? The cable is thick , about the size of a pinky , but flexible . Connected my PC to my TV and it works . It just plain works . No need to say more .  
  The 909 is the ultimate SW table top / semi-portable radio , period ! Widely sold by RadioShack as the DX-398 , this radio has it all , IF YOU SET IT UP PROPERLY . Antenna : suggest a " slinky " or 50 foot + copper wire antenna and don't rely on the whip that comes with the radio . FM : several issues , including too much signal causing distortion , means it not to be the FM performer one might normally like . However , THIS IS A SW RADIO ! Single speaker : for stereo performance it has a stereo audio plug in for some small speakers if you like . Preset displays for country of origin might say Russia while you are listening to Sweden . Medium Wave AM performance can be enhanced by obtaining a coil antenna and placing next to the radio . Its own internal iron core antenna is limited . With a tunable coil , you will be shocked at how good this radio is at picking up hard to hear AM stations around the country . Tricky antenna plug in : use a stereo audio plug with the tip going to your SW antenna , the mid section to your AM antenna and of course the ground . Have fun !  
  Everything I have read about this product on the Amazon and the Philips websites state that the AC adapter is not included but is an option . the Philips website for this exact model number even shows a connector to plug in the AC adapter . HOWEVER , the product I received with exactly the same model number DOES NOT have an AC adapter connector and clearly states that it runs only on batteries ! So if you really want to plug your speakers in while travelling ( car , hotel etc ) , don't buy these ones .. I returned mine .  
  I purchased this to upgrade from 512mb RAM on a 5 year old Dell Optiplex desktop . I am not a computer person . I 'm tech savvy enough to know where things go and all , but this was the first time I OPENED my computer to install anything . I shut down my computer , unplugged the power , and let it cool for about 1/2 hour , then proceeded to add the 2x1gb RAM by placing 1 in the 1st slot and the 2nd in the 3rd slot , i.e. , stagger the RAM and it works fine . I then plugged the power , turned it on , and voila it worked . So easy . The only issue I had was that my computer finally died ( probably the hard drive ) a couple weeks after installation . I guess my crappy Dell desktop couldn't handle all that power . I highly recommend this product if you 're still running on 512mb and need to upgrade . Easy , quick , and works great .  
  You can get these speakers for a really reasonable price , so that makes them worth to consider . The little bass holes in their front , actually do spit bass sound . They sound ok . I 'm using them .  
  You can't beat the price . Why pay quite possibly 10x more at a big box store when you can buy one here for so much less ?  
  Received the cable in a very timely manner , in working order and great shape ( brand new ) ! Good Job !  
  I don't know where it is coming from or how to isolate it . It may be interference from outside of the home , but every once in a while the lights will flicker even though no signal is being sent from the remote . When this happen , the receiver will not accept commands from the remote .  
  Got this two weeks ago for backing up files from one or two of the servers at work . The advantage of flash drives is that I can carry several of these around and they don't take up much space at all . I was a little bit worried about the speed but that is not a problem with the Corsair . This flash drive is a bit bigger than the Kingston 64gb but the speed is worth it . I 'm not sure what the difference in technology is but this drive is about twice the speed when copying 50GB to it . In addition the Kingston 64gb required a formatting before I could use it . Not so with the Corsair . Worked right from the start . If you need a lot of storage in a flash drive , this is the drive for you .  
  I got this product a while back and it has helped me a lot because I have a mac and PC and the PC doesn't have win zip i have to transfer it to my Mac to unzip and the Kingston data travel helps me a lot I would recommend this over ANY other flash drive . What I love the most is the size it 's small enough to fit in your pocket with your keys and wallet without digging into your skin .  
  I bought these a couple of years ago ( from a big box store ) for use on my workplace computer . The first thing to break was the left ear attachment . The metal adjustment band now slides completely out of the cup as the plastic housing is cracked ( and taped ) . Next thing to go bad was the right ear cable . A few pulls from being caught under my chair wheels and now I have the cord taped in a vertical direction onto the back of the ear cup in order to connect the internal wires . I 'm really not a very rough user but these things can't take much abuse . Oh and now the fake leather is peeling off the ear cups leaving little black flakes on my shirt . It 's time to buy a new pair of headphones and sorry but it won't be made by Labtec .  
  I was looking for a bag to carry my new SLR ( Nikon D40X ) , yet didn't want the typical tote-look . I wanted something that I could take hiking or skiing or on a motorcycle ride , yet that wouldn't be as big as a normal backpack . This pack does the job , and is roomier than it looks . The modular partitions help to set up the inside just the way you want it , and the whole thing is well designed . Recommended !  
  For the 3 or 4 bucks i spent on theis its a really good buy . Really strudy , looks like it can last quite a while . Just as advertised . Came in a small Ziplock-STYLE bag , no problems there . AS LONG AS IT WORKS AND IS IN PERFECT CONDITION , THATS WHAT I PAY FOR . Arrived as fast as advertised . Said 4-8 days arrived here on the fifth day . Overall , this is the only HDMI cable im buying from now on .  
  I bought these based on a recommendation from a web site that specializes in headphones and headphone amplifiers . Their advice has always been good and was again . These circumaural , closed headphones replaced Sennheiser HD580 ( not HD-140 as originally reported ) headphones that were circumaural , open . This sound evaluation is from the point of view of a classical music listener . The response seems to be pretty much pure , even , and uncolored across the entire audible spectrum . I heard bass down to frequencies that , heard on loudspeakers , you would feel in your whole body , not just your ears . But no headphones can reproduce that effect . The sound seemed at first hearing to be very subtly different than on the old headphones , but the ear adjusts almost immediately to this . My impression is that these are not high-efficiency headphones . You can get adequate , but not impressive sound levels from a CD-player ( I 've tried two different ones ) without a headphone amplifier . I have not tested the headphones with an iPod or iPhone , but I would guess that the amplifier would enhance the results with either of those , or similar , productsThey are very comfortable . After as much as three hours of continuous listening , still no discomfort at all over the head or the ears . The Sennheiser headband caused an itchy scalp after a few hours of use , which the Sony headphones apparently are not going to do . They appear to be constructed very solidly . They fold up quite easily with just a little practice , and seem small enough to be practical on an airplane flight . I have not yet tested whether these will shut out enough aircraft noise to be useful for classical music listening , or whether I will have to use my Etymotic earphones for that purpose . But the coiled cable would serve aircraft use well . ( It also stretches enough [ ten or more feet ] that I can listen to Shostakovich 's 11th Symphony [ a good test for both highs , lows and dynamic range behavior ] on my audio system to confirm the audio response as I write this . ) I don't see how the last two attributes " Takes a beating " or " durable " can be rated until I have used them for several years . But externally , at least , these phones seem well and solidly made , and I don't plan to give them a beating . ( The Sennheiser headphones these replaced failed internally after three years . And I thought they were good , too , also recommended by the same specialist site , but apparently no longer available . In comparison with those , these are more comfortable and don't collect lint and dust as the Sennheiser did . In short , I 'm happy with them and consider them an improvement over what they replaced , and at a lower price to boot .  
  Just as advertized , this product is helping me save money in my cable bill . No more renting , and I own the same type / brand modem without monthly charges . Thank you for your help with this transaction .  
  Working with Windows 8 was my key criteria because my old wireless PCI adapter which was running fine under Windows 7 was consistently dropping connections under Windows 8 . There is no Windows 8 specific driver for this card , but the Windows 7 driver works fine .  
  i call this the lord of the remotes , one remote to rule them all . easy to set up with the online service , then you really can put all the other remotes away . sometimes you do need to push a lot of buttons to get whatever fine tuning done that you need , but you know it is a tiny trade off for the luxury of just one remote to do it all . overall i am very pleased with this purchase .  
  Even though the description says it does , this is a lie , if you are looking for a case for a 17 " laptop skip this one . I had to return it .  
  I purchased the Shure E2c-n SOund Isolating Earhones with high expectations , because I have heard nothing but god things about the Shure brand . I see Shure products at concerts and all over the place so I walked into buying these with a positive outlook . However , I was greatly disappointed when I put them in and realized that they were not only some of the most uncomfortable earphones I have ever worn , but a 15 dollar pair of Skullcandy Ink 'd Buds had better bass response and overall sound isolation . I find this utterly unacceptable from a pair of $ 80-$100 dollar earphones ( depending on where you buy them . ) Of all the provided plastic or foam shroads to best fit a customer 's ear , I had trouble finding the " perfect " fit , Overall , these are not worth the money , because there are better products available for substantially less money . Note : These headphones must be worn with the wire comming out the front of the ear and you must loop it back over the back of the ear for quite possibly the most awkward fit of all time . GOod Luck buying !  
  I recevied the device in good packing kondtion but , when i switch it on and switch it back off i can not restart the device back antel i renstall the battery again . is there and way i can send you back the device for repair or replecment ? please advice  
  My ( ancient ) HP Compaq C502US came with 1 GB SDRAM ; 1/2 GB in each of two slots ( dontcha just hate that ! ) I added 1/2 GB in the usual wasteful way by putting in a 1 GB and throwing away one original 1/2 GB . Recently I decided to fill ' er up , and ordered this Kingston 1 GB boardKingston 1GB PC2-5300 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM Notebook Memory KVR667D2SO / 1GR . I installed it using all standard precautions . bUt this one died a day after I installed it-certainly not Amazon 's fault . Amazon couldn't have made the exchange easier ! The new one installed as easily as the first , and is still holding strong . Kudos to Amazon for their selection and service ; and , well , this is the first time I 've had a Kingston product fail ( I 've used Kingston before ) , so I 'll just chalk it up to experience , and knock a little bit off the stars .  
  I have had these speakers for a while to use with my laptop . I set up a new workstation in the basement and bought a 26in LED flat for the wall above the desk . I hooked up my ps3 and the sound alone was so good i play there more than upstairs on my 50inch plasma and 800watt sony 7.1 system , I also have a bose 3-2-1 in the bedroom , these speakers beat both for modern warfare . I don't know why but when you press the matrix button and the other 3 speakers kick on .. watch out . The surround is supposedly not real true surround but it sure sounds right . I can tell direction on the game better than I can with my turtle beaches with the dss surround on them . I unplugged the headphones and plugged in the green speaker lead into the jack on the DSS module and these speakers went to a new level - these speakers rock so hard for me and I am a true blue geel level gamer with more high end toys than I can afford . These speakers are better than the newer digital logitechs and can be had for like $ 50 on ebay while the new digital logitechs are like $ 400 - these speakers are awesome and then some .  
  The Nikon Binocs were not a disappointment . However , the straps were just o . k . and the lens covers kept falling off the straps , which were supposed to hold them .  
  I have purchased several of these HDMI cable , for under $ 2 each and they work great , I cant tell the differance between the $ 1.69cable and the $ 20.00 cables . I love them .  
  If you leave this machine unattended for a few days , you might come back to find that the memory is loaded with unwanted , junk FAXes that can ONLY be deleted by printing them . Hitting the stop button or even unplugging the machine will NOT erase the memory . In the day and age when junk FAXes are so prolific , one would think HP would have the foresight to offer a solution . ( Keeping the machine connected to a computer and previewing every FAX is not a reasonable solution . )  
  I bought the camera about 3 months ago and everything was great . I previously owned a Nikon SLR and had no doubt this was going to be a quality product . The 880 was too small for my husband 's big hands and the 990 was little more camera than we needed . Unfortunately after two months of use , all the photos taken in automatic mode were underexposed . I called Nikon tech support and they walked me through a couple of things to try but nothing worked . I found the tech support people to be undertrained and I knew more about the camera than some of them ( pretty bad considering you drill down to the specific " Coolpix 950 support " through the automated phone menu ) . One support person blamed the 64MB Viking compact flash card on my problems , saying they only support Lexar ( brand that comes with the camera ) or SanDisk , and that Viking " is known to cause problems " with the Coolpix 950 ! I have read many reviews and never heard of this problem ! I called Viking and they had no knowledge of any incompatability with the 950 . Eventually Nikon replaced the strobe light under warranty but it 's still got the same underexposure problem . To their credit , Nikon paid for my camera to be returned to them for a second time . I am waiting to receive my camera back . I still like Nikon unfortunately all the hospital pictures when I gave birth to my son are now sitting on my hard drive and every photo is underexposed .  
  I love this radio . I bought one for myself ( blue ) , one for my daughter ( purple ) , and one for my son ( black ) . This radio / CD Player / Clock does everything I want . I especially like the sleep time feature . I can set to play a CD for a specific time , and it will go off by itself . I wonder why they stopped making it in the colors . I bought the first three last year , and now I bought another black one to put in my kitchen . The blue one is in my bedroom where I can start a CD , time it for 90 or 60 or less minutes , and it will go off by itself when I fall asleep . Another good feature , which the description didn't state , is that it has an outlet to plug in earphones .  
  If you could fortunately buy RICOHJPN ID ones , it is the best . But if you unfortunately got CMC MAG-F01-00 labels , you will also got many bad coasters . Good luck . You can search DVDidentifier to check what your DVD IDs are . DON'T BE FOOLED . Check beore you buy ! RICOHJPN THE BEST !  
  For just a few pieces of cheap looking plastic , this item is way overpriced . I have not tried them yet but they don't look very durable to me . For travelling purpose , these devices will break easily .  
  Please do not buy this filter . It gives terrible flare to the photograph in the night . Works good in the day time . Try hoya . Just 10 dollar more than this item .  
  Just got my monitor . I like it in general , but it arrived with one dead pixel . Since amazon seems to have discontinued the product , the only alternative is to try my luck with the manufacturer . ( .. )  
  I love my e740 , but I hated the battery . I was learning how to adjust , shortening online time , keepingthe thing plugged in overnight , all the while hating it . The unit is the first and best of its kind , with that one smallexception , length of battery . Finally , I took the plunge andfixed my e740 . With this battery , all the toys including wifilast more than 6 hours before needing a recharge . If Iconserve , easily 12 hours of use before I have to plug in . This isthe missing element . Finally , my keyboard , my modem , the wifi , my SD memory , all of those investments are worththat much more . Don't hold out , get this accessory , ittruely makes the e740 that much more indispensable .  
  One of the few replacements for opaque top , indirect lighting torchieres with high wattage circline bulbs , and has a fancy finish justifying price . However , the common 26W spiral 5 " cfl bulbs will only fit three into this as made ( see below ) , as to fit two facing each other a specialty low profile or squat format bulb is used probably made just for this lamp , and may not be available long term . It could be found at only two dealers - compared to GE flat 55W 2D 's available in storefronts . These low profile spirals are available from the lamp dealer similar in price to the longer , 5 " bulbs , but another distributor charges three times that . Oddly regular bulbs would fit were the sockets on one side repositioned and angled towards the side - the brackets are screwed in , just some small holes needed . The shorter and fatter squat bulbs have slightly shorter tubes with 1600 lumens instead of 1700-1800 for regular . All these spiral bulbs seem less efficient than the GE 2D 55W and circline bulbs , rated 4000 lumens . These seemede just as bright as this 6400 lumen 4 spiral set , but no light meter used . Maybe some light inside these spirals is wasted , certainly doesn't shine out directly , compared to flat shapes - not clear how output gets measured . Customers who really like this lamp 's looks might want to get a dozen spare bulbs with it while available . Such lamps with specialty circline bulbs have been discontinued after a few years in the past . An advantage of the spirals , though , is they are available in high temp rating sunlight , daylight color when wanted ( though not the squat ones ) . There might be some of the GE bulbs that way , though , needs checking .  
  The product didn't have good dimensions stated in the description , so I went with the assumption that it was linked to the camera I was buying it must be the right bag . I was right . I bought a Kodak easyshare z1012 which is a bigger camera than the pocket point & shoot but it fit fine once I got the angle right . The extra zippered space on the bottom is perfect for batteries & SD cards & even some ID if you 're stretched for space . It is small enough to be unobtrusive but still keep the camera safe with its extra padding . The belt loop is vecroed so you don't have to strip off the belt to thread it through . Works well & I am pleased .  
  This is a nice high quality lens from Nikon at a very budget minded price . I am amazed at the amout of light that this lens lets through compared to my lenses at f 3.5 or higher . Great depth of field on the lens as well . I am a beginner at photography as you may be able to tell by this review . This type of lens was recommended to me by another more advanced photographer as a great lens to learn the functions of the camera without having to play with zoom . It makes me consider the subject matter I am shooting more than the typical point and shoot that I did in the past . Great Lens !  
  I am going to return this item . I was even inclided to mark the product as defective when choosing the return reasons . This product is really bad at : 1 ) The GPS continues to lose signal . Even if I have updated the GPS firmware accordingly to the company 's website . In many open places , it took more than 3-5 minutes to get a satellite fix and then it lost soon . 2 ) I am in New Jersey , however , the address of my doctor can't be found in the map . 3 ) Most amazingly , the car cigratte ligher adaptor cannot be fit into the GPS backpack . After contacting the NAVMAN support , the guy asked me to buy another IPAQ accessary separately . I just wonder , had they tried it before they made this product ? 4 ) The customer support of NAVMAN is really bad . I sent email to them and wait for almst a week and couldn't get a response . Calling their phone get me an answer , though the guy was not very patient . Wang  
  I got this tv just before christmas 2006 . I got it from circuit city for $ 1299 + tax ( after asking them to do a price match with fry 's ) . I also had a $ 100 cupon of circuit city so i ended up paying $ 1199 + tax = $ 1330 for this brand new TV . It is fantastic . Setup is very simple . Colors are very bright but one problem that i face is with dark scenes . Dark scenes look very dark on this tv . but besides that the tv is excellent . I had to get monster cable to make DVD signal look richer on the television . Two thumbs up for this tv .  
  Although they are manufactured by CMC , which has a poor reputation with some folks , these are the finest 16x blank DVDs I have found for the price at Amazon . I paid $ 39.99 for 100 with free shipping , and have burned almost 100 with zero defects . The light gray top surface leaves as much room as possible for writing on with a marker , too ( Imation DVDs , also made by CMC , are terrible in this respect , and no other brand I have tried is as good ) . To see who manufactured your blank DVDs , try DVD Identifier freeware from $U$  
  I ordered a sigma lens the same time I ordered the filterand the wrong size filter arrived 52mm instead of 58mm the lens size for the filterI sent it back and they credited my account . need to tighten up QC double check your order before clicking on it  
  While the optics of this scope are good , there are quite a few bad things about this telescope . The tripod is shaky , unstable and cheaply produced . The finder scope is flimsy and almost unusable . The users manual that comes with this scope is not written for beginners . Important topics such as balancing the telescope , polar alignment and collimation ( aligning the mirrors ) are glossed over and totally unsuitable for a beginner . I would recommend spending the extra money to buy an Orion Spaceprobe 3 or SPaceprobe 130 .  
  the battery to the navigation is completely dead . The touch screen doesnt even work that well . the price for this is beyond way to much . i should get a refund but i cant because i lost all the information to this product .  
  Do not buy this made in China product ! After using it for 3 months , it stopped reading disks , saying that they needed to be formatted . When I tried formatting them , it would say it could not complete the format . So I tested out the disks on another computer , and they worked fine . There is no warranty , and it 's past Amazon 's return period . Waste of $ 20 !  
  I received my protector in plenty of time , but I am having issues with it . I tried 2 times to reach customer service , no contact has been made . This company has not made any attempt to reach me . At this time I would not buy from them again , which is a shame since they appear to have a nice selection of items . I just would not want to go through with an order and if I had issues with it , then not be able to get help with it later .  
  This didn't work . The picture kept going in and out ( I tried using multiple player devices and various dvd 's and streaming websites ) . I returned this and picked up a decent cable at the store that works perfectly .  
  I ordered this product to give to my mother for mother 's Day . She got it on time . Now As of June 13,2000 the modem is no longer working . It simply won't connect . There is some type of error and won't accept commands .  
  Can't get the contrast or printing right . Manual / help is not user friendly . I 'm afraid to call hp , they 'll probably charge me an arm for tech support . I suppose will be worth it once I get it worked out , need a lightscribe for dummies book .  
  I ordered this since I am moving away to college in the fall and I got myself the Logitech Notebook Pro which is a thousand times better . The picture quality is ridiculous and whenever I took a picture my computer crashed ! I am returning this immediately !  
  The camera case is just large enough to hold the camera . But you will probably want room for your SD card , spare batteries , the data transfer cord , and possibly other things . This case will pretty much only hold the camera . I suggest taking your new camera to a few retailers and inspecting the goods in person . You may also find the prices more to your liking than buying Canon-branded accessories .  
  The USB port connection at the point of the External Drive is loose , and connectivity to the external CD-RW drive is frequently lost . I probably will never purchase another Targus product .  
  23 years of Army service and 4 Suunto watches . Cheap G-Shock watches have lasted much much longer ! I have had to replace 5 bands all in the period of 4 -5 months . I have had 3 of the 4 Suunto 's shut down in less the 30 feet of water . ( Suunto claims they are water resistant to 80 meters on thier advertising however when you return them after they stop working in less then 10 meters they claim the warranty does not cover swimming . Hmm swimmers and divers usually look at the water resitance of a watch to mean they are water resitant while swimming . Unless I am messed up and doing it wrong .. do most people wear the watch on thier wrist or do they just drop it down in the water and go back to check to see how deep it is or how much time they have spent in the water . Anyway , enough ranting on a cheaply made but exspensive watch that the company does not care enough about it 's customers to replace or fix it under warranty . Thanks Suunto .. G-shock has won my service back . Suunto Core Wrist-Top Computer Watch with Altimeter , Barometer , Compass , and Depth Measurement  
  the color was acceptable , however the size was not fit enough . Therefore , the camera case will look not elegant as I thought .  
  We have had this camera for only about 4 months and have used it sparingly since it is my husband 's camera for use at work in case they need a photo of something . It is already broken . The lens won't extend and open when you turn it on - thus impossible to use . When you turn it off , the lens opens up . It is not worth even $ 99.00 . How disappointing in this day of digital cameras that HP can't come up with something a little better than a disposable camera from the supermarket .  
  I thought it was worth a shot because of the price .. the picture is horrible though , lots of snow . Hundreds of tiny flickering white dots really messes up the ambiance .  
  I , like many others , though I was getting a deal for this battery grip at only $ 69.95 ( compared to the Canon grip which sells for over $ 130 here on Amazon ) . When I first received it , I was impressed by how well it fit my Canon Rebel XT , how sturdy it felt , and its general appearance . It worked perfectly for about 6 months until one day when the plastic surrounding the battery 's compartment 's switch crumbled , leaving me unable to close the battery door which rendered the grip useless . I am not a heavy camera user ; I use my camera about once every week or so , and never in extreme heat or conditions . I 'm always very careful with it and its accessories so there was no manhandling on my part . This grip is simply cheap and is made of weaker materials than that of the Canon grip . Now I 'm having to go through the trouble of begging for a replacement . Yes , the technical details state that there is a 1 year warranty for this item , but a warranty card is NOT included with the grip . Opteka won't answer my inquiries so now I have to plead with 47th St Photo to honor the warranty . In summation , you get what you pay for . Save yourself the trouble and get the Canon grip . It 's pricier but worth it .  
  The binder of the case is not wide enough to hold a full load of cds . I filled the case about 1/2 full and could barely fit in cds closest to the binder , because it 's too tight . At 3/4 full the cds get bowed when you squeeze them in . Don't buy it .  
  This wasn't worth what I paid for it , and I had free shipping on it . It 's decent if you don't use it much , but I frequently use this item when I jog or in my pickup because it doesn't not have an onboard CD player . The headphones with it are horrible , and the little plastic window over the CD comes out if you aren't careful with it . The skip protection is decent , and the AM / FM digital tuner has decent range of reception . Overall , it 's not a very good product .  
  I bought this to replace a fully functional WiFi Rtr to leverage its N-capability . 15 months down the line , here is my summary : Positives : + Good signal strength + Ability to work in mixed-mode + Steady signal , as seen by using NetStumblerCould-be-better : + - Advanced parental control for limiting access to the Internet based on time and sites requires experimenting , the documentation is really in need of a rewrite + - Access log for websites is not user friendlyDefinitely-needs-improvement : - The router fails to allocate an IP address to computers every 3-4 days , even after a static IP assignment on the intranet . Only recourse is to reboot the DIR 615 in my experience - Rebooting requires pulling the power , a simple power cycle button would have helped - The existing reset button on the back wipes the router settings clean ! Can't use it to address the IP address allocation problem - Lots of DNS lookup issues , search and you will find these posted , but nothing seems to have worked for me so far - Recently , the devices connected to this router have started showing excellent connectivity and existence of an IP address , but the access fails - When the access fails , sometimes , browsers time out and complain . At other times , the requested web page appears without images , or the page structure appears to be mutilated . I bought it from a Black Friday sale for twenty dollars , and I think I am back to the drawing board , as I do not like to frequently pull the power to reboot the device .  
  I had to return these cables . The cables just wouldn't work . I was totally unimpressed with these cables , they were so were very thin and cheap looking .  
  I ordered this card for my camcorder to tape my daughters first birthday party . It was ordered a full month before the party but I never received it . I emailed amazon , they said they would ship another , i never saw a new order or any flash card . Thanks amazon ! Now customer no-service is telling my the replacement order was shipped over 2 weeks ago but it was not received either . I have order thousands of dollars worth of products from amazon and now they are going to loose a customer because of a 15 $ memory card .  
  I bought this as a gift on 19 June and was given on 8 JUly . Within 2 weeks the device developed a fault , using the web help service did not cure the problem despite 3 attempts . Finally the device failed totally and is not of merchantable quality . Both Amazon and the ' third party vendor declined to accept any responsibility for it . So we contacted Archos , who after much correspondence issued an RMA . The device was sent immediately , but it took a week to arrive in France . It has been sitting on a shelf for daysThe whole procedure clumsy and ineffecient . I have e-mailed the CEO bringing this to his attention but no reply after some days .  
  The backpack functionality is very nice , but the laptop part is not , especially if you have a 17 " laptop . This pack was used to carry a 17 " HP laptop and the sleeve tore during just a couple uses . This bag might have lasted if it was used on a 15 " laptop . I will not purchase another like this .  
  Be aware - This device will expand the distance away from the router / AP you can go and that is it . It will not help the problem with loss of speed due to increased distance from the router . You lose connection speed as you get farther from the router / AP as we all know . This device will not help that problem , it will simply expand the range of the speed available where the expander is placed . IF the range expander is placed at the edge of the reception area as recommended in the install guide it will connect to the router / AP at the slow connection speed available in that location and then expand THAT slower speed . It may actually slow down your connection if your laptop is between the expander and the router / AP . You can speed it up by moving the expander closer to the router / AP , it will then expand the connection speed available from THAT new location but this then decreases your overall range . Tradeoff but no perfect solution . It also took days and many , many phone calls to tech support to get this to work including firmware upgrades to both , endless reconfiguring and trying different settings on both the router and expander . For a day of two the whole network was dead while the linksys guys tried various things / settings . VERY , VERY tough to get going .. Not really worth it in the long run . After a few more days of use I rerate this product with zero stars . I would definitely not buy again and am returning this one . The new problem that I have found is that the expander is very touchy about where you are relative to your router / AP and the laptop . If your laptop is between the router and the expander you will have major problems , constant loss of connectivity , it freaks because there are two equal strength signals . I had to set it up as two different networks and choose manually which one to use at any given location , otherwise it quit working repeatedly . This is ridiculous to say the least . I had to keep moving the expander to the room I was in to get a strong enough signal for it to clearly be dominant and then manually choose which two sources of the same network to use . No this is not a PC problem , the linksys guys confirmed . Bugs , poor design , compatability problems with itself and the routers / APs it is supposed to support . Not at all as expected or as needed , more trouble than worth even after I got it configed correctly ( which took days on the phone with the linksys guys )  
  Doesn't work on my mac laptop ( cursor keeps bouncing around and getting stuck ) . NOT usable ! Did not have the same prob w / Microsoft Wheel Mouse . Get a better mouse than this !  
  I do not know if the binoculars I received were faulty , but this Russian made product has such poor performance that it doesn't serve any purpose . These binoculars cannot be properly focussed and the clarity is nonexistant .  
  The remote worked out of the box but not long enough for me to set it up . Logitech is replacing the remote but it will take 10 to 14 days . We 'll see what happens with the new one .  
  Works ok for now but the cord is very flimsy and cheap . I don't think I will get too much use out of it .  
  I use MP3 players for jogging , when my Rio 500 quit I bought this . Pluses : excellent sound quality and the main unit controls are very easy to access by feel while jogging . It has an armband but I dislike armbands ( personal pref ) . Minuses : the beltclip is really dumb , a thin flat metal oval with a screw at one end that attaches the clip BELOW the top of the back of the unit . The clip is very hard to pry open to slide onto your waist , it easily rotates around the screw unless you screw it on VERY tightly , it covers the battery compartment so if you DO screw it on tightly you 're in trouble when you need to change batteries , and it doesn't extend long enough below the screw to securely hold the unit . Since the clip is not attached to the TOP of the back of the unit , the unit doesn't hang flat to your side ; the top leans out and easily catches onto something and pops off you . The handheld remote has a very tiny LCD screen whereas the main unit has none . I hate carrying a remote in my hand while I 'm jogging so I never use it . Also , I 've had VERY bad problems with an occasional blast of static at FULL VOLUME between songs , VERY bad for the ears . It 's not due to the music or headphones , both which worked fine on my last player , and it 's not static electricity because it ONLY happens between songs at the start of the next song . The included software wouldn't install because I already had an MP3 player on my system , and once I did get it installed it wouldn't work ( Windows violation ) , I had to download another version . Took me four hours to get the software to where I could download . And for some peculiar reason , it locks up when I download one specific song ( Dire Straits " Tunnel of Love " ) . At this point , I 'm looking for another player .  
  Bought it , hooked it up , wow ! Great ! The commercials aren't blasting us out of our chairs anymore . After two or three days , I seem to be right back where I was before hooking this thing up . The HD channels are whisper quiet , the commercials blast out at 2 - 3 times normal volume . Obviously , this unit has quit working . As one poster said & quot ; Use a good power strip & quot ; - heck , this is hooked up to a UPS ; surges weren't the problem . I 'd say poor quality components and bad design .  
  In general i guess is ok , the only problems it has is when you try to print pictures from a memory card it takes like 30 minutes of thinking before it actually shows the pictures in the screen , also i know everybody complains about the ink but in this case i ran out of the 3 color cartridige ink after i used 4 times to print letters in black only and two of then where in draft mode ( i din't print a full color picture ) , after 4 prints thats it i need more ink . another thing is that it dosen't have a lot of options to choose from .  
  I enjoyed The Secret History and The Little Friend , but they share the same weaknesses . The story-telling is rich with emotional detail , but it takes a large part of the book , which is an exceedingly long book , to get to any real action . And the ends of both books are a bit of a let-down . It seems the author didn't quite know where to go , so she just stopped . Two breaking points for me . 1 ) The death toll of abused animals-can anyone write a " serious " novel without a pile of road kill anymore ? 2 ) Editing-there is a reason that good editors exist . They make art better for curbing the author 's often irresistable need to fill up pages with words . Telling a well-written tale includes a healthy sense of self-restraint . An author that can edit themself is truly a gift to readers everywhere .  
  The PC version works ok but if you own a Mac , you are out of luck . Major glitches of very basic uses ( such as unable to upload waypoints from a spreadsheet to your GPS ! Both upload and download buttons and pulldowns send you to a download only option ) . It is one of the few Mac apps that will lock down your computer and not respond to force quit . The interface is bizarre . Want to find a place ? - go to " Edit " . Want to find a coordinate ? - go to " View " . Want to find customer support ? - go to the back of the room . iMac 2.4 ghz OS 10.5.4 , Topo 4.5.0  
  I once thought this was a great camcorder for all the reasons already noted . Great video and audio quality , easy to use , good price . But guess what ? It 's broken and out of warranty , and in order to even get a quote on the cost to fix it , I must send it to Sony , because Sony doesn't allow anyone but Sony repair their cameras any more . So , instead of going to one of the hundreds of capable and convenient repair shops in Denver , where I can get an estimate and repairs fast , I have to mail my camera to Texas . TEXAS ! So what 's wrong with it ? The camera refuses to properly load any miniDV tapes now - I get an error that says " Reload tape " and the error message won't go away no matter how many times I reload the tape . Apparently this is a common failure , a quick google search shows this same problem in discussion threads all over the net . And , believe it or not , the most common suggestion to fix this error is to smack the camera repeatedly on the side to " unstick " a stuck part . This did not work with my camera , but good luck to you if you buy this piece of junk . This is the last Sony I will ever purchase . Been burned too many times by Sony now - a TV , a PDA , a digital camera , and now this . I 'm buying a Panasonic PV-GS80 miniDV Camcorder to replace this doorstop . I bought an Olympus 790SW camera to replace my broken Cybershot , and it works great . I should have learned my lesson by now , but I 'm brand-loyal to a fault . Sony pushed me too far this time . No more Sony . Never again .  
  I have bought several routers in the past , 3Com , Buffalo , and a few others . This is the first and probably the last Linksys . the firmwear that came with the router was unusable . Upgrading to the latest improved things a lot . I can get most things working now . WPA works , the VPN works mostly . UPnP works OK . On the down side you can't mix WEP and WPA which you can on my other routers , also you can't allocate fixed DHCP to partcular MAC adresses , you have to allocate the machines a fixed IP address , not possible on our laptops . Worst of all , is that we can crash the router from the Internet side with our development software ! ( It doesn't crash our other routers ) . This is in the current Firmware revision . This is unforgivable . Avoid !  
  I finished using one cartridge a couple weeks after I bought the product . It yielded a lot less than 2500 pages like it claims .  
  The tape was less than 1.75 " , not 2 " . But the most annoying aspect of the tape was the weak adhesive . I used to work in A / V. Good gaffers tape is absolutely necessary if you want to do a good job , and want the tape to stick for more than 2 minutes . Good gaffers tape sticks to just about anything , but doesn't take much effort to remove , and doesn't leave residue . This tape actually doesn't leave residue because it doesn't stick . I took a chance on this tape instead of the tape I know is good , but more expensive . The adhesive is so weak on this tape it won't stick to plastic , metal , or even the back of itself . I returned it immediately , and fortunately got a full credit , since it is misrepresented .  
  I can see no reason that Canon charges so much for the replacement toner cartridges and drum . I paid $ 600 for a printer 18 months ago and since then have spent that much replacing the drum and the toner cartridges . Also , Canon has some ' chip ' in the cartridge that when it is low throws out an ' alarm ' and will not let you print in color-is that cheesy or what ?  
  I was excited to try this product for my DirecTV DVR connection without having to install another phone jack . Simply put , it didn't work . Then when I tried to use it for a regular phone ( both cordless and corded ) , there was so much static that you couldn't have a conversation . I was very disappointed . It appeared , for me , this product was too good to be true .  
  my sister purchased this for her and I in Nov , 1999 for my birthday , up to this date , neither of us have been able to use ! After days and hours of searching sites and etc . , I came across the fact that this unit WILL NOT HAVE ANY VOICE with a COMPAQ computer ! I contacted the company on numerous occasions , they have ignored ALL ! I told them I was even going to return if they didn't respond , they didn't care . So I am returning . I do not recommend this unit also terrible picture and very small in size .  
  These binoculars are horrible . First off , the software is way too complex ( and I am a software engineer so I know it doesn't need to be that way ) . My dad , who is good with computers , couldn't even get the pictures off the camera . And of course the ONLY way to get the pictures of the camera is through the Roxio software ( i.e no way of browising to the pictures ) . But the worst thing is the picture quality . The picture my dad took of deer were all dark and blurry . I thought maybe it was him taking pictures wrong , so I took some pictures at my well-lit workplace . COMPLETE GARBAGE ! So , If you buy this after reading this review then I think that you and these binoculars are a perfect match . BTW , I have the camera binoculars from Simmons , which are not that great , but at least they are functional , which is light years ahead of these Bushnell ones .  
  These sound great and stay in place but are very uncomfortable . I would not buy again !  
  The remote works well when it works . It is difficult to charge and keep on the base correctly . It constantly beeps when it is out of alignment and begins to lose it 's charge . I believe that this is a frequent complaint .  
  This is a great little camera but the price here is INSANE . It 's only $ 39.99 at Target .  
  The is a poorly designed accessory . I bought the Delkin Devices LCD COVER PRO SNAP FUJI S3 ( DFS3-P ) and it constantly fell of the camera . I even applied a small amount of glue on the eye cup and it still fell out . I will not buy it again and do not recommend this product . It is a piece of junk .  
  I did not like recorder at all ! You could not rewind and record over things and if you hit stop , you could not continue on in the same file . It was frustrating and I didn't like it at all .  
  We 've had a Belkin transmitter in the past but this one was just awful ! You never get quality sound out of this thing .. it doesn't matter which station you put it on . It just doesn't work without fuzz in the background ! :(  
  Just finished this one . Let 's just say that after reading 625 pages of a novel where the little boy gets murdered on page 1 , it 's hugely disappointing and appallingly cheap not to FINISH THE STORY and let the readers know who committed the crime . I would have given this 1 star , but Tartt is a good writer and having grown up in the South I thought her dialog was true-to-life . Otherwise , don't waste your time . I also agree that the book would benefit from some serious editing . How many descriptions of the trees do we really need ?  
  This printer was a gift ( and I am grateful for the thoughtfulness ) , but darn it , if you 're looking for a great deal , this one isn't it . 1 . every time it prints , it cleans the printer heads , wasting ink . 2 . it goes through ink quickly and you can't just keep on printing if one it out . Nope , it has to be replaced . 3 . You can't op NOT to print in color on the printers menu . 4 . Replacing 6 cartridges costs more that the printer did . I wasn't very impressed with the quality of the images it produced . I still love my Deskjet , and we 've been using that instead . The one thing I do like about it , is that it feeds small items better .  
  I bought the Nextar P7 . but aside from its large screen it had so many serious drawbacks , I returned it and got a Plenio VXA-3000 which also has a 7 " display but is far superior in just about every way ! Some of the P7 's problems : It takes about a minute to start up . It takes another minute or so to lock into a 3D signal . In contrast , the Plenio starts in under 10 seconds , and is locked into a 3D signal in about another 10 seconds . Once started , a woman 's voice keeps repeating " Acquiring GPS Signal " even though lots of satellites are already being tracked . The unit may have two million points of interest , such as gas stations and hotels , but I could only access them in alphabetical order , instead of distance order . I wanted to know where the nearest gas station was , not that there 's an Arco station on Atlantic Ave ( when I was about 12 miles from Atlantic Ave ) ! On my next trip with it , I couldn't get it to re-adjust the given route ( i.e. , forcing it to re-route me to my destination ) . The route it wanted me to take was imposible due to road-work ! There were many other problems with this unit , but to ' cut to the chase ' , look elsewhere ! If you want a 7 " display , checkout the far superior Plenio VXA-3000 . Btw , while you can order the Plenio VXA-3000 on Amazon , unfortunately it 's shipped from TigerDirect which adds about $ 20 shipping !  
  Great concept here with extremely poor craftsmanship ! The Good - makes watching and switching between all of your AV stuff very easy . The BAD - ( 1 ) the cradle charger is junk . It will work fine for a couple of months and then it will slowly begin to fail on you and not charge the remote anymore . Just do a quick ' google ' search on the harmony 880 recharging cradle and you will see pages of consumers who have had this problem . To make matters worse , despite that this was acknowledged as a design flaw the company still charged me to buy another cradle which is not also beginning to fail . ( 2 ) Still grasping some loyalty to this remote I decided to add another device to it only to have the USB attachment break on it . I have had enough and would not buy another one of these due to terrible construction of them . So , if you have one , enjoy it while it works . I know that I did .  
  I bought two of the product with intention of networking my XP laptop to my wifes Win98 PC . I give Netgear the merit of having decent customer support . They got the product to work .. at the expense of all other network connections . Since I installed the product , I had to reinstall Win XP Home Edition twice , after countless errors . Also , my wife 's Win 98SE was not able to recognize her printer since the install of the network . I uninstalled the product from both computers . Thank God my laptop is fine ( after the reinstall and loss of info ) . My wifes PC STILL has problems with finding the printer . I dont recommend this product to anyone ..  
  These Kodak Cameras only produce The quick time videos , which is an Apple Product and does not work with Windows Movie Maker . So I can not download to Youtube . Very dissappointing !  
  I am using my Harmony 880 to control a bedroom set-up composed of circa 2005 - 2006 components , all of which were recognized by the Harmony software . The remote cannot change the input on my tv by itself from the activity selector , because selecting the correct input requires one to press the right arrow button instead of the select button . This makes the activity buttons insufficient to get me to any activity . I have to go into the tv device and manually set the input . There also is no dedicated button for accessing recorded content on a dvr , so I have to go into that device 's menu as well to get a program to playback . No big deal , unless I want to change the volume . I set up the remote to turn volume up or down on the tv when those buttons are pressed , but , it turns out , once you go into the dvr device menus , the remote forgets that you are using the dvr with speakers that are controlled through a different device . So , back into the tv I go . Until it 's time to change the channel . This device has been discontinued , but there are still plenty of them out there . I recommend you buy something newer with a dedicated dvr button .  
  This remote is a good value , but the glacial speed of the programming software is unbelievable . To make a minor adjustment , is an easy 10-20 minute waste of time . My story : I bought one of these about a year ago . It took several hours to get setup for a fairly simple system . TV , receiver , DVD , cable box and three zWave lights . However I was pleased with the performance , if not the dismal display that was harder than expected to read . But it was useable , and filled the need . Then about 3 months ago , the remote started to fall apart . The buttons near the # 3 wouldn't work most of the time , and the toggle in the middle fell off , and after numerous attempts to reattach , it finally got lost somewhere in a reclining chair . The Monster support team was challenging to get through to , but eventually said they would cover it under warranty , though I should expect to get a " refurbished " one back , since they no longer make these . The quote was " send it to us , and we will try to dig something up in the warehouse . " I did this , and after a couple of weeks , a replacement in a zip lock sandwich bag was returned to me . This has been a royal pain , since it doesn't seem to want to communicate with the RF repeater . Add to this that the software is unbelievably slow to work with , and you end up with an entirely frustrating experience . Honestly the software had to be designed by someone that never had to use it as a user . It probably works well in their development environment , but try to use it over the internet , like they require , and it is just not worth it . I say , find something else , because this is just not fun . And since it is no longer something that Monster seems to be pushing , I don't see anything improving any time soon .  
  I cannot adjust the record speed on the drive , the Nero software that came with the drive will not work with my pre-existing software , and the support from the Philips website does not exist for my problem !  
  Rip off . I would not buy again . What you get with the points is downloadable crap . Do not buy . To expensive .  
  Just got off the phone with Thompson ( RCA ) customer service . Unit failed after three weeks . Now boots to " File System Corrupt " . Computer doesn't recognize it . It 's useless . Warranty says 90 days parts and labor - 1 year parts . So when I call CSR , they tell me it 's going to cost $ 50 labor to send me the replacement unit ! Even though the PARTS are covered , apparently the labor to pack a replacement and put a computer label on a box and call UPS will equate to $ 50 . Not in my book ! Besides - on the internet there are several sites which discuss that this unit is known to fail and be un-repairable . What a gimmick to get extra money out of consumers !  
  The Konica Minolta cartridge I received from Laser and Copy Supply had been refilled with a cheap brand toner . When I tried to print some labels using it , it acted like glue , pulled a label off and stuck it in my printer . I had to take the printer apart to get the label out . I am still seeing smearing of toner from time to time . The cartridge does work printing text on copy paper . UPDATE : When Laser and Copy Supply found out that the cartridge was refilled , they sent me a message saying they only intend to sell new cartridges , apologized for the mistake , and refunded my money without my asking for it . They even offered to send me a new cartridge free of charge . They intend to please .  
  I have and still use this product , but the problems with it are serious for the non-technical user and technical user alike . There are problems with the firmware and the DHCP on the WAN side ( for those who don't know , if you get your IP assigned to you on the fly by your ISP when you log in , you 're getting a Dynamic IP using DHCP . ) It will cease to update properly after a few days . The only way to fix this is to reset the router either by powering it off and on , or by forcing a soft boot of the router . Neither is a good option . The VPN software will work with XP & Win2k but only if you have a static IP to go to . This too is a firmware problem . Also the event logging and SMNP reporting ceases to perform after only a couple hours at most . The Linksys service people will not acknowledge there is a problem unless you point to the Broadband webside and all the regularly reported problems from others . Their immediate response is that it must be you or that specific box ( it 's not , it 's the firmware ) . I got this router because I 'd had good experience previously from Linksys . Their other products are decent , but this one is heading towards the lemon pile fast . I AM connecting still using this product , and the features for port triggering and other aspects of the products features do work , but I had to do a dramatic workaround to make one of my computers force a reset every 8 hours to keep it working all the time . Look at other products first .  
  I looked forward to getting this so that I might transfer all my LPS to CDs . I did , fairly easily , but the quality of the finished product was horrible . I could listen to my LPS fairly painlessly , kept meaning to hook up another speaker , but I have now discovered that the CD drawer no longer opens , nor does the turntable turn . So , I guess I 'll throw it out . This was way too expensive to end up like this .  
  the radio dident work out the box , the cd motor was not working . i never heard a sound from the radio , i returned immediatly , i got the jwin radio ( jx-cd573d ) which i ordered off of amazon and i use now . do not buy this coby radio save your money  
  This cable stopped working after I plugged it in to test it , once . I used it to attach a mobile mic to my camera . however , after putting it away after the first test , it started making a very loud humming noise . So loud nothing else but yells could be heard . Don't buy , too many people had the same experience for this one to be a single lemon . Go with a different brand .  
  I was surprised at the poor construction of this case . The holes drilled for screws to hold the hard drive bracket in place do not line up to the bracket itself . There are flimsy little plastic clips that broke of when I was inserting the HD . However the HD works . I am looking for a new case to enclose my HD .  
  I do not have the CX5400 , but do own the CX4600 and experience the same printer cartridge clogging problems as many of the other commenters . I have also received a second printer from Epson and after about a year , here we go again . Tried head cleaning over and over and of course am about out of ink again . Still .. no success . Cannot print anything in black ink . I was told by Epson the first time that I shouldn't leave the printer on ( someone else had also written that ) so .. got the replacement and religiously turn it off after each use . Still .. no printing again after another year . I am currently researching printers for a replacement that 's how I came upon this site .  
  when this little camera works , it works well . The pictures are acceptable quality , and it 's a handy size to tote around anywhere . Unfortunately , HP totally missed the quality-control boat on this one . My first one had a defective shutter . The replacement eats batteries , I don't get even an hour 's use on lithium batteries . The bundled software isn't much to write home about either - it 's not well-organized , and takes too many steps to do simple tasks like sort and delete batches of photos , and select photos for editing .  
  I bought an Alpine 9847 and the Ipod interface . I works but it totally hijacks your Ipod . The beautiful intuitve , fast controls on the Ipod itself are locked out and you can ONLY control the Ipod from the car stereo . It is therefore very hard to deal with especially if you have a large music catalog on you Ipod . It is very slow , not at all intuitive . Even after getting used to it it is no good . The info on artist , album or song title imports from the IPod very slowly . Turning the volume knob is equivalent to circling on the Ipod but one turn eqauls about 3 spots on the list unlike one circle on the Ipod which equals dozens of spots on the list . Therefore if you have a large catalog you have to spin the volume knob 100 times to get thru a long catalog list which takes forever .. Very annoying , very slow , very cumbersome . If only it did not deactivate the normal controls on the Ipod itself . A better and much cheaper solution is to find a car stereo with some form of line in , either stereo mini plug or RCA jacks . The just connect directly and use the IPods own controls which are infinitely better . I replace an old stereo to get the Ipod option and am very sorry I did so .  
  Buyer Beware ! I have a WRE54G range extender that is less than one year old . I just bought a brand new Linksys WRT54G router , thinking they would seemlessly work together since they are both Linksys products . After an hour on the phone with Linksys customer service , I was told the range expander is compatible only up to version 4 of the router . I had purchased a brand new version 5 , meaning I needed to DOWNGRADE the router in order to use the range expander . Customer service told me to return the new router , gave me a barcode number for the old version 4 router , told me to search local stores by reading barcodes on each box I could find , and good luck .. I might , just might , get lucky . Version 1 of the range extender does NOT have an ethernet jack . Version 2 apparently does , making it easier to connect to the extender 's utilities . However , there are loads of compatibility problems between various routers and range extender combinations , and the technical explanations are very dense . Make sure you are educated on the subject , and for best results , get a doctorate in computer science or engineering before you buy . Oh , and don't ask about the problems I had connecting the Linksys WVC54G webcam to the Linksys router .. I have already spent 3 1/2 hours on the phone with customer support with no solution in sight . Linksys has HORRIBLE support .  
  I bought these because they were cheap - and I guess you get what you pay for . I thought the sound was ok , but I almost always listen to podcasts or audio books , so I 'm not that fussy . However , it had a couple other problems . The retracting mechanism stopped working in a very short time , and since this was one of the reasons I selected these , that was very disappointing . Also , the winding piece is too heavy , and doesn't have any kind of clip to hold it in place . It kept pulling the earbuds out of my ears . I ended up having to clip the lanyard from my mp3 player to it to hold it . I 'd recommend trying something else .  
  I bought EVA8000 July 24th , 2007Make Long story short1 If you want to see video clip for 2006 or later version , do not buy this since most of video clip is unavailable to play2 When you purchase Netgear Product , never expect to get any technicalsupport form them . They would not answer whatever it is . I ask 5 questions since I bought but no answeruntil today Aug 13,2007 . I had always respond saying ' my name OO will responsible your question .. ' from different person . It reminds me that old man said ' Everybody 's resposible is nobody 's responsible '  
  I have had 2 of these for 3 years . they BREAK pencil leads . My students have to go back and try again at least 50 % of the time .  
  I purchased this product to even out the loud scenes and the quiet conversations on many DVDs . I connected it between the DVD player and the TV sound jacks per the instructions , but unfortunately it doesn't work . At all . If the volume is set to hear the quiet scenes , the loud scenes are much too loud and vice versa . The Terk VR1 Automatic TV Volume Controller is a waste of money .  
  This product sucks big time . Firstly , My laptop fails to recognise this product each time I plug it into my USB port . ( My USB port works fine with all other peripherals ) . If in case it recognises after 10 frustrating trails , it connects and disconnects in no time . I would certainly not recommend this product .  
  Don't buy this ! Just received mine in the mail today and immediately saw it was a DVI-I not a DVI-D like the picture shows . Freaking ridiculous they can't even be bothered to match up the picture and what they ship when you order this , completely worthless to me now ! Don't buy this hoping they get it right they won't .  
  I bought a B + W KSM Polarized Circular filter and threaded to the B + W UV filter and couldn't get them apart . In addition , the UV filter wouldn't properly thread to my new Canon 18-135mm EFS lens .  
  I bought the Lynksys Router and was unable to set up my wireless network . This couldn't have been more confusing .  
  Apparently Savage has the worst quality control ever . Product arrived with several tears that went over 6ft into roll . With the packaging still perfectly intact , so someone at savage doesn't mind selling damaged goods as new . So poor quality control and horrible customer service leave me stuck with 4/5ths of what I paid for . Ive done a lot of research online and it arriving horribly torn is very very common !  
  Zaurus users , there is an " old " and a " new " version of this card . This is the new version , which is less expensive , but DOES NOT work out of the box with the current Zaurus Spectrum drivers available on myzaurus . com ( or on socketcom . com ) . The old version is the WL6000 ( B00005RZP3 ) which does have Zaurus driver support as of 3/6/2004 . Don't buy this cheaper , newer card unless you 're convinced the drivers are available at the time you read this .  
  Didn't work out of the box . I had to return it . Amazon accepted the return and I went and bought a Belkin router that works great , missing a couple features I wanted but it works .  
  Swept up in the rapture of her own dense , boozy , swampy verbiage , Miss Donna done gone and misplaced her plot ! If someone can find it for her , the great American novel might have a fightin ' chance . As is , it 's goin ' down with the rest of the old , Deep South . Guess she was just aworried ' bout bein ' taken seriously as a poetic type writer . But I fears she done gone hog wild with them words . Miss T stuck in some action parts , but they sure ain't long enough or real enough to save the rest from asinkin ' . Mammy needs to kick some sense back into Missy T 's head I think . Git her back on track .  
  This is my first review of a consumer product and unfortunately it has to be bad . If all worked well , a satisfied customer tends to be a quiet one . Note before you read further that I owned a 604WiFi , which is the prior generation of this model in 30GB format . The issues with the units themselves are particular to the unit , but warranty is the same and that is what this review is about , since this is an investment . I owned a 604WiFi 30 GB unit since February 2007 with DVR station .. bought on Amazon for $ 300 plus $ 100 for the DVR station . Out of the box the thing worked great . Moving music and photos to the unit was simple , the graphics were amazing , and the DVR worked well enough , though it is far from intuitive . From a day to day perspective the unit worked as intended and you feel you have a more superior product than anything similar Apple or Sony can make . Except for the slow browser , heavy weight of the unit itself , the extreme heat the hard drive generates , and the incredibly short battery life , I give it 4 stars for effort and see potential . However , customer service and support are less than 1 star if possible . In May I plugged the unit into my PC to swap music out and the hard drive crashed ( all files on unit erased except for the system file ) . The unit wouldn't even turn on . I called customer service in Colorado to get the response of " yup , it 's your hard drive , that will cost you about $ 150 , here 's your RMA number . " Well now , that is half the price of the unit for approximately 450 days of use . Thus , if I decide not to repair it , the unit will cost about a $ 1.00 a day to operate . If I do repair it , the unit will have cost me $ 550 , including the DVR station , with no guarantee it won't crash in another year . I don't know about you , but a 30GB MP3 player for $ 550 is a little high . No thanks Archos , your product is garbage and so is your warranty program . If you can't back your product , why should I , and thus this review . If you buy the product know that you are receiving a state of the art unit with everything you need in an all in one package , but should it " break , " it is a very expensive investment . Perhaps consider buying used to hedge your bet . Hope this is helpful .  
  Just beware . The battery looks good , fits my Canon 1100 camera just fine . However , it would not charge in the Canon battery charger . The orange charge light on the charger would go on then go off right away . I wrote the company and they quickly responded . They said the battery should be completely compatible with Canon charger , and if it didn't work battery must be defective . I was impressed by company 's response , but returned it and bought a different brand . How often are these defective ? Your guess is as good as mine . At least Amazon will take it back if it is defective .  
  Never buy a product from Westinghouse Digital . I purchased a laptop from them and it arrived with major hardware problems . Upon discovering the problem with my computer , I attempted to obtain an RMA number and my call was NEVER returned . Without this number you cannot get anything serviced . After I called 3 times over the period of two weeks , someone finally told me the number and the address . They received my package on January 9 , and I have not heard a single thing since then ( February 13 ) . Furthermore , everytime I have called to inquire , I have been on hold for an unacceptably long period , and when my call was finally answered , the response was that they knew nothing and would get back to me , which never happened . I have been without my computer for a month and a half now , with no end in sight . It is a gamble to purchase any product from this company , since any factory defect may lead you to lose complete track of your property and spend countless hours on hold and listening to excuses .  
  I have had two Cannon digital cameras . Both have suddenly stopped working after a few months with an E18 error . This error seems to be common among Cannon cameras . It appears the lens motor stops working . Nothing you can do about it .  
  I just read three negative reviews from customers that are all having the same problem I had . The product works great for 3 months and then does not work at all . When I put in a DVD the screen says " Loading " and then " No DIsc " . Apparently this product only works for a few months , so I am assuming the great reviews are from very recent customers . I called Magnavox Customer Service and they were no help at all - they told ne to get a DVD laser lens cleaner , which I did - but the cleaner is a disc , so when I put in on of course I got the same message - " No Disc " . I gave 1 star because there is no option for no stars .  
  This product is supposed to lower the volume of your TV when those very annoying overly LOUD commercials come on . Great idea . Poor product . I have tried it on 3 different TVs with no success . I would not advise anyone to purchase this product .  
  The product description states that the required car kit comes with the GPS . IT DOES NOT ! The GPS is not usable without the car kit ( another $ 50.00 ! ) . The real joy comes when you try and contact Amazon . It was impossible to canel the order . There are also NO Phone numbers listed to talk to a human . This is the last time I purcahse from Amazon .  
  The insulating jacket did not allow the cable to seat properly . I had to keep pressure for the pins to make contact .  
  I bought this SanDisk 8GB back in March 2009 and it has gone bad with almost 200 pictures on it . Nothing like telling a family that I have lost every photo taken because of a bad SanDisk . I will never buy SanDisk again because I need to know that what I 'm photographing is going to be there in the end . Very upset and just might have cost me a customer because my Canon 5d never gave a warning that the card was bad until I went to upload my pics . UPDATE : After long phone calls I finally sent the card back to SanDisk . So it has been a month and still no new card has been replaced . Another LONG phone call placed today and couldnt get a answer out of two people other than " we will e-mail you within 24-48 hours " . I 'm calling BS on SanDisk because if you say your going to back your product then you should replace ASAP . I 'm shooting a wedding in two weeks and would like to have a new card . I did branch out and bought the Lexar Pro UDMA and there have not been any problems ( knock on wood ) .  
  Wow , what a piece of expensive garbage . The setup is easy and it found my videos ( although not MP4s as promised ) , but it simply will not play them . You 'll go along great for a few minutes , and then it freezes . Or reboots . Or stops . Or returns you to the beginning of the clip . No way to get out of it , and firmware updates do not help or resolve any of the issues . Don't waste your money !  
  This thing is impossible to use . If you do manage to find something with it , you can look at it for about one minute until it drifts out of view . Then spend another ten minutes searching for it . The altitude lock doesn't even hold the scope in place because it 's so badly out of balance . I got mine as a gift , and the only reason I haven't donated it to Goodwill is because I 'd feel guilty about someone else paying $ 20 for it .  
  For the very short period of time it worked , it was great . It began freezing up with software problems , and support is the helplessdesk . These poor people have been contracted by iRiver and abandoned . I really believed , even after many weeks of research , that I was getting a quality product . It is junk . Don't waste your money or your time .  
  The Tivo plarform / configuration is a great concept however , many technical issues have arisen which have rendered my machine useless .. the basic problem rests with the compatability of the Tivo unit with my cable box ( AT & T Broadband Service w / a Motorola Digital cable box ) .. the two do not communicate properly thus the Tivo unit cannot change channels to accomodate my selections for recording . I have spent literally 5 + hours on the phone with Tivo / AT & T. . although attentive , both sides are admitting the issues are widespread .. at the end of the day I have a Tivo unit which will only work like a dummy VCR .. I have to have the channel manually set on the station I want to record and hope for the best .. hopefully this will get resolved .. and relucantly so I am looking into the much anticipated product from Microsoft .. hopefully Bill was a bit more " in tune " ( no pun intended ) with making things " synch " ( oh , boy .. maybe he 's buying AT & T ) .  
  Signal goes in and out . I recommend spending a little more to get a higher quality product . This cord was a complete waste of time .  
  Died on me , not for sure if it was from a virus and whiped out sectors , Norton did find some junk the day before it died , but said it got rid of it all ..  
  They say beauty is only skin deep . Can that adage apply to literature as well as people ? The Little Friend would seem to prove that it can . Donna Tartt has outdone herself producing chapter upon chapter of exquisite , tasteful , occasionally insightful prose . But to what end ? After so much bounty , one feels empty and at a loss as to why . Perhaps that was Tartt 's literary intent ( though I would tend to doubt it ) . Perhaps she simply got lost in the rapture of creation . Either way , The Little Friend is a stunning disappointment . It 's all style with a paucity of substance . Perhaps she thought no one would notice . That remains the true mystery of The Little Friend . And Tartt 's motivation is the enigma .  
  I purchased this for myself as a replacement for my old DVD player . It will not work , has no registration info . and no instructions , etc . for set up . It is going back for a different brand .  
  I bought this mouse because every laptop mouse I have had seems to last only about 6 months and this one has great reviews . So far , after two weeks , the mouse is working fine but I cannot use it in a conference or meeting because the scroll wheel is so noisy that it would draw attention . I have never heard such a noisy wheel . I was also very disappointed that the people at Logitech have absolutely no concern for the environment . The excessive amount of heavy duty plastic packaging seems more appropriate for the crown jewels than a cheap mouse . I needed a heavy duty knife to cut through the sealed plastic and then the sharp plastic edge cut my finger . In short , I would not buy this mouse again .  
  What Target store has thisPhilips CD / Radio Boombox # AZ2035 by Philips ? I was calling to several consumer departments and nobody heardabout this boombox . Al  
  I ordered what I saw in the photo Canon ink cartridges from Gener Ink , but I was sent a " no name " brand . Literally , there was no name on it . I think this is false advertising . It took several emails and me having to send back the no name cartridges without getting reimbursed for the postage , but my acct Amazon says has been credited . I can't say I learned a lesson , because I thought I was getting what was pictured . Just order from Canon if you want Canon - it is a good brand .  
  While this keyboard has sleek-looking hotness , it really isn't that good of a keyboard for home or office use . I find the Gyration keyboards to be much more functional , and the keyboard isn't as comfortable to use as my Thinkpad X-series keypad ( and it 's smaller ) . Cons : ExpensiveLack of functionalityControls don't work as expectedAlmost impossible to use when charging the batteryNot as comfortable as many other laptop keyboardsDid I mention it was expensive ? Pros : Looks really nice on the desktopKeyboard will work before windows boots .  
  Purchased two of these on clearance for our library ; not worth the trouble . One arrived broken and needed a spring replaced ( luckily , I was able to do this myself ) . One print head was defective out of the package and is streaking less than 250 pages later . Both printers skew every page by 1/16 " or more from top to bottom , which makes our letterhead look horrible . Other than that , the print quality is OK , they 're pretty quick , and take up a lot of desk space . As for myself , I 'll stick with Canon .  
  These do stay put when you move and they are not that hard to figure out once you look at the picture on the website . However , the cord is horrible - it is way too long and it kinks . These also look very big and awkward . I returned mine and bought BudFits . I love them . I could not keep earbuds in for more than a minute or two when I was running , but the Budfits attach to the original ipod earbuds , are adjustable , keep them in place perfectly , and are less than $ 10 . I think they would fit on most other earbuds besides just the original ipod earbuds . Innovelis BudFits - Vanilla WhiteInnovelis BudFits - Stealth Black  
  This is the only remote I have ever used that when you press Volume or Channel it does not continuously change .. the volume changes only one step and you must press again . You must press for each channel ! This is not the way remotes should work . Further , the codes for the Pioneer Amplifier did not work correctly . They can be re-programmed . I sent this back . If a remote cannot transmit multiple times when a button is held down , it is worthless to me .  
  I bought two Kingston DataTraveler II 1GB flash drives from Amazon last week based on favorable reviews here . They have a serious design flaw that would have led me to select another brand if I could have tried the drives before buying them . Kingston designed the USB plug with a detachable plastic cap . The cap has a very smooth curved surfaces that are difficult to grasp . Documentation in the package included a four paragraph " installation guide " but no diagrams or instructions about handling the drive itself . I couldn't pull the cap off the first drive with any reasonable amount of force . I finally used a small screwdriver to pry it off ( gouging its soft plastic edge in the process ) . Inspection of the parts revealed an important discovery . The inner edge of the cap has a small ridge which mates with a groove in body of the drive , holding the cap in place . To remove the cap , grasp it by its narrow sides , not by the top and bottom . Squeezing the top and bottom of the cap just seats the ridge more firmly in its groove preventing removal of the cap . Even knowing this trick was not enough to get the cap off easily every time I tried . To get a proper graspable surface I cut two small ( 5 x 12 mm ) strips of anti-skid tape ( sold for bathtubs and stairs ) and glued them along the edges of the cap . This was an effective kludge for the flaw in Kingston 's design , but the time and effort needed to fix the problem was more than the drive was worth to me .  
  " The one star is required and no negative stars are available so it got a 1 " I used my DVDR80/17 for 8 faithful months not paying any attention to the reviews . If you do buy one I hope for your health 's sake your DVDR80 is better than mine . After fourth trip to the " authorized repair facility " it was returned with only four recording modes , not having the 2x ( or 2.5 hour mode ) and the M6 and M8 ( not that I used them but they wern't there ) . I haven't tried to do anything but play a DVD as yet because I was sick at my stomach after the setup and seeing only the M1,2,3,4 modes were available and really did not want to go any further at the time . The first time it tried to play a disk it went into the record and I had to pull the plug to turn it off . After the second setup it did play a disk . BUT , to contact Philips and get anything but the check this check this , then the well I see from the history this has been done . IF you can understand the person in the first place . If you live upstairs go out on the balcony give a good yell . You will get a better faster reply . As I was told they are out of the repair picture after they turn it over to joe shmuck 's repair shop . And the repair shop will talk very nice about how they will fix it up just fine , but mine is still broke after FOUR trips . Every time it was returned from the shop it was worse than before . I personally wish I had never seen the Philips name , I would be $ 600 and many hours aggrivation better off . So Beware ! READ those reviews , folks like Amazon , cnet , dvdhelp , and a host of others put them there to help you , to keep you from making the same mistake many others have . Wish I had listened !  
  Although these people advertise their product as a " Canon " cable , show an actual " Canon " cable photo , complete with the " Canon " part number ; what they send to you is some generic junk cable . I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this cable . I complained to Amazon about this vendor running a deceptive ad , but to date nothing has been done and their " Canon " ad is still running . So if you are looking for an actual " Canon " cable you had better shop with a different vendor , because you will not be getting one here . Andrew  
  This company was busted for copyright infringement . It is now out of business . You can not get these things repaired ! Mine worked fine for about a year . Then it refused to recognize disks . Still plays DVD 's but impossible to record . Will not format disks . No way to have it repaired . Was a total waste of money !  
  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband . I thought it was probably too good to be true to get a 5 GB MP3 player for under $ 100 . And it was ! After less than one day of use he got the same message others got : " File system corrupted . " I called RCA and was told the unit would have to be replaced . Now two weeks ( and $ 10 for UPS shipping ) later and he still doesn't have an MP3 player and we 're out over $ 100 . I 'm hoping they have made some changes and the new one we get from RCA will have software upgrades to prevent this problem . If it happens again we 'll have to return it to Amazon and cut our losses .  
  Please Note : I purchased a somewhat different model - 6100 Pro - over 1 year ago . I was unhappy with the purchase from the onset and have subsequently purchased a Canon 8400F .. a great scanner . The Microtek took very good scans from photos and film ( 35 mm slides ) . However , it rarely worked . It failed to recognize my computer and when I finally achieved a good scan it just stopped . Eventually , I convinced Microtek to replace the scanner however , the same problem recurred . I tossed the Microtek and bought a Canon . I could not recommend Microtek for a mid level flatbed scanner . In addition their customer technical service department is courteous , but they are almost impossible to contact . If you want a flatbed scanner in the $ 250 to $ 550 range you should look elsewhere .  
  I bought this product because it looked easy to mount and easily accesible from the front seat . When it arrived I could see that the mounting bars were on a slant , rather than straight across like in the photos . When I mounted it to the car it slanted toward one seat more than the other . I called customer service for the product 3 times . The first time I called the representative was very lovely and told me I could return it directly to the company since we needed the product for a vacation and they would send me a new one . I thought this was very good customer service at the time . I paid the shipping and they sent me one with the exact same problem . When I called customer service again I was told that the mounting bars are repositionable , which they are not . I asked for a refund of the cost of shipping and the representative told me she was not in a position to do that . I asked her who was and she said her manager was and she would have to call me back . The manager called me back and told me they could not refund my money because they hadn't received the returned unit yet and even when they did she could not gaurantee that a refund would be granted . I explained to her that I wish I was told from the beginning that nothing could be done to correct the problem and to just send the item back to Amazon for a refund . She responded by saying " Have a nice day . " I will never deal with Digital Innovations again .  
  The Linksys Wireless-G range expander WRE54G is the worst product I 've ever tried to use with my computer . After hiring a computer consultant , I was finally able to get it configured to work . The setup tools did not work and the so-called technical support is worse than nothing . Now after 6 months of use , my device suddenly stopped working alltogether . After 2 hours on hold , the so-called technical support suggested that I buy a new one - the device can't be repaired .  
  Bought this to replace a Sony Touchscreen Remote . Installed the software and setup and account . I spent an hour setting up and customizing three devices and their associated activities . Downloaded everything and it worked fine mostly . However , my TV took too long to too long to start and missed the input command . Went back to the software and adjusted the TV startup time . Clicked download and got " Unable to display content " . It wouldn't work . Called up Logitech support and they reported the database was corrupt and the only way to fix it was to delete the TV and associated activities . That didn't fix it though .. and they ended up deleting every device and reinitializing my account to get the remote to download again . Over half an hour on the phone ( half of it on hold ) and an hours worth of customizing , went poof . So I started over , spent another hour . Tested everything and still needed a few more seconds delay . Went back to software , added it , and poof , " Unable to display content " . Called up again , another half an hour wasted and they had to delete my entire account again ! So three hours down the drain and I have nothing to show for it . Absolutely the last Harmony remote I ever try !  
  I purchased this book as soon as it was published , and couldn't wait to read it . I have finally read it , and I can't believe how disappointed I am . I absolutely loved " The Secret History " , it is one of my all time favorite books that I have ever read . This book , as is her style , was fabulous when it comes character developement , scene descriptions , dark and gloomy mystery . But why couldn't she wrap up the loose ends and give the reader some sort of answer to the question of what happened to Robin ? That was the only thing that kept me reading to the end .  
  Well , here 's the thing . I liked this mouse when I first got it . After all , its optical , it feels nice on my hand , and controls well . But later on down the road .. The track ball has gotten stuck . Don't know how , don't know why , but when scrolling , it gets to a point and STICKS . This is extremely frustrating when playing online video games where speed is essential . This , in itself , wouldn't be much of a problem if there was a way to open it and clean it . But .. there 's none . No screws , nothing that pops off .. its just one solid unit . So , if you 're looking for a temporary mouse , then this might be for you . But if you want one that will last more than 3 months .. look elsewhere .  
  I wish I had read Marc Anderson 's review first . I was rather skeptical about this product being so helpful and useful to really calibrate an HDTV , but unfortunately , decided to waste approx . $ 20 and buy one ( not thtough Amazon ) . It might be of some use to someone who has never seen a TV set before , but the average person can adjust the color , brightness and contrast , etc . to get a picture suitable to watch by going through each setting , if you don't like the manufacturer 's pre-settings . I had learned that such a product was available and tried several of the rental stores first , but they weren't available yet , if they even will be . Save your money on this one and see if there is such a thing that is really useful . Gary Patterson Decatur , IL  
  I purchased this GPS thinking that it was a portable battery powered GPS . I came to find out it needs to be plugged into a power source at all times . I just thought that for how much it costs it wouldn't have to be plugged in all the time . This is a lame product .  
  The idea behind this is great but it does not support all printers . I have a canon lazer printer ( new ) and it did not support it . Call Linksys before you buy to see if it supports your printer .  
  I purchased this unit less than two months ago and it has never worked right . It turns off after one disk plays and the menu display will not come up . Forget the GE 800 number - they route you to a long distance number and keep you on the phone forever . They would not take it back , but told me to buy a disk cleaner . My local repair shop said that would do nothing . Why should I buy more stuff to try to fix their problem ? By the time I make the long distance calls , buy the " fixes " and pay to ship it back , I will have spent good money on a piece of junk . I 've decided to dump the unit and buy a new one of better quality . GE .. thanks a whole bunch ..  
  It simply did not work . I tested it against a shorter cable ( the one I was trying to replace with this one ) , and the shorter cable worked . This one did not . Buy a cable with a company name on it , like Belkin etc . They 're more likely to be QA 'd properly , at least since the company 's brand would suffer if they failed to work . I would exchange this cable , but the equipment setup it was originally supposed to be used with was delayed in its implementation by several months . My seller has a 30-day return / exchange policy . Lesson : Verify functional integrity of all purchases upon receipt , even if they won't be used immediately . One final note : This product has much thinner contact strips on the interior of its B-plug ( the one that goes into the printer ) than the same strips on the interior of my working cable 's B-plug . Bad manufacturing ? You decide .  
  While this keyboard looks fancy next to my flat screen and is fairly compact for HTPC use , it is so poorly made . First of all , I 'm already on my second one since the first one made a whining noise that was obnoxious by the end of week 3 . I 've had the replacement for 3 months and now the whining noise is obnoxious on this one too . It only whines when it 's being charged , but it can be heard across the room enough that at age 35 ( less sensitive ears ) , I still can't stand to be in the same room while it 's charging . In addition , this keyboard ( as well as the prior ) loses the keyboard functionality even though the mousepad still works at least once every couple hours of consistent use . I end up having to walk across the room to re-sync the device in order for it to work again . Also , I 've used better designed mouse pads on laptops back in the 90 's . The mouse pad is fairly finicky and a bit too small to be practical . For $ 150 , this thing is crud . From the sounds of prior reviews , the whining issue has been around for quite a while and still in 2010 , Logitech has not fixed it . After buying multiple Logitech products , I 've come to the conclusion that they often have interesting designs with concepts that are often ahead of their competitors , but poor follow-through on developing a quality product behind the design and innovation . I 'm done with them .  
  This cable worked fine for a few months , but lately it has been suffering from constant dropouts . I can't get through pretty much any session on the computer without the video going out over and over again .  
  I purchased this unit about a year ago for my IPAQ 5455 PDA , which is a pretty decked out and powerful unit . I had installed no other programs , so there was nothing else that should have conflicted . The GPS continuously froze and I called tech support . They informed me of a known issue with the software and told me to download a patch . I did so and it helped none . On a 12 hour drive from CT to NC , it froze at least 10 times . I wanted this unit because it was supposed to increase my security by keeping me from taking the wrong turn into the bronx off of 287 in NY that I have often mistakenly taken . Instead , I risked my personal saftey by hard rebooting my PDA at Interstate cruising speed and trying to get this thing working . After it crashed twice , I switched driving positions so I could play with it from the passenger seat while my significant other drove , but to no avail . This unit is supposed to offer great improvements over the 3420 ( which was notorious for such problems ) , but I did not find this to be the case . In order to maintain full navigation functionality , 3 satelites must be within signal range for accurate triangulation of the position , and as many as 12 may be accessed at one time . It took a long time to acquire signal , then it was lost quickly . I have used other ( more antiquated ) GPS systems that were able to obtain reliable sat signals much more quickly , so I was very disappointed . The software functionality is decent , but that doesn't matter because it crashes so much that it is available only for a limited time . I have since returned the GPS and sold my PDA because the main intended purpose had been for use as a GPS unit . Go with a dedicated GPS such as the Magellan Meridian Color if you want to get into GPS .  
  Who wants to create onto MPEG ? not me .. who wants to fork out money for a camera that does not produce quality pictures and has a poor zoom .. not me .. I guess for you video buffs , this might tide you over , but in the world of digital cameras , like computers , another camera will be coming out soon with better bells and whistles . Well , you can't avoid that right ? But this camera is not even up to par in the first place , i 'm sorry . I 'll stick to a Kodak FUn saver before shelling out my hard earned money on this soon to be outdated Sony product . And I 'm sorry , but Sony is not " top of the line " my friends , by any means . It 's the K-Swiss of Electronics , the Jack In the Box , the K Mart , the .. i could go on . Ok I will .. its the New Orleans Saints of Electronics , the Butler , the John Ritter , the Dow Corning .. anyways .. NEEXT !  
  piece of junk , wasted 20 some dollars ! OMG , please , do yourself a favor , don't buy even if it 's free , don't get it , period !  
  Bought the Harmony 880 on the recommendation of an acquaintance . Maybe it works well for him , but I 've tried everything possible to get this remote to work correctly with my system , but it refuses to do so . Tried contacting Logitech support via email and NEVER received a response , troubleshooting in the remote and bundled software didn't help at all . Tried training it with the 4 remotes it takes to run everything in my system and had only limited success . I can turn the Tivo on and access the menus , but could not get pause , stop , and FF functions to work on the 880 ! If you have a Samsung TV , keep looking , the Harmony 880 is not capable of correctly changing inputs for various functions . No matter what I did , I had to fall back to changing inputs with the TV remote , and the whole purpose of the exercise was to be able to use just a single remote to control all the components in the system . Not going to happen with this one ..  
  It nearly destroy my DVD burner . I spend nearly one hour to burn a memorex DVD-R in my 16X sony burner .  
  I wanted this for the mirror as well as the radio . The mirror is useless and doesn't clean up at all .  
  the review said it woould work with my ipod shuffle . but it DID NOT . got in my truck to use it and was VERY BUMMED OUT !  
  As stated , I got about 20 pages out of the first cartridge , and about 5 out of the second . The colors seems to be holding up decent , but I mostly print documents and not much color . Guess I 'll go back to the canon brand . Bummer .  
  I liked this for a while , but suddenly the software stopped working and I cannot seem to fix it . I had a different MD player also from Sony and it broke , but I always had pretty good luck with Sony stuff so I bought this one . As of yet I have heard nothing from Sony on what the fix might be .  
  Caveat emptor . If you need a keyboard with a PS2 connection , this is not for you . Amazon was very good , though . They not only shipped a replacement , but took both the original and the replacement back on Amazon 's dime , and refunded the full purchase price . That is why I shop on this site . Now , if someone would only sell a programmable keyboard with a PS2 connection , both " Tom " and I will be happy :> )  
  After having problems receiving faxes from certain fax machines , I just returned my HP to buy a Cannon Multipass .  
  Echoing some other experiences : poor documentation , either it sets up right and goes or not ; if not , you are D E A D . My was going then quit . As a computer type , I am used to poor documentation and working at setting things up but when the unit does not function as advertised , then it 's time to rate it accordingly : specifically , the reset button does .. nothing . This renders the unit worthless as it cannot be setup since , once it falls off the network , it cannot be " found " and brought back on-line . The reset sw should allow this but , alas , it does not work as stated by others . Would not buy again and don't recommend unless you like Vegas type odds .  
  I am not very familiar with turntable but my boyfriend is . I bought this for him and it doesn't work as well as anymore only after 3 weeks of purchase . I may be doing something wrong but I 've tried everything but it keeps playing song fast althought I had adjusted the speed level .  
  Ran first disk . After that kept giving " no disc " message .  
  I like the style and functionality of the case . It is quiet and looks nice , but the CPU air duct thingy seems a little more gimmicky than practical . The weakness is the Antec SmartPower 450 Watt power supply ( PSU ) . In theory it is a good power supply , but in reality has shown lack of durability . There have been quite a few people complaining of complete PSU failure within a year . Yesterday my own failed on me and I had to go buy a new one . These things aren't that cheap ! On the plus side , the PSU has a 3 year warranty . Trouble is I can't allow my machine to be down for several weeks while Antec sends me a new one .  
  I purchase this backpack several months ago and I am very dis-appointed in the design and quality . The shoulder straps are poorly designed which make it difficult to ware the backpack for any length of time . The zippers just open on their own or just won't close . The pockets make it hard to organize items in the backpack .  
  I 'm using it with my Canon SD600 digital camera .. I have another 1gb as back-up  
  I 've returned from a River Barge Excursion ( 8 days on the Ohio & Mississippi Rivers ) , and I used my Canon IS binoculars ALL the time . I purchased additional 123 Photo batteries , anticipating I would ' use up ' the original battery from constant use , but so far haven't made a battery change . I did manage to lose one of the eyepiece caps , and I plan to contact Canon to see if I can purchase a set of replacement caps . I also have / use a Canon Powershot S5 IS digital camera , and the lens cap is tethered to the neckstrap , which is a very convenient place to ' put ' the lens cap while using the camera . I would like to see Canon design a similar ' tethering ' for their binocular eyepiece caps .  
  The drive quit working after about 6 months , and I only used it about 3 or 4 times , if that . Also , when it did work , It copied very slowly . Now when I connect it to a PC I get " Drive will not start " , and it doesn't show up in my computer . It was a great idea , and the 5 gigs is nice , but if it doesn't work then what good is it ? I am sticking with flash memory drives after this experience .  
  I have had this for 7 months now and have yet to change the battery , and it 's performed perfect . I am online most the day every day working or browing the web and the smooth scoll is a nice feature to have . Once had a logitech but it broke down on me after a about 2 months . It is also very comfy to hold . Worth the money !  
  Coby CA-745 Wireless FM Car Transmitter with Digital Display and DC Car Cigarette Lighter AdapterThis thing is awsome . CD quality . Unbelievable bargain . Buy it . You won't be sorry . It is worth so much more than what I paid .  
  I have enjoyed it tremondously . I don't know what I have done without it . Great product . I would recommend this any one .  
  I love this camera . It 's by far the best value in a digital camera . I spent ages comparing features and prices . It has better resolution and zoom - 2.1 MP , 3 X optical and 4 X digital than cameras manufactured by the well-known camera companies , and for about half the price . The auto-focus , red eye eliminator etc . work very well . Out of the 400 shots I took the first three days I had the camera , only 3 were underexposed . The camera can take good , clear pictures of very small objects ( 12 X zoom , distant objects , interior , exterior . The silent movie option also works well . My only beef is that the batteries supplied with the camera only allowed me to shoot and upload about 400 pictures . So I recommend buying rechargables . This has replaced my older Cannon Eos Rebel .  
  The keyboard came with dirt inside the keys , one of the back risers was broke , and two keys had the letters worn off .  
  I received the unit as a gift 1 year ago and I was thrilled with the quality and look of the unit - I think panasonic did a good job on the looks of the unit . A month ago , my unit stopped working giving me error code H02 . I called panasonic and waited 1 hour for customer service . After discussing the issue with the representative I was told that the issue was due to a spindle problem . At first Panasonic did not want to pay for the defect , but agreed later to send me a letter stating that I could take it to an agreed service location and that they would pay for the parts only . A month went by and I still had not received the letter . I called and waited for 1 hour and 20 minutes on the phone . I spoke with the representative and was told that my case was still pending and that they did not have anything else to tell me . I have contacted them a couple of times and even asked to speak with a supervisor and they refuse to transfer me - their service is terrible . I was so disatisfied with their service and product that I gave up and I purchased another dvd player yesterday . I purchased the 7 " Polaroid DVD for about ( .. ) at Circuit city as a replacement . For what I need it , this inexpensive unit is good enough . As a last word , I would warn you that if you are planning to purchase this unit , keep in mind that it may fail and Panasonic most probably will not do much to help you out . Also , this unit according to some reviews in the internet , has various issues ( i.e. code errors H03 , H02 ) which render the unit unoperable . Hopefully this helps you make a better decision .  
  Let me stress a serious point : H4cK1nG is not a thing , just as art , math , and science are not things . For newbies who have asked " how do i hack , " read this book ! You 'll understand the CONCEPTS and IDEAS behind hacking and network security in general . Asking how do i hack is like asking how do i do art . There is no set definition of hacking ( if there were , there 'd only be one book and text on it w / explicit directions , and Sys Adm . jobs would be a lot easier ! ) So get this book , less ye be flamed from asking stupid 1 @ m3r questions ! -j +  
  Got this three months ago use it everyday , no problems at all . even has a screw peaces so its secure all the time  
  ordered this as someone said I needed it to make my VCR work with my TV , but it wasn't the right thing . I had to open it , for it to be connected & now I 'm stuck with it as you can't returned opened items .  
  This was so well worth the money spent on it . Improves on the camera light extremely well and no hassel with it 's own power source . Plug it in to the hot shoe and forget about it . No dying while recording and lights a very usable area . Great product .  
  We have bought a number of replacement cartridges for our Brother 8850DN through Amazon . This one though prints very light right out of the box . Unfortunately , Since I ordered it to have on hand when our other cartridge failed , it was more than 30 days since I ordered it . Only 50 % refund and I would have to be without a cartridge . I 'll buy locally from now on because it is a business critical item .  
  Great cable no issues at all , it is stamped 5E as it should and has the metal cover on the plugs . I have to assume that there is sheielding in the cable .  
  Bought this printer on Black Friday for $ 20 from Best Buy . I am very pleased with the quality of printing , ease of use and the all-in-one feature . If you are copying documents , there are distinct buttons for Black / White and Color printing options . Scanner works without a problem as well . Overall , BEST BUY for the price .  
  I love this camera ! The smallest case I could find for it was too big ! Here are the highlights and lowlights : Hits : Size-it 's smaller than it looks ; you just want to hold it ! Quality-Nikon . That should tell you it 's quality . Macros-Nikon is legendary for awesome close-ups ! Format-uses AA 's and CF media . SO cheap and easy ! BSS-best shot selector . Handy ! Lots of features ! Misses : Some shutter lag , but there always is in this price range . Not the fastest focus-same as above , though . Harder to find now . 3200 model not nearly as format-friendly ! 3 megapixels can only be enlarged so far . Enough for most . For the price , this one is impossible to beat . ' Adorable ' is the most heard description . The fact that it takes good photos is a bonus !  
  This printer is great ! I got this printer about two months ago , paid $ 150 from amazon , and I 've had very few complaints . It truly is a great printer , and exceeded my expectations . I was hesitant at first to get this printer because I wasn't actually able to find it in stores ( not available at the major electronic stores ) , and didn't have a chance to test it out ahead of time . Trust me on this though , it really is great ! PROS : Simple to set upExcellent print qualityGreat software ( easy to use ) Memory slotsGreat color LCD displayPrint on both sides of the paper without having to do any work ! 2 paper feeders ( comes in handy .. automatically switches when one is out ) Very quickCheap Cartridges ( around $ 12 per color ) 5-cartridge printer ( when one color runs out , you don't have to replace the whole cartridge , just the one that is out ) Extremely easy to install cartridges ( lights inside the printer tell you whether it is installed properly or not ) Easy to scan and copyQuiet ( once it has " warmed up " EXCELLENT VALUE ( beats most of the $ 300-400 printers ) CONS : a bit BIG and clunkyno faxtakes a while to " warm up " ( once it warms up .. its FAST ) This is by far the best printer I have ever used . The only concern I would have is that if you don't have much space , you might be in trouble , but that would be the case with almost any other all in one ( this is a little bigger than normal though ) . I already had a fax , so the fact it didn't have that feature wasn't a big letdown , but if you have to have a fax , I would still go with Canon ( cheapest cartridges and great quality ) . When you turn the printer on , or if you haven't used it in a while , it will make wierd noises ( I guess its " warming up " ? ) for 20-30 seconds , but then its good to go for a while . I would definitely suggest this printer to anyone looking for a great multifunction printer , especially if on a budget .  
  I purchased this ink cartridge in August , knowing I 'd have a back-up when needed . I did finally need it , installed it this past weekend ( beginning of December 2012 ) , since then it has only printed with lots of lines , like the ink is dry . The quality is atrocious . I opened a claim to return it through Amazon citing these concerns , and the response was that I 'm out of my time frame for a return ( which is true ) . Very disappointed .  
  Works well . Could provide more substantial protection , but primary purpose is to protect the screen , which it does . Did not have any difficulty operating the device , like other reviewers have mentioned - think you just have to be " authoritative " with your button-pushing .  
  These speakers are amazing for the price . Other than the lower bass response , which is still better than you 'd expect from speakers this small , and lower maximum volume , I 'd say the sound quality is roughly equivalent to my iHome clock radio dock . The maximum volume with amplification is still respectable and it works just as well with rechargeable batteries ( which are typically lower voltage than alkalines ) as it does with the USB power adapter . For $ 5.20 for price and shipping , these are more than worth it .  
  I got this lens to replace my older Quantaray 70-300mm . I got tired to losing a lot of images to camera shake at the 300mm end . Plus the lens I had was old ( almost 10 years ) and optically it wasn't that great . The Nikkor 70-300mm w / VRII is perfect for me . I love the way the VR works . I 've been able to get useable images taken at the 300mm end with a 1/6th shutter . Very impressive . No more camera shake issues at the long end . I 'm also very impressed with how sharp it is ( it is sharper than my 18-70mm ) and also the focus is fast and quiet . It is on the big side , but not to much larger than any other 70-300mm lens . I 'm very happy with the performance of this lens . I find the addition of the VR to be very much worth it . Granted its not a fast lens and I never intended it to take the place of or performe like an f / 2.8 lens . Its not fair to compare it to any f / 2.8 lens . Comparing to the previous 2 Nikkor 70-300mm models or any of the 3rd party 70-300mm 's , this newest Nikkor addition is the best . For the average amerture hobbiest this is a great lens to compliment any of the kit lenses .  
  Excellent . Has helped me at two locations , so far , over 3,000 miles a part from each other . Was easy to hook up and get it working and I 'm over 60 years old and getting slower with the new bells and whistles . I 'm learning new features about it every time I use it . I 'm thinking about getting one for my wife when we get back home . super . thanks of a good reliable product . It took the " angnst " out of being in a strange city and having to make an 8 am appointment though the rush hour . I 've found that it doesn't always know the short cuts , but its accuracy is mind boggling .  
  This is a great camera for a great price ! I 'm happy with it .  
  I gotta say this is the best printer I 've ever owned and for me , with having owned 7 different printers in my life so far that 's saying a lot . I used to be an Epson man , but this lil ' baby has changed my mind . I 've owned 4 Epson 900 's and a 1200 and now two of these Canons to date . All the Epsons died due to injet head clogging and I just got sick of tossing money down the drain and jumped ship with them . So I got two Canons instead . One for my studio and one for the kids . The Canon PIXMA iP6000D Photo Printer is whisper quiet when it prints , ( unlike the Epsons I 've owned ) prints out beautiful photos even on the plain paper setting ( unlike the Epsons I 've owned ) and even has a built-in card reader that you can view , crop AND print photos directly from in a snap ! I really like the fact that it has 6 ink cartridges instead of three because it ultimately saves a lot of ink for you . The software you install is cool too because it tells you and shows you visually how much ink is left in the cartridges which I love because you won't run out of ink the night before you 're set to pitch a big presentation . I have learned that ink takes a long time to drain out of the cartridge and sometimes even after the software has told me that the cartridge is out of ink , I can still print for a week or more ! Lastly it has an extra USB port on it 's front allowing you to daisy-chain another peripheral to it which can come in handy now and then . I highly recommend this printer whether you are a hobbyist , a business person or an artist ( which is what I am ) because it always has come through for me . Thanks Canon !  
  These speakers are affordable and fit perfectly with my audio set up in our apartment . I had acquired a stereo receiver at a garage sale during the summer and was looking for something that would go with it . I was told to find something that had a wooden cabinet , and I stumbled across these . They are perfectly loud enough for movies , gaming , and just about anything else you can think of . The range of the speakers is nice , and with a nice equalizer , i 'm sure you could dial in a setting that suits your needs . Bass is always important , and even without a subwoofer , these do the job nicely . Overall , if you looking for a budget pair of speakers that still provide great audio , these are right up your alley .  
  It was okay while it worked . Sound quality wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either and microphone quality was decent . The inline volume control and microphone switch were convenient . Unfortunately it didn't last . The main problem was the cord . Despite being rather thick it developed bad connections in many places . The volume control also became scratchy . Finally one of the drivers broke . Because of all these problems I cannot recommend this headset .  
  What nice sound in a little boom box . I bought it for CDs , the ear phones are comfortable and sound is great . The cassette player has better sound , both recording and playback than a cassette player alone at work , which cost the same price .  
  I read printer reviews out the ying yang before I bought this one , and then I bought this one . It is perfect for me . It is very easy to set up . It comes with a starter drum and toner cartridge that takes seconds to put in . The directions are clear . The paper is easy to load and hidden from plain view . The design is sleek , and looks very nice . It is lightweight and small which is awesome , and still has great resolution . My prints come out sharp and crisp . The printer comes with a cd , but my cd rom is broken , but it was no problem , as my computer 's printer wizard was able to locate the software online and install it within minutes . This printer is a spacesaver , a timesaver , and a moneysaver . The toner cartridges last 2500 pages , and are cheaper than others . I like printing pictures too , but for color photos , an inkjet printer is better than any laser . Buy this if you want to print great text , for a great price .  
  I had to replace my Linksys wireless G router due to the signal dropping all the time . The Belkin Pre-N got the highest rating at CNET so I thought I would give it it try . I could not be happier . The coverage area on this router is amazing . It was a breeze to setup and is mac compatible . Been using it for 3 weeks now and havent dropped the signal once . The pre-N is worth the extra money .  
  This is not " OPTEKA " . There is a huge " ZEIKOS " logo at the top of the case and I don't get how the seller missed it ( intentionally perhaps ) . Beware !  
  I did some research in looking for a good JB that would not break my budget . I have some friends that have the Dell DJ . So I looked at the Dell DJ , Zen Xtra and an Ipod . I decided to go with the Xtra . The reasons why ? 1 . Zen works with WMA files ( Ipod does not , which stopped my considering Apple ) 2 . Zen 's battery is easily to replace . Quick run to Radio Shack . ( Apple is proprietary ( expensive ) and Dell 's is not easy to get into ) 3 . Previously owned a Creative Jukebox 1 and have had great luck with it . Never had an issue with it . 4 . The price was $ 100 cheaper than Dell and $ 200 than Ipod . For around $ 200 on Amazon , I got a 30 gig unit . Try to find that with Dell or Apple . What I don't like about it .. 1 . Software that came with it is not great . It is not as bad as the original stuff that came with the JB1 , but Notmad by Red Chair solved that issue . Plan on an extra $ 25 to get it . Nice thing is that it is available for Ipod and Dell as well . Well worth the money regardless of which unit you buy ! 2 . Little wheel feels cheap compared to Dell 's , but no one has reported major issues with it . 3 . It is a little bigger in physical size than the other 2 . No big deal for me since I am not using it jogging or anything like that . I use mine for listening to music in the bedroom , car and office . Easy access to my music collection was my goal . I 've seen people complain that there is not a stop button on it . The Dell unit doesn't have one either . Both have a pause button which works fine for stopping the unit . I have not missed the stop at all . Hope these insights help others looking . I am very please with my purchase . Highly recommend it .  
  I purchased four of these controls for my home video studio . They worked well until I connected to 500 watt lamps to them . They are very susceptible to current spikes ( turning the lights on and off at full power ) . Needless to say I blew all four controllers . I ended up going to Lowe 's hardware and purchasing standard 110V lighting controls and built my own . Great solution ! I would not recommend these controllers unless it is a relatively low power application .  
  Extremely noisy - warms-up every time the telephone rings in anticipation it might be a fax coming-in . Sounds like a clothes dryer with several boots bouncing around inside . Can't hear the other party on the phone call because of it . Can't print from MACs - What 's my daughter supposed to do to print her Graphic Designer school work from her MAC . I was SHOCKED to find there are no drivers for MAC . I 've had a number of color printers in the past ( HP , Lexmark , and others - all of which had drivers / could be used from the MAC ) . Can't stop print jobs . It says you can , and accepts the input indicating print jobs are cancelled , but it just keeps spewing page after page anyway , and there is absolutely no way to stop it and move-on to another print job without allowing everything to print . My son accidentally sent a 100 pg + document to it one day , and I sent 19 pages just today when I really just wanted to print page 1 . There was no stopping it . I just pulled the paper tray out so it couldn't continue . You can unplug it .. and it will still resume and finish printing the whole job . There is absolutely no way to ever again print something else without letting it print the entire cancelled job 1st . I think Canon is hoping it 'll burn-up a lot of toner so they can sell you more . I should ship it back to Canon so it can resume printing there and keep them awake with all the noise .  
  Absolutely love this product ! It 's my third one . I was worried they weren't available any longer , but found it on Amazon . The thing I like the most is the mouse is always where you left it . And you don't run off the edge of your pad . It works like a normal mouse , using all the same figers , with the difference being you use your thumb instead of your wrist to move the pointer . Very nice ! Oh , and it fits nicely on a pull out shelf under your desk .  
  I 'm sure you could get lucky and not get one like I did , but the one I received couldn't hold a consistent charge . The camera would say the battery is full , yet after a few shots , it would show up as fully drained . I would take the battery out , put it back in , and again the same thing would happen . A couple of successful shots , then fully drained . I could maintain this for a very long time - almost as long as the battery SHOULD last ( week + ) , but this whole back-and-forth was unbearable . Meanwhile the same battery from Canon that I 've had for years still works good as new . tl ; dr : Don't be cheap like I was , go for a quality brand .  
  As others mentioned , the user interface is quite poor , but can be figured out after a little bit of work . I order the unit that is suppose to support wild-cards , but the one I received does not No model numbers or defining marking on it . Since I don't know all the numbers of the people I don't want bothering me , all I know is that they start with 800 or 888 I can't block them , so I have no choice but enter all the numbers I do want to go through and block all others . Not the best option . ( Actually I was contacted by the manufacturer to tell me that the blank spaces are wild-cards , not the asterisk ( *) that would be expected . Still it shows a very pro-active manufacturer . ) Anyway , decided to keep it and enter the numbers since I figured there wasn't that many . Well just family and a few friends , home , cell and office numbers gets to be a lot , especially when entering each number requires the use of up or down arrows to scroll through number 0 through 9 to choose the value needed . Also , each number has 14 digits , the area code must be entered , and the typical 4 extra digit locations must be blanked out to work . Even that wouldn't be too bad but the up / down arrow buttons are poor quality so they are bouncy frequently causing the digit desired to be missed . Ever use a TV remote or calculator when the buttons were going bad ? You got it . Also there are about 6 or 7 other keystrokes to get the needed number into the desired category of block , always through , or through at certain times . Also the categories need to have the times to let calls through entered in one hour increments to 24 hours , otherwise it doesn't work . Anyway after hooking it up and not entering my cell so I could try it , I called the house and it still rang one ring before blocking . Finally I was going to return it , but left it hooked up that night . The next day I needed to reach the house and dialed the number several times thinking the one ring would still be answered . Well it turns out that no ringing occurred . Somehow it had started to block all rings and not let the one get through , so I kept it . Now with all that is bad about the unit , it does a GREAT job not letting the troubling calls through . I am sure this is made in someone 's garage and larger companies won't touch the concept because of what it means , so if you want to get rid of those annoying marketers and survey takes and debt collectors , hook this up ! Just be prepared to spend some time with it . One interface aspect that was good was that when the call is block it shows up on a caller ID panel and with a couple keystrokes you can then save the number to the category you want it . That is a MUCH faster process . Our phone has been so quiet now that I have checked it a few times to make sure it 's working . The concept of what this does is great ! Especially with all the markets using computer dialing now . This is pretty much indispensable . I will definitely not be without something like this again , but would gladly pay more for better quality , easier interface and more features . - After using this for a month or so now I feel the hassle to get it set up is well worth it . Now when our phone rings I know it 's someone I want to speak with and don't even bother checking the caller ID anymore . Once it 's in and working this is really great to have .  
  This is the 2nd D-link Networking Product I 've purchased in the last several years and it was a big mistake again . The D-Link DIR-655 has a networking glitch that caused me major frustration to troubleshoot and finally just plain didn't work ( just like the WiFi Webcam I purchased a few years ago ) . If you have a printer with built-in Ethernet networking , steer clear of this product . I plugged my printer 's Ethernet cable directly into one of the router LAN ports , configured all settings as I have with 2 previous WiFi Routers ( Linksys and SMC ) , and while the printer appeared on the network ( responds to some IP address pings ) , none of my wired or wireless computers could print due to communications errors . I called D-Link support , and gosh were they horribly clueless . They forced me to speak to 3 different Level 1 support techs even though I asked for a more senior tech support rep ( because they kept asking me to do really dumb things to troubleshoot , and I clearly knew more networking basics than they did ) . I then got run through two Level 2 reps , at which point they gave up and told me to call in the next day for a L3 tech . I call in , ask for a L3 tech , get put on hold for 45 + mins ( when they told me it would take 2-3 minutes ) , and then a rep picks up saying " L2 support " . I explain to the L2 supervisor that I need a L3 rep , and after another 15 min hold , I finally get to a L3 tech who tries to troubleshoot , but is stumped as well and admits that " not many people who use their router have network-capable printers " . Somehow that is supposed to excuse how their product cannot seem to handle simple peer-to-peer 10/100 Ethernet networking ? Oh , and by the way , the main reason I got this product was to see if it would have better range and signal strength than my Linksys WRT54GS .. and it didn't . Still only 2 bars in my kitchen less than 50 ft away . I 'm returning it today , and in the future , I 'm avoiding D-link products like the plague .  
  The good : This camera takes very nice photos . It 's small and easy to tote around . It 's also loaded with neat features like IS , a 6x zoom , view finder , as well as different scene modes . These modes are for night , sporting , and landscape settings as needed . It makes life a little easier for point and shoot photographers . In addition you can play around with various color settings and really take artistic pictures . It also has full manual mode which is a truly great feature to have on any camera . The canon software is also decent . The photostich app is a handy way of doing panoramics without using a photoshop type program . On the downside canon only gives you a 16mb SD card which can only hold about 4 high resolution shots . Considering that prices are dropping on these cards it 's almost an insult . But that 's not so much a criticism of the camera . My only real gripe with the camera itself is that the flash recycles painfully slow . I had read that this was true and thought this might be an exaggeration . It is not . The good news is that this camera takes extremely good low light photos so if you 've got decent indoor lighting you can take nice interior shots without really needing the flash in the first place . While image quality is very good I was a little disappointed . I have an old canon S30 3.2 mp and I did some comparisons . While the 710 did shoot noticeably higher resolution it didn't blow me away with clarity compared to 3.2 mp . I thought the difference would be more dramatic then it actually is . My old S30 was a very high quality camera and there is a lot to be said for optics . But the 710 is a very good camera . Considering that you can get it now for well under $ 300 it 's really a bargain for a camera to does so much so well . If the flash rate was better I would easily give it 5 stars . Maybe I 'm expecting too much from a compact camera under $ 300.00 . Still , the flash is just about useless for multiple shots .  
  This item is very convenient for my purpose . It works great ! 4 months ago , I moved my computer to an adjacent room . The room doesn't have a cable drop so I tried wireless routers and adapters ( used a couple of brands , one after the other ) . That didn't work well for me due to some minor glitches that occurred every now and then . Fully recommended .  
  As a medical doctor somewhat unwillingly dragged in IT by the accidents of life , I suffer from frequent bouts of nostalgia , remembering fondly the time where I was studying life sciences . That 's during one of those episode that I bought this gadget , thinking it would probably end up gathering dust on a shelve . Boy , I was wrong ! The microscope is so light and well designed that it can be taken anywhere . It is up and running in a few seconds , it 's waterproof and it is sturdy . Its optical quality is beyond reproach . But what really stunned me is the sheer amount of interesting things the 20x magnification is putting within my reach : seemingly uninteresting insects such as aphids offer are seen tantalizing amount of detail ; closely watching a dining spider is something you will not forget soon . In the vegetal world , patterns seem to pop out of nowhere . This is also an incredible educational toy for children since it turns the most basic garden into a giant natural history museum . One caveat , but not an unexpected one : since it is designed to be extremely light , no light source is provided . A white led connected to a cheap 5V supply can be helpful in low light conditions .  
  My daughter and I both bought the SmartShopper , a voice activated grocery list and organizer . We are both equally impressed . For her , it is a great convenience . For me , it has almost become a necessity . I have hand tremors , and being able to voice my selections rather than writing them is a must . The voice recognition is good for both of us . Our husbands don't have the the interest to use it as much , but that 's okay . We love it ! I have not tried to train it to recognize unknown products , but my daughter has . That will be my next project . The only negative I can see is the price . Some would say it is on the pricey side . So shop for price , too . And don't forget the additional refill tapes . Your SmartShopper comes with refills , but you may want more .  
  I was using a Linux based product known as netMax . The netMax box worked great , but didn't support active FTP . This product does support active FTP . It is very easy to configure and hasn't given me any trouble , ever . I also have several friends that use it . They say the same thing . I would highly recomend this product ! Its only possible drawback is that it only allows one host to be bound to the outside , not a problem for most users . Sincerely Carson Lattimore  
  The Best of the BestMy preference : 3rd . The Sennheiser IE 8 ( $ 450 ) . 2nd . Shure SE535 ( $ 550 ) . 1st . Westone TrueFit 4 ( $ 450 ) . These three earphones rank among the very best-or at least the most expensive-universal-fit earphones . Are these $ 500 ear-candies worth their asking prices ? Which one is the best ? Below is a detailed comparison of these three earphones and the reasons for my ranking . Four more affordable earphones are also suggested for their better sonic fit and values for IPods , cell phones and the likes . LESS EXPENSIVE CHOICES . To the questions above , there are unfortunately no simple answers . If you listen to mostly MP3 and other compressed recordings , you are probably wasting your money and missing most of the virtues of these $ 500-earphones . There are far more affordable earphones in the range of $ 50 to $ 80 that , on IPods and similar devices , will sound almost as good as their far-more-expensive brethrens . Three very good models to check out are , in my increasing order of preference : 3 . The SoundMagic PL50 Noise Isolating In-Ear Monitor Earphones ( $ 50 ) - Yep , these unassuming Chinese earphones are worth every penny . 2 . The Audio-Technica ATHCK7 titanium earphones ( $ 80 ) . 1 . The NuForce NE-700X Audiophile-Grade Earphones ( $ 65 ) . The ATHX-CK7 and NE-700 in-ear devices provide adequate " passive " noise-isolation in my opinion-far better than most headphones-but if you want a choice for " active " sound isolation , the Audio Technica ATH-ANC23 with Active Noise-Canceling ( $ 75 ) will do very nicely albeit with a small sacrifice to the sound with the noise cancellation switched on . COMMON SHORTCOMING . If you listen to CDs or other high-quality sources , it is worthwhile to check out the sound of high-price earphones . I have lived with them for over a year now and have become familiar with their near - and long-term virtues and shortcomings-yes , even at half-a-grand a pop , these earphones are not perfect . A shortcoming shared by all of them : you hear the sound emanating mostly from the middle of your forehead due to a collapsed soundstage ( the perceived size of the space in which the recording took place ) . Unless you have a signal processor like the HeadRoom Total Airhead ( $ 99 ) just to name one choice among many other models to create a wider , more credible sound stage , you are stuck with the sound collapsing in the middle of your forehead . COMPARISON CRITERIA . To facilitate the comparison of relative sonic merits of these earphones , I will compare them one sonic attribute at a time . Overall tonal balance : this is the general sonic impression you get from both short-term and long-term listening . Clarity : overall perception of the details of the sound , the absence of veiling across the frequency range ( lows , midrange , highs ) . Bass : quality , quantity , depth and control of the low frequencies . Highs : quality and extension of the high frequencies . Use comfort : how well the ear buds fit and how comfortable they are with long-term listening . Note : frequently , the quality of the sound , especially the bass , depends on the sensitivity of earphones and the quality of the amplification . I found that an inexpensive earphone-amplifier like the HeadRoom Total Airhead ( $ 99 ) - not the last word in sound quality but very serviceable-can improve the sound of all three earphones evaluated even though , to my ears , it did not change their relative ranking . Here are brief descriptions of these sonic attributes followed by my rating ( 0-100 ) of the three top earphones listed in my order of increasing preference . Third . Sennheiser IE 8 ( $ 450 ) Overall tonal balance : slightly lean , very detailed though not analytical , just slightly lacking in warmth - 92Clarity : well articulated sound , free from colorations across the entire frequency range - 95Bass : very tight bass with excellent definition and timber ; slightly short on quantity and impact - 90Highs : extended highs free of harshness or stridency - 95Use comfort : well shaped , excellent fit with my ears ; could benefit from memory-foam buds - 93Overall : 93Second . Shure SE535 ( $ 549 ) Overall tonal balance : lush and very musical if slightly lacking in inner details - 95Clarity : slightly veiled in the mid-range ; not the last words in articulation - 93Bass : thunderous bass with great impact but somewhat lacking in tightness - 95Highs : extended , smooth highs with good details - 95Use comfort : excellent fit with my ears though large size & shape took some getting used to - 92Overall : 94First . Westone TrueFit 4 ( $ 450 ) Overall tonal balance : smooth across the full range ; finely detailed and well balanced sound - 98Clarity : clean , dynamic sound with good detail and musicality - 98Bass : excellent bass , very tight and well-defined without boominess in the upper bass - 94Highs : extended , smooth , silky highs with - 95Use comfort : excellent fit with my ears ; good choices of ear-buds - 95Overall : 96COMPROMISE . As you can see , not much separates these three earphones . None of them is perfect and your choice will come down to your taste and preference in sound , what qualities you prefer and what flaws you can or cannot live with . If you value subtle inner details and clarity above all and can live with a slight deficiency in bass , the Sennheiser IE 8 is a clear winner . If you prefer a lot of bass and impact in your music , the Shure SE535 is the best choice . For a good balance of details , dynamic impact and musicality , the Westone TrueFit 4 reigns supreme . Depending on your personal sonic preference , you could have ranked these earphones in a completely different order than mine . A word of caution : how earphones fit you plays a much more important role than most realize : a poor fit will cause discomfort in the long run but , just as important , it will significantly degrade the sound quality . These earphones sound their best only with a proper fit . Unfortunately , ear lobes and ear canals are shaped differently from preson to person so you have to try these earphones on-does any dealer let you do that ? - to be certain of how they will fit you . Finally , it is rather silly to compare relative value of these top earphones : if you can afford and are willing to shell out $ 500 for a pair of earphone , $ 100 difference in price should not be an issue . CONCLUSION . Are these $ 500 earphones worth their asking price ? Yes , if you demand the very best sound from earphones and your playback equipment and recording can do them justice . The winner for me is the Westone TrueFit by a nose . If you listen to MP3 on IPods or cell phones , you can still hear the difference between these expensive models and the more modestly-priced models but you are far from hearing all that these earphones can really do . A far less expensive choice and better match may be found among the following earphones : SoundMagic PL50 ( $ 50 ) ; Audio Technica ATH-ANC23 ( $ 75 ) ; Audio-Technica ATHCK7 titanium earphones ( $ 80 ) ; NuForce NE-700X Audiophile-Grade Earphones ( $ 65 ) .  
  Have used it now for about 3 months with no issues . Have a printer , External USB Hard drive and USB TV Tuner connected . Also use it for a 16 gb flash drive and my iphone . I would buy it again .  
  Great little speakers for the price . Does not charge the ipod like they say they will . Great sound and very portable . I bought sets for home and work though so I don't have to carry them around . Recommended product !  
  - None of the computers I connected the USB were able to recognize the hard drive . - There is no manufacturer phone number available with the item . - I called beyond micro no one picks up the phone not even voice mail . - Had to pay the shipping charges for both delivery and return .  
  I waited a long time to order the salad shooter because finances were tight and the time didn't seem right . Finally , I ordered it and now all my slicing and shredding dreams are coming true before my very eyes . It used to take me forever to cut up veggies for soups , so I often didn't get around to it as much as I would have liked . With the salad shooter , I now pop in whole onions , potatoes , carrots , parsnip , celery , squash , cabbage , and whatever else I can think of , and just shoot it right into my slow cooker . I top it with chicken or beef , herbs and other seasonings and just walk away for several hours . Before you know it , I have beautiful soup to eat and share with my friends . ( I 'm becoming very popular these days since I got my salad shooter , I kid you not . ) I hate slicing onions and now I no longer have to . The only two complaints I have about this product is that it only slices and shreds , but doesn't chop foods . However , if you don't mind things in a sliced shape , then this probably won't affect you . The other thing is that I wish it could slice a little bit thicker slices . The directions indicate that it takes practice and that each time you use it will be easier . This is true and my results continue to be better each time . I LOVE this product and believe that every household should have one . You won't regret it !  
  First : Read all reviews BEFORE you buy . " Doing your homework " is not the same as " yeah I 'll just read the positive reviews and buy this " . LET THE " DISLIKE " VOTES GET BIGGER NOW . Second : Everything said about the parts is true . Barlow , lenses , finder and ( less so ) the mount , are worthless . Third : Prepare to spend just as much for the " real " parts as the hole scope itself , maybe even more . Fourth : Even after spending about $ 200 on top of this , the best Jupiter looks is like a small dot ( 6.4mm plus nice Barlow also multi-coated ) , Fifth : If you are a total noob like me , you will only get enjoyment out of howlin ' at the moon . YOU ARE WARNED . PS . Starry Night is so much better than the software they give you . I 'm learning alot about astronomy through my books .  
  This is truly the best you can get for the price . I thought I was stealing lol . Would definitely buy again .  
  Palm is great . They have some really good handhelds . The E is my third handheld . I bought it because I was interested in PalmOS 5 , playing video and sounds , and the resolution of the screen . was 320x320The cpu inside this thing is fast . You can view photos , listen to mp3s , and manage addresses , etc .. It is almost like having a desktop computer in the palm of your hand ! If you have an older model that is not based on the ARM processors , I would think about getting an E model , or even one of the higher end models . You will notice a huge increase in speed and features !  
  This is a great bag that holds the right amount of pieces for a day trip . It can be over the shoulder or used as a fanny pack leaving both hands and arms free for catching that perfect shot . Build quality is very good . A unique feature is the main compartment opens against your body and not away from it .  
  This product is a life saver on a long trip ! We appreciate the voices , the clarity of the screen , and the real help in navigating . We are satisfied customers and have recommended it to our friends .  
  I just got this player and its everything i expected it to be . it has a blue blacklight , remote control , and though its not quite as flashy as the ipod , its the closest in terms of looks , its not as mediocre as the dell dj , and its smaller than the zen touch mp3 player . it takes just seconds to download songs , great product and i reccomend it to anyone  
  I installed this just over the weekend and it was very easy to install and it works wonderful . It gives a very wide view .  
  Note that a newer model of this unit on now available , the Panasonic DMR-ES20 . It seems to be the same as the ES10 , except that they 've now added a firewire input . For some reason this unit is not yet available on Amazon ( as of 9.22.05 ) , but I just bought the ES20 at Best Buy ( the ES10 was on clearance there , as I believe that model is now discontinued ) . I love this machine .  
  Aesthetically it looks beautiful ! It 's a little heavy , if you 're used to the small flash player types , which I 'm upgrading from . I started years ago with a mini disk player and loved it , but hated how I had to " record " everything to it instead of either burning or syncing , so I went for the iRiver MP3 CD Player and used that for a couple of years . Loved it ! Then I bought a 512MB Samsung Yep . It was very nice for about 6 months and then everything I put on it had an annoying clicking noise for accompaniment . So I ditched it and went big with the Zen Sleek . It took about 5 minutes to get 1500 songs on it , and I guess I still have room for about 8000 more . Navigation is very simple . Sort through artist , album or all music , listed alphabetically . Be sure to update all you ID Tags in MP10 1st . Radio reception is very strong . Haven't tried recording using the mic yet . Photo 's uploaded easily , but contrary to the Amazon description I haven't been able to listen to music while I browse my photos yet , but that 's not too important as photo viewing is just a bonus to an mp3 player anyway . The only thing I 'm worried about is the screen . I wish they made a case that had a protective screen built in , but unfortunatley I cannot find that many cases , other than the leather pouch and rubber skins for this player . I 'd say if you 're looking for an easy to use player , with photo , radio and recording ability , this is THE PLAYER at Amazon 's current $ 169 price . Something with 20 gig 5 years ago would have cost us $ 2000 . It 's just incredibe how prices of high tech drop so fast . I always say buy the best from the last couple years and you 'll be very happy , or get the latest and pay twice as much .  
  This flash is well worth the money . I take pictures for our school yearbook and we have many times had a hard time getting good pictures inside buildings even with the camera I have . I own the P850 . We purchased this for our graduation ceremony this year and it took BEAUTIFUL pictures indoors . We are a small christian school and the graduation is held inside the church . There are many parts where there is little to no light and from a distance , I was able to get great shots !  
  This Belkin Surge Protector gives you a Warranty on any item plugged into this Surge Protector . Great Quality and Price .  
  GREAT QUALITY , QUICK SHIPPING , COULDN'T BE ANY BETTER THAN THEY DESCRIBED IT .  
  OK , if you 're here , you probably have read all the online reviews . Here 's my answers to some of the major criticisms I 've seen about this supurbe camera on the web . ( And my opinion is based on a 20 year career as a professional photographer .. for what that 's worth ! :) ) 1 . ) Criticism : Memory card is hard to remove . OK , maybe this could use a little work on Pentax 's part . Not really a big deal if you 're careful . Just be careful .. it 's not THAT hard ! 2 . ) Criticism : Batteries are not proprietary and rechargeable ! ? WHAT ? THANK GOD ! This is in my opinion not a mistake but a MAJOR PLUS ! Only Pentax would have the forsight and understanding to give the user TWO ( more if you consider all the AA posibilities .. ) onboard options for battery power both available almost anywhere for Pete 's sake ! Batteries are the life blood of digital photography , more options can only be better ! For my part I 'm running 2300 milliamp hour rechargable AA 's and am thrilled with the performance ! Well that addresses the two biggies I 've read about . As for the rest of it , the price is now where it should be and the camera performs fantastically . Now that Pentax has a 14mm coming out , all is wonderful in the digital world . My advice , BUY IT and you won't ever look back ! The 13x19 prints are superb , I shoot weddings and fine art landscapes , and this camera gets the job done !  
  I 've owned video cameras since my first Hitachi VHS in the 80 's . This is the sharpest camera yet . I will be selling my Canon Optura DV , JVC GR-DVP3U and Sony Digital 8 to use this exclusively . The video picture quality is astounding , as is the low light performance . I added the wide angle lens and video light for an overall nice package . The digital still capability is useless compared to a real digital camera even in the same 1.5 megapixel rating . Still pictures look ' TV like ' , but the video sharpness just has me keeping the camera . I 'm sure the 330 is even a better improvement , but I 'd still be suspicious of the still picture performance .  
  I 'm honestly surprised to see so many positive reviews of this product since I thought it was garbage as soon as I removed it from the box . I didn't really have great expectations of this cooler , but bought it .. extremely cheap plastic , what sounded to me like underpowered fan motors and probably the only redeeming feature it had to it per cooling , was that it raised the bottom of your notebook at an angle . I would definitely NOT recommend this product .  
  The quality of this sound product is TERRIBLE ! The bass speaker might as well not even be attached because the first volume level pretty much blows it out . I would rather not have sound than use these speakers .  
  WOW ! Regular XBOX worked great with no setup needed . Plug it in , connect network cable to xbox and away you go . Down side .. I couldn't get it to work with my XBOX 360 , the reason I bought it . Ok the redeemer in this is it works for playstation and on some computers ( not with vista ) un plugging and moving to different item , no problem . Oh the biggest find is when I hooked it to my DISHNETWORK box and with just going to the network setup on the dishnetwork box it found the network right away . Oh range .. at least 45 away ( 3 rooms with metal studs ) still a good signal . A 5 star rating for this product , d-link got it right .  
  Unit works very well .. Not one problem yet .. Product came well recommended by a tech for a cable company .. Price was also very reasonable  
  This was a gift for my daughter for her 13th birthday . We had it out last night for the second time for our first serious attempt at observation . Sky alignment is a snap and my daughter performed last night 's alignment with me talking her through it . After the controller indicated a successful alignment , my daughter selected Saturn and the mount went to work and locked on to Saturn with minimal manual slewing to center the planet in the eyepiece . We swapped out eyepieces from 32mm all the way down to 4mm ( the scope only comes with 25 & 9mm as advertised .. we bought the 1.25 " eypiece / filter / Barlow kit ) . At 25mm with a 2x Barlow the rings of Saturn barely began to emerge . But by the time we hit 4mm w / Barlow the rings were pronounced and crisp , the planet was resolved to a nice-sized disc , and as a bonus two of Saturn 's moons were visible . The only difficulty in using this scope is in understanding and achieving collimation ( alignment of the optics ) . I ordered the Celestron collimation eyepiece at the same time as the scope and other accessories . I am a manufacturing laser operater and deal with optics alignment several times on any work day . The instruction sheet included with the collimation eyepiece did little to instill confidence and I found myself alternately reviewing the instructions and staring through the pinhole of the eyepice for more than an hour before I started turning screws . I had to collimate the scope right out of the box as it shipped with loose primary mirror locking screws . One week later ( yesterday ) I found that both the primary and secondary mirrors had shifted and another collimation was necessary . The secondary mirror adjustments are very difficult compared to the primary which are quite easy after overcoming the initial anxiety . I was at it for quite a while again . I must have done well as indicated by such sharp focus on Saturn 's rings and no perceptible wandering of stars during de-focusing . But you will have to collimate , so get a collimating eyepiece with this kind of telescope . Perhaps a laser-equipped collimator would make the process easier ?  
  As an engineer , consultant , businessman , and educator - pramatism ( bang per buck ) absolutely rules . No question - having suffered dozens of daily crashes with the latest PCs and Microsoft software , hundreds of OS updates , crippled unreliable Dell and IBM laptops ( yet working in aerospace , space and formula one ) - I am so P * sed off with the quality ( lack thereof ) in IT ( 17 years worth ! ) .. Count the hours wasted and dollars spent on software .. To the new Apple - within 5 minutes it was connected to the Internet , talking with all the printers , scanners , faxes , gamespads , videocams without any hitch whatsoever ( REAL WOW ) . OK so OSX looks scary - 30 minutes to get used to without even looking at the straightfoward manual . Appleworks free office suite reads all my papers and articles without a glitch even though they were written ( and crashed ) in MS Office . Some software updates - quick with a disk optimiser automatically ( no fragmented disks .. ) . Speedwise an iMac G5 1.6 / 512MB RAM / 160 GB HD / 17 screen boots up and feels about 3 x faster than a Dell Inspiron Laptop / Pentium 4 1.6/512MB RAM / 30GB HD / 16VRAM / 15 Screen . Never mind the cool factor or that an equivalent Dell costs more .. I even have to move my head from side to side as the screen is so big ! Moans - more power would be great ( e.g. better graphics card options , dual processor option ) but in reality the iMac is such such a marvel of industrial design in the true sense , doesn / t crash all day , and works very effectively at a great price . BTW I did a factory 1 slot 512MB option so that could 3rd party upgrade another 512 more cost effectively - but am told that the 2 slots do not need to match in size . Overall - a real winner - My * New * Dell laptop has become a paperweight holding a cable ! UPDATE ( a few days later ) - everyone who has seen and used the new iMac wants one ; I * want to * use the computer ( fun ! ) rather than dread it ( Windows ) ; think that office productivity - languishing despite vast IT investments - may rebound if coporations were brave enough to invest in one of these for all staffers .. ( not one crash in 40 hours use - a record ! ) . BTW may start to put in some industrial strength engineering modelling apps soon ( with a second new Mac - a Dual PowerMac 3GHz when it comes ) ..

  After reading the product reviews , especially some of the early ones , I was a bit concerned about buying this product . As noted by most reviewers , the documentation is several notches below bad . And as noted by some reviewers , the product works as advertised . I installed this product on a home network . I preformed the initial configuration , as described on the FAQ ( website ) , from a Linux box . I have tested the server with HP LaserJet 4 ( parallel ) and an HP DeskJet 990Cxi ( USB ) . Host systems configured and tested include Linux ( RedHat 7.3 , 8.0 and 9 , Debian ) , Windows XP Pro , Windows 2000 and OpenBSD . After testing all these platforms , I upgraded the firmware to the latest release available from the web site . I can't comment on the tech support , but the web site is not all that great . I have used the server for a week , and I am very pleased with the performance .  
  I was surprised how tough these little critters are . I got it initially because I did some travelling and needed something small and light . My 2 boys ( 3 and 5 ) started using it ( because it fits their hands ) to play games and I wasn't sure how long it was going to last and they can be very rough with it . You know little kids when they get excited or frustrated with computer games ! To my surprised , its been nearly a year and it is still alive and well and they used it most every day ! I bought my wife one and she loves it and I ended up getting an extra one for myself for travel purposes . Yes , it may be a little small for my hand but not totally uncomfortable and it does its job . I even used it through one complete code / programming project .  
  I like it because it has a rubber outside and water proof it ws a great buy and I might buy another one  
  I bought this for my new Dell Inspiron E1505 . This case is perfect for it . It has allot of space to hold extra stuff as well . No negatives I can see . Shipping was fast . Great to do business with !  
  A high-performance , high quality filter . The results will speak for themselves : exceptional depth and clarity for most outdoor photography . One of the best available .  
  The first time i used this night scope i was a little disapointed as i didn't read the instructions , i just put the battery in and pressed a button , but later on when i pressed the IR button .. WOW , i am amazed by the results , my garden is about 160 feet long and even in total darkness i can put the IR on and clearly make out any objects / animals that are in the garden . Here in the uk they charge about $ 450 dollars for this item , I managed to get this model in the Seben Make for about $ 175 dollars ( inc . Delivery from Germany ) . It is exactly the same model , my mate has the Night Owl Version , and we have compared , they even have similar Serial numbers . P.s . No matter what Night Owl say these are Designed and made in Russia , not the USA .  
  Ok so I have read mixed reviews of the Zune . After having it for a couple of months , I must say , I 'm quite satisfied . I 'm definitely not an iPod type of person so I definitely wanted to check out the Zune while Amazon was having a black Friday special of $ 89.99 . I couldn't just let this deal pass me . I love all the features Zune has . A lot of people complain about Zune 's software and I don't have any complaints . ( I complain a lot too . ) I think the battery life is awesome . The radio is definitely a plus . I haven't seen one of those on an iPod . Overall , I think that the Zune is definitely worth the money that it 's selling for .  
  The ipod is better than I expected . I am amazed at the technology of it . It has more options than I first thought . The size and weight couldn't be any better for me because I run every other day . It is also easy to put music into my ipod .  
  I had an excellent shopping experience ! Product was exactly as it was described . Will definitely shop with again . Good bye .  
  The charger is very good , but the problem is that the batteries do not retain their charge if kept idle . can someone help me to get a longer life for the charged battery . Vishu Kashyap , San Jose  
  Wonderful product , took me about 10 minutes to set it up . Works like a dream . Our tv had gotten complicated with a DVD / VCR combo to watch VHS & regular tv and a Stereo / DVD to watch DVDs in surround sound . We were always switching remotes between the TV , DVD / VCR , & Stereo / DVD . But the Logitech Harmony 550 took care of all of that . I got to put all the other remotes away . And the best thing about it is that it doesn't matter if you leave it on the couch & it gets sat on or if a 3-year old gets ahold of it & starts pushing random buttons IT CANNOT BE ACCIDENTALLY REPROGRAMMED . It can only be programmed or reprogrammed through the software installed on the computer . Genius ! I definitely recommend !  
  I purchased this specific unit because the TiVo forums recommended this unit as one that works well in helping to wirelessly connect the TiVo S3 to my home network . It was easy to install ( plug and play ) . Shortly after attaching this unit to the TiVo and going through the setup on the GUI , my TiVo was connected to my network . Overall setup time was less than 20 minutes . Since then I 've been enjoying the network functionality of my TiVo ( viewing my digicam pics on my TV , using the MP3 jukebox , and downloading program guides via the internet , etc . ) In the 3.5 months since I implemented , I have not had to reset the unit once . For my application , this unit works really well , although it may not be a great fit for others with different applications . In my opinion , this would a bulky unit to attach to a laptop for mobile computing , but could be a cost effective solution if you were to attach it to desktop .  
  I am very satisified with the value for the money of this GPS . It is very accurate and takes just minutes to find satellites . The voice prompts are clear and easy to understand . Warns you in plenty of time of approaching turns ( IE : " In 1000 feet turn right " ) as well as a tone and another direction when you get to the turn ( " turn right " ) The display is very bright and easy to read . It shows the name of the road you are travelling on near the bottom and the name of the road you will make the next turn on at the top . So even though it does not tell you the name of the road , like some higher end units , ( IE : instead of saying " Turn right onto Oak Drive " , the Nextar unit says " turn right " ) , it is still easy to glance over and see the name of the road . It also shows the estimated arrival time and the distance to your destination . One minor glitch is that it sometimes tells you to bear right or left , when really you are just following the same road , but maybe passing another intersection . But a look at the display will show you to remain on that road . The stopover feature is a plus , as you can enter more than one destination at a time , travel to each one and then continue on . Touchscreen and stylus are great easy to pan and zoom . You don't have to use the stylus , your finger works well too . I haven't tried the remote , but I guess it is a nice feature if you need that sort of thing . My son said he would use it from the back seat to mess me up and make me drive to Gamestop instead of the Dentist ! A complaint I have about the display is that the farthest out it zooms is 10 miles . Therefore , you cannot get a really good overview of your trip or where you are in relation to other nearby cities . Kind of frustrating , since it is such a nice unit , that limitation could be frustrating . I guess we 'll have to keep the paper maps for that . While I haven't fully tested many of the POI 's , what I did look at and use , seem accurate . Maybe not every restaurant and shopping place listed , but enough if you were in a strange city to be helpful . I especially like the ATM and Hospital POI 's . They could be very useful . Lastly , you cannot save any " waypoints " by the logitude and latitude coordinates and you cannot set any destinations that are not on a road . For example , I tried to set a destination in the middle of a park , but it then attached it to the nearest road . This makes the Nextar good for auto navigation only , and not hiking , boating or geocaching . Too bad , cause it is a very compact unit , and if it had just that feature , it 'd be great ! I looked at Magellan crossover units that will do both , but they are much more money and they are bulkier than this Nextar . So for the price , this unit is a very good value , and I can afford to get a cheap handheld unit for those uses . All in all a surprisingly good unit for the money .  
  It 's a CD sleeve - it does what it 's supposed to do . The colors make it a little bit of extra fun . Good and cheap casing solution for a photographer like me ! Easy to sleeve a CD and give to my client .  
  Not a whole lot to say about a filter cover . It is pinch operated , it fits , and it works as it should .  
  Got this for my Bushnell Compact Binoculars , whose bag had worn out . This bag is really well made and is compact but still fits my binoculars . It & # 8217 ; s a bit roomier than I need , but I can stick a few other things in the main compartment when I go to a football game . The bag is very lightweight and the nylon is good quality . Great product .  
  I don't understand how something so simple could go so wrong . The problem with this device is that I wasn't able to fully plug anything 3.5mm into it . My headphones would only go halfway in . Same with the Gogrove . This should be a no-brainer . I could hear audio with it half-way plugged in , but they just fall out . I tried pushing very firmly , but nothing would fully enter the connector from either side . I had purchased 4 of these , but I 'm returning all of them .  
  I picked the 785EXP based on other users ' positive feeback and ( my small budget ) pricing while being concerned after years using of only HP ~ [ cost ] inkjet models . The highest quality output of this Epson is well beyond the best of my HP units . Even the 1400 dpi mode using matte paper makes me happy every time . Vivid contrasting of colors help make the digital darkroom efforts worth every moment . I even love the sounds it makes grabbing the paper and during printing . ( Then again I love to hear my modem working too ! ) Although Epson recommends single sheet feed of heavier papers , ( sometimes I don't ) it has never missfead any of the many brands and types tried . ( HP Well .. hmm .. Love cleaning out jammed ex-photo paper , while being scared that it will never work again ? ) I was very concerned after reading several negative " users comments " and have found most to be unique to their situations . Things as " too many choices " in the printer driver outputs ( I love choices ! ) " Too hard to install " and " slow to start printing " I had no problems like that . I did have problems with USB device conflicts during printing causing lost communications errors or stopped printing until I unplugged the USB cable on the HP Deskjet that was not powered at that time . I have experienced problems of this sort with many USB devices that have proven to be OS related as well as the mix of software / equipment drivers on a given system . I wanted to write this to share my opinion and say this is a great printer ! Maybe not as fast as some more expensive units but great value and quality . Plus it prints pictures so well that it motivates one to get the camera out and take more and if possible even better pictures !  
  I ordered a Nikon MH-61 battery charger from " Savings 365 " via Amazon Marketplace . I believe it is a counterfeit item . I previously bought one of these chargers through a Nikon dealer and needed a second . Here 's how they differ : Savings 365 : 1-foot cordNikon : 6-foot cordSavings 365 : Power light comes on solidly immediately . Does not appear to go off ( at least , within 12 hours ) Nikon : Power light blinks when you insert a depleted battery . Power light turns solid when charging completes . Savings 365 : Told me to give at least 8 hours for a charge . Nikon : Complete charge takes 2 hours . Savings 365 : Product appears to be a Nikon brand label , but is subtly different . Unfortunately , I threw the packaging away when I packed this item in my camera bag before use . So I don't know if product packaging is similar to true Nikon packaging . I contacted Nikon customer support and they say the design of this charger has not changed . So it appears that Savings 365 sent a counterfeit Nikon brand charger . I do not know if it was intentional or if they were also defrauded . I have returned the charger for a refund , which I am still awaiting , but they did credit me some money for return shipping . So we will see . I would give a 5-star review to my original bonafide Nikon charger , so don't let this review stop you from buying one from an authorized Nikon dealer .  
  Bought this for my daughter Christmas 2010 . Good Netflix interface . However , just found out from her the the unit will not play blu-ray DVDs any more ( only 17 months of minimal DVD use ) - both Inception and Thor blu-ray DVDs give read error message , though non-blu-ray plays OK . ( Both discs play OK on a Panasonic model I bought from Amazon Christmas 2011 for $ 89 ) . I 'll update this review when I find out repair estimate from Samsung .  
  I was so excited for this unit , only to find that it wasn't the quality I expected . First , the FM transmitter only works in the Car Dock ( not included ) so if you want to use it at home , make sure your stereo has audio jacks or an aux jack . Second , the product was defective . My songs on the MP3 repeat sometimes and the headphone jack is faulty causing the sound to cut out and sound bad unless you hold the cord into the unit . This happens with both the MP3 and the XM sat radio - so I know it isn't reception . Samsung offered to repare it but the tech support is awful and unknowledgable . We 'll see what happens .  
  4 out 5 stars - a good reciever for the price and $ 200 dollars cheaper than best buy . To save much time and aggravation however - please remember that you won't get sound with just the HDMI wire connection - you must add an audio ( optical / etc .. ) wire hook up as well . Pioneer VSX-917V-K Home Theater Receiver ( Black )  
  I already had the hood that came with the 55-200mm VR lens but I wanted to check this one since it has a nicer shape . The first flaw I noticed was it 's locking system , it feels very flimsy and cheap compared to my other Nikon hoods . Another deal breaker was that putting the hood in reverse ( in storage position ) I couldn't close the lens completely . I sent it back for a refund and I 'll stay with the one that came with the lens , it might not be as cool looking as this one but it works and works well .  
  I based this purchase on customer reviews , and I was not disappointed : this is a great pair of headphones ! My previous pair was the Jensen JW160 's . The Jensens grip your head like a vice , and after a couple of hours , you have a nasty headache and marks in your head . The sound of the Jensens is good , don't get me wrong , but they are not even in the same league as these Acoustic Research ( AR 's from herein ) . When I first put on the AR 's , they moved a bit and I was afraid that since they did not grip my head that I would lose sound . This was only because I had become used to the Jensens and the discomfort associated with them . The AR 's are very soft , very comfortable , and after 10 minutes , I did not even know that I had them on . The sound is phenomenal , as well . An additional bonus over my Jensens is that the AR 's come with rechargeable batteries , and the base that comes with the AR 's is a charging base for the batteries . All you have to do is sit the headphones down into the base , and it charges . If you want a pair of very comfortable , great-sounding wireless headphones , look no further than these AR 's . And to boot they are very inexpensive ( if you don't believe me , look around at some of the top of the line wireless headphones on here ) . I will be buying another pair for my home theater .  
  I just got this comp from Amazon and so far I like it . However , there are a few things I found out after it arrived that I didn't expect . For one , Amazon says it has 7 USB 2.0 ports , while HP ( according to their website ) says it has 6 . Apparently , neither can count beyond a 1st grade level because my machine has 5 ( 1 in the front and 4 in the back ) . Ok , maybe that was a bit harsh , but the point is I paid a pretty penny for this unit and I expect it to come as advertised . More to the point , Amazon says it has 3 FireWire ports , mine only has 2 ( 1 in the front and 1 in the back ) , at least the HP website agrees with me on this . Also , Amazon says max RAM is 2 GB , while HP says max RAM is 1 GB ( 2 slots that can take 512 MB each ) . I 'd like to think Amazon is right in this regard , more RAM is always nice , but what if I buy two 1 GB cards and the machine won't accept it ? So , there you go . A very fast machine that flys through everything I 've thrown at it ( so far ) . I can't attest to its reliability because I 've only had it for 2 weeks , but if the past is any indication , HP should hold up under pressure . I had been extensively using a PII 450 MHz HP up until this point ( 5 years ) , and it 's still going strong as my secondary computer ; never had a major malfunction with it ! One last thing , total hard drive memory may be 120 GB , but upon first activation I only had a net of around 99 GB . Apparently , this thing comes jam packed with 21 Gigs of programs ( most of the good ones you 'll have to pay extra online for full or continuing activation ) and a partition dedicated to system recovery . Yikes ! Common HP , spend the extra 2 bucks per computer and make those recovery disks for us !  
  Beautiful , unique , stylish and priced right ! Offers good protection for my ipod .  
  If you want a music player which has good sound quality , easy to use and good software interface , then this is the one for you . The display is not as good as an iPod , but the sound quality is really good . The software is better than what iPod has got . It a good deal for $ 185  
  This product works really well . I love the sound and the features are very good .  
  This is my first mp3 and until they change drastically again , it will be my last for awhile . This one covers all my needs and then some . Its small ( palm size ) , light weight , easy to control , works with every downloading service I 've wanted to use and sounds great . If you have basic " I just need some music I can carry easily " type needs like I did , or for a teenager or first mp3 , this is a great purchase . I recommend it highly .  
  I 'm considering returning this camera . Functions are not so bad considering the price . But , battery life is really short . It 's maybe because this camera does not work on the voltage which is a little lower than full . I could use the battery battered from this camera for the other camera .  
  IT WORKS JUST FINE AND DOES WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO DO . I LIKED THE FACT THAT I COLUD TAKE TO THE COUNTER OR TABLE IF I WANTED .  
  It is what they say .. good for the work u want but .. still from 72 to 58 u see the frame of the smaller lens ..  
  How could a company with as much software experience as Microsoft make such a terrible user experience ? The Zune as a device is OK . The Zune experience ( music store , points , ridiculous wi-fi / DRM garbage , etc ) is so , so bad it 's almost unbelievable . Why not just copy Apples model exactly ? Or better yet why not just buy an iPod ?  
  Makes a nice little station , good SNR , and I like how you can plug crap into it . Foo bar baz word count manatee .  
  After recieving this product I worked for 3 days online to get the product to work , I then contacted Garmin Company only to learn that this product is not engineered correctly and will not work on my NUVI 1300 and I ended up buying the proper product from the Garmin website .. This product will not allow your Nuvi to connect to the internet nor will it charge it via the computer .. Very frustrating ..  
  I bought this to connect my cable to my cable modem and DVR box . I am getting excellent speed on my broadband and HD picture on my TV . No hassles . The splitter is heavier than it looks , as some others have commented . But fixes to the wall without any problems , with the pre-inserted screws .  
  Bought this for its vista compatibility . It does not work with Vista despite numerous attemptes . Searching for resolutions to this online reveals hundreds of other frustrated purchasers and not a jot of evidence anyone got it to work . Netgear should be ashamed of themselves for this product and the pitiful support they offer .  
  I 'm really satisfied with this laptop stand . The only con is it 's expensive but totally worth it . The good points are :* solid and good looking product with Mac products * the laptop is really secured ( won't fall ) * the height is ideal for long session workingI will definitely recommend it !  
  Very happy with the product . I can now converse over the internet to my son in Costa Rica at no cost . Great audio quality at a low price  
  I now own 2 of these - one at my house and one at a beach condo . I bought the second one to replace a Belkin router which was continually dropping connections , etc . I knew this router was reliable since I already owned it . The software has been improved since I bought the first one , and makes set-up quick and painless .  
  Excellent design . I prefer this over the Y adapter cables . Feels heavy enough to be solid gold ;)  
  fit perfectly in my truck great price for what you get the middle part cut off very easily to fit my double din  
  these are graet fit and sounds great - wont fall out . PROBLEM : The description on Amazon says 8 ft cord , but is really 4 ft .  
  Got this to combat signal degradation from my antenna attic through splitters to a couple of rooms two stories below . Works well , boosts to maintain the signal through a splitter or two and 100 + feet of cable quality coax . I measured my signal strength pre-boost and post-boost ( on a scale of 0-100 , using a DTV-to-analog converter ) and got a 25 % signal strength boost average across all my channels after the splitters and longest coax run , to bring it * close to * about the same level if I was right at the antenna . Note that I don't think this will make a weak signal strong , but instead will keep a strong signal strong enough across splitters and 100 + lines of cable throughout the house that you will still maintain good signal . It also allowed me to get one channel that I could not otherwise get unless I was only 3 feet of coax away from the attic antenna . Overall a good purchase for the price and works fine , as i 'd hoped and expected - a good option for keeping an digital attic antenna from degrading as it runs through the whole house .  
  Bought the 8840D after reading other owners reviews . Have been very happy with it . We replaced a TRM copier in our store that we had for years . We deal with Brother sewing machines and it was funny to read other reviewers comments about the terrible service issues with Brother support . Same with their sewing machines . But they make a good product !  
  I bought this case back in December 2006 and have used it practically every day since . Its now 2010 and apart from a lot of scratches on the clear plastic screen where the case has been dropped frequently and the metal end of the belt clip falling off its still very usable . I 'm definitely going to purchase another as its been brilliant . I did find that one of the press studs at the back of the stand wore down after a while and initially the buttons were hard to press when the device was inside the case . However considering the amount of daily use and abuse I 've given the case its held up exceptionally well and so far I haven't found anything better to replace it .  
  This camera case is the perfect size for my digital camera . I have a Kodac camera , and it fits great . I also can fit 3 sets of replacement batteries and my spare memory card . It is very durable , i have had it for a couple of years now , with no wear issues . It is a compact size , which I like . To give you an idea of it 's size , it is as tall as your digital camera , and about as twice as wide as your camera 's width . If you are looking for a little durable camera case , this one is for you !  
  I popped in to say that I have had this drive since 2004 , and for two of the past 4.5 years it was abused as my primary media and data drive . She 's still ticking as my always-on OS image and music backup . Funny thing about HDD reviews . People who get burned are more likely to be inspired to write reviews , just as news networks don't sell ads by reporting the good news . Everyone knows that you gamble a bit with mechanical drives no matter the vendor , and we will continue to do so until SSD becomes capacious and cheap enough to overtake their comparably goofy older brothers . Anyway , I 'm just here to tell you that this thing has been abused and is still going strong . Cons ( to be fair ) : It 's large . Appx . 9 " in length . Noisier than others , but quieter than others , too . Though it 's large , it looks * really * good . Very sleek . I gave it four stars not because I deducted one , but because I feel that five stars should be reserved for something that really blows the socks off .  
  I bought these speakers twice , due to excellent reviews for its sound . The first one had a remote that wouldn't control fwd songs on ipod . The 2nd one was dead out of the box . Excellent service from both Vann 's and Newegg who emailed RMA and shipping voucher that paid for shipping back the defective item .  
  .. with the constant advances in technology , however , the latest camera you buy will tend to be the best ever . This is one great camera for the price . i tried the Nikon D50 , Olympus E500 , Pentax * ist , and went for the Rebel XT . They all had features that I liked but the Canon stood above the rest . If you like shooting in available light , Canon is head and shoulders above the competition . The speed of the camera is very impressive as well . I 'm not going to get into all the specs of the camera since they have already been covered . You can't go wrong with the Rebel XT .  
  I was really worried when I saw the bad reviews here before I made the purchase . However , after I purchased and installed one myself , it was not bad at all . I agree that the installation process take a long hour to complete , but I don't find it that difficult or complicated . It will not take you a lot of time to connect every pieces . Most of the setup time will be spent on installing the software . I believe as long as you follow the installation instruction without skipping any step , there should be no problem . The printing quality is excellent , and the software is easy to use . The only one shortfall this printer has is the scanning quality . Color is a bit distored and clarity can be improved . However , if you are looking for a printer with all the basic functions , this is the one for you .  
  My mother recently began using a larger style Kensington computer case of mine which I really LOVE . I quickly realized I needed to get her one of her own . She wanted a bag that wasn't as deep as the one I have , and this bag works just fine ! There is room for her laptop and all the accessories , as well as any paper work and books she may have . Of course there is the standard water bottle pocket , and there are the standard pen / cell / ipod / etc . pockets , but the best feature of this bag is that the padded case for the laptop has handles and pockets for extra items , so it may be removed and easily transported to another location almost like a mini-briefcase . It seems like a silly feature , but makes so much sense ! The wheels on these bags are larger than on other wheeled laptop cases , but it makes all the difference ! The bag is less likely to " have a mind of it 's own " which is important when traveling through places like the airport with your laptop trailing behind . This case is great ! I could go and on , but if you 've come this far into my review , I am sure you 're ready to move on ! This bag / case is definitely worth a try !  
  ilove these speakers , they were way better than i expected . they arrived in a veryquick amount of time . i just bust the speakers on my philips stereo and was so sad about it , cause i had owned it for many years an they played well . i would suggest these speakers to everybody . what a wonderful buy !  
  The Panasonic S52 is great for at home stereo / television use because it is light , convenient and portable enough to fit in a suitcase between trips . The picture quality is excellent and it delivers deep bass and clear treble which means it 's ideal as a cd player too whether it 's hooked up to a stereo or just a tv .  
  I don't have an unusually big head but this headset was so tight it hurt my ears . The main problem with them was seriously muffled sound . I couldn't bear to use them . My Logitech headset is vastly better .  
  I am pleased with my CD player . It was easy to install for the most part . I installed it in my pickup and the little difficulty I had was due to the console and the radio mounting in the dash ; none with the unit itself . The unit works great . I am glad I bought the 12 disc model . John  
  I owned one of the Memorex players and returned it after a week to buy the Expanium and now I love this thing . Before having the Memorex to compare it too - I was hesitant to buy the Expanium but now I see they 've made some intelligent trade offs to get things right . 1 ) You can navigate through a cd w / o looking at the player - the memorex had a complicated procedure that was impossible to use w / o looking at the lcd display . 2 ) Battery life rules3 ) Resume is actually pretty good . I don't even have batteries in mine ( works through car charger ) and I had it unplugged for 8 hours and somehow it still knew were to start the cd ! ( sure it doesn't get the same part of the track , but the same track is close enough ) - they say they have Magic ESP - I think they have Magic Resume ! And a work around to those long tracks in audiobooks - get a program to split it into smaller files . 4 ) ESP that 's great ! I haven't heard the expanium skip yet , and I keep it vertically in a bag that bangs all over the place when I walk ! The Memorex only had ESP on Audio CD 's . It skipped if you looked at it . 5 ) Audiobook usage : I 'm a big audiobook user too , and in my opinion the skip between tracks is better than the Memorex and than most other cd based players - the only time it 's noticeable is when the tracks are split in the middle of a word - but this is actually pretty rare . The only problem is that Old Time Radio would have to be broken into parts by some software before burning the cd . No big deal for me though because I can generally listen to an entire program before I get anywhere decent in my car .. 6 ) Sound quality is great . 7 ) It 's available right here ! ( when in stock )  
  Has worked well in Thailand , Indonesia and China . Have been using the product for 4 weeks without any issues . Hint - make sure the selector switch is in the right position for the correct wattage usage .  
  I use this product everyday in the car , for months now . It works great . There is a little , faint noise from the tape , but I think all tape adapters do that . The cord looks and feels a little flimsy , but it has held up well for several months . Sound quality is very good .  
  Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife so we could discontinue using the other 4 remotes . The TV is an old Zenith , the stero / DVD are 3 + year-old Sonys , and the cable box is a FiOS DVR made by Motorola . All of the devices could be programmed into the Harmony 550 , though not necessarily in a logical manner . The software is regimented and it took several hours of programming and reprogramming before I got it somwhere close to correct . Once done I too found that it has a habit of shutting off the TV when switching tasks . I also found the labels on the buttons to be incredibly small and the LCD is not easily readble . In the end I realized my wife would never get around to figuring out how to make it work for her , so it sits unused , but always illuminated , in the drawer of our coffee table . I say " not surprised " in the title because I have only found one Logitech device in the past 10 years that ever worked close to " as advertised " : a wired gaming mouse . Their products never work for me the way they are described or advertised , so I wind up returning them , tossing them , or trading them to naive " friends " who don't mind a little frustration .  
  I purchased a PowerBook 15 " 1.5Ghz 128VRAM computer around Christmas . I 've built several IBM / PC-based desktop systems , from my first 486DX266 to my most recent 3.04Ghz Dell rebuild ( looks like a Dell , but doesn't quack like one ) . I know what " right " looks like , and Apple has finally gotten it right . The design of the iBook and PowerBook is top-notch . A very tight chassis , maximized screen , and overall clean finish with each model . The software took this Microsoft-handicapped user about an hour to figure out , but if you work with it enough , you 'll find you can learn something new every day . Reliability is also the best I 've ever seen . There are no " blue screens of death " on Mac 's . My wife 's old G3 displayed a " sad Mac " once , but that was on a Mac from another era . I haven't heard of anyone having " show-stopper " problems with the G4 's . I had a few peripherals that I didn't want to part with , like my Dell Axim . Not to worry . PocketMac ( a 3rd-party answer to PocketPC and ActiveSync ) allows me to sync data between PowerBook and PDA effortlessly . The keyboard , mouse , and even monitor can all be used with the PowerBook when I 'm at my desk . Who needs computer speakers when you can play iTunes through your home stereo ( with an Airport Express in the mix ) . When it comes to games , quality headphones do the trick . The 80GB HD is a lot smaller than what I have in my Dell , but I 've invested in a Lacie D2 external drive which puts me at ease when storage is a concern . With Office for Mac , I can open , edit , and save any OfficeXP file I can find . No compatibility issues whatsoever . WARNING : If you intend to play PC games on a Mac by using VirtualPC .. DON'T ! That 's not what VirtualPC was designed for , and the results will show that . If you want to play games on a Mac , visit the Aspyr website and buy the Mac versions . The price was higher than what some would expect to pay for a comparable PC laptop . Extras are expensive , and are probably where Apple really makes their money . Custom configurations are non-refundable / non-returnable , as clearly stated on the Apple website . If you customize ( which you have to , if you want the 128MB video card ) , plan on handing over another $ 300 + for the AppleCare Protection Plan . That 'll give you 3 years service and support - the alternative to being stuck with a lemon six months after purchase - if you 're unfortunate enough . Me ? I guess I got lucky according to one reviewer . Everything worked out of the box , and continues to work as advertised . From what I can tell , that 's not lucky - that 's the norm . As I use the PowerBook more frequently , I find myself going to my Dell less and less .  
  I was waiting until I use this product for a while , it 's been 6 months and now I can write a review for it . This device is like a dream come true . I can't tell how much I love it and how much it helps me everyday . I can keep must of my favourite pictures on the road with me , I can connect it to my car audio without missing any sound , and can do bicycle in the mornings with its headphones ( although the ears begin to hurt after 20 minutes I would recommend buying a better headphones ) , I can copy files from my office and use them at home ( iPod works great as a RAM HD ) . Pros : 1 . Great size and weight for the value2 . The memory is good enough for any mortal , if not please go for the 60 or 80 Gb model3 . The navigation is very easy and you can access anything in a few seconds4 . Personal pictures can be copied at high resolution and watch them anywhere you like , even connected to a TV5 . Music management is cool and FAST . Apple has done a great job here with the iPod and iTunes . I have over 25,000 music files and I cannot imagine use them with any other software . 6 . The HD feature works great . Cons : 1 . It would be better to pay a little bit more for the iPod and get at least the basic accesories such as a good headphones and cables to connect the iPod to the TV . 2 . The calendar and contacts need to be improved . The idea is good but honestly I never use them although I would love to have a more interactive calendar . 3 . The EQ feature sucks . I never use it instead of getting better sound it really makes everything noisy . Apple should consider to disable this one for the next OS version . 4 . The video quality needs to improve as well . The speed of access needs to be a LOT faster . This feature I never use it . This is the best device of its kind . It is not a coincidence the money and popularity that Apple has earned with iPod related products . I don't think that anything in the market can come close to iPod but still iPod lover 's like myselft would thank some improvements like I did mention before .  
  Wrong Item . I 'm having a VERY hard time finding the correct cord . I need the IEE-1284 Compliant Parallel Cable ( with a " C " Connector ) This is for an older HP LaserJet 3100 Back of my Users Guide has Manual Part No . C3948-90968 The back of the printer has C3498A on top and also USBB120614 . If anyone out there can locate this cord , please contact me !  
  This TV , though built a few years ago ( two ) , is an excellent set . It received a top in Consumers ' Report and at that time was pricey . Amazon repriced it on the basis of the present competition , so the price was fair and considering the absence of shipping fees , it was a buy . It is easy to use and the picture is sharp and the color bright . After some fifty purchases from Amazon I commend them on their products and service .  
  Please be carefull , this is not a lie , lot 's of people are having problems whit this memory . " Memory Stick Error " ( C : 13:01 ) on my Sony DSC-W5 ) rises 1 month after I bought this camera , then suddenly It works again , but I 'm expecting to have this problem again . My advice : do not buy it , at least until a new corrected version become available .  
  I purchased this receiver for use in my woodshop , which is in a basement . It is able to tune into radio stations with fairly weak signals as well as clearly driving a CD player , tape deck , and iPod . Programming the radio presets is quick and easy . The remote works for approximately 10 feet . Additionally , the rear of the unit is clearly marked so " set-up " was simple . Thank you Onkyo .  
  This product is exactly what I ordered . This cord was not very expensive but works extremely well . For anyone who needs an ethernet cord I would recommend this product .  
  This thing works great ! Have it mounted in our computer room in the lower level of our walkout ranch and it always works even when ALL DOORS are closed throughout the house . We even take our laptop outside and down to our lake and it works perfectly even at that distance ! Definately a robust and effective wireless router . Buy one , you won't be disappointed !  
  greeting to everybody , i recomment this product . excelent service and delivery .. Enjoy ..  
  This paper has been my only choice for making fine art prints to sell to my customers the past 2 and a half years . Its subtle texture with not too thick but just right thickness plus its ability to produce incredibly rich , accurate colors has been everything I could hope for in a fine art paper . But now .. I 've been told it 's discontinued . What do I do now ? ! I 've tried other papers . They 're not as good . Oh Canon please offer something similar in your product line as a replacement . Perhaps you 're upgrading to something better to come in its place ? I hope so ! I love the Photo Rag paper so much . So I 've searched high and low and bought out any package I can find to help me along for a little while longer until I have to succumb to a different brand . All good things must come to an end , I suppose , but it doesn't change my review any lower than 5 stars because truly this paper is ( was .. * tear *) fantastic .  
  I purchased this card for my Sony VAIO VGN-SZ480 , basically to use it for Windows Vista 's ReadyBoost feature . It works perfect and despite what Microsoft states , I seem to notice a reduction in RAM usage of about 10 % from the mid 40s to the mid 30s with a 2 GHz chip and 2 GB of RAM . Yes VISTA needs lots of speed and lots of memory ( RAM and HDD ) .  
  Had the worse stuttering playback on some dual layer DVDs and likes to stutter when playing PIONEER Anime DVDs for some reason . I thought I got a faulty player returned it for another Fisher S1100 & I encountered the same problems with the replacement unit .  
  I justified my purchase of this gizmo because I needed a voice recorder . It works fine but I found out that you need to press a series of buttons to record . I needed something more convenient . My real desire was to have a small lightweight MP3 player . This accomplishes that in spades . Very easy to use-plug into your USB port and transfer MP3s to it . Plug in your earphones and away you go . 256 megs is about 3-4 hours of music total . I 've never loaded it that much . It has the most amount of memory that I 've seen in a MP3 player this small . This things not much bigger than a flash drive unit . By the time you add space for the extra electronics to play MP3s , battery and a LCD screen , it 's amazing that they could keep it this small . Controls are limited . Basically you have volume and skip forward , backward . There are some equalizer presets to change the sound but no actual bass or treble control . Random would be nice but not available . Also , it doesn't come with an armband-only a cord to hang around your neck . Not too convenient if you are going to exercise or do something that requires a lot of movement . In fact , the small size of this unit caused me to make a mistake . But it also shows that Buslink has good customer service . I was using it when I would do yardwork , etc . Instead of using the neck cord I put it in my pocket . My body movement caused too much pressure on the earphone jack . It caused the connection to become unstable . However , I emailed Buslink with this problem and they sent me a RMA number within 1-2 days . I need to send it back but was able to jury rig it to keep working . I hate to be without it for 3-4 weeks to send it back . In a nutshell , it 's a great little MP3 player , very small , lightweight . Also functions as a voice recorder and flash drive . If you want more storage or more audio features , look elsewhere . But if you want an MP3 player that is practically unnoticeable , get this one .  
  Thank you very much for replacing this because it is noisy indeed yet it does not smell like it is going to burn up soon !  
  The receiver itself is of good quality , and I had no issues with installation scheduling . However , the receiver completely stopped working 5 months after purchase - frozen video , couldn't power off , etc . My local ( authorized ) Hughes repair center had the unit for 30 days before being informed by Hughes that the needed replacement motherboard was ' unavailable ' - with no date available . After a couple of long sessions with Hughes support , I was shipped an ' advance replacement ' unit - which requires you to give a credit card number as security until they receive your broken unit . We 'll see if this one holds up ..  
  I have another San Disk product and it has never failed to operate properly and I expected the same from the 12-1 reader . So far I am extremly pleased with both its operation and its looks . It looks great on my computer table  
  the sony cybershot V3 fits great , it also has some pockets for the memory , the fabric looks very durable  
  Bought it and it did not work right ! Keeps doing a DNS error that never happens with my other router ! This is junk ! Don't Buy !  
  Sony BCG-34HRMD4 ( mind you , it is NOT ' Super Quick ' ) Pro : Sony BCG-34HRMD4 has LCD readout of progress / failure for each oneIMHO , I 'd say that ( unless you are forever in a mad rush ) the LCDscreen ( which indicates each battery 's status ) outweighs AA & AANiMH chargers made by Rayovac or Energizer ( although 15 minutes ) . Con : The two other brands ( which are comparable for results ) charge in15 minutes ( stated claim ; you argue with them , not me ) . These two brands are - Rayovac 15-Minute ( IC3 technology ) ( there 's one w / car adapter ) ( you can get spotty / bad info by doing a Search for B0000A1OFY ) - Energizer 15-Minute chargers and batteries ( Search B0000DIIAS ) ( note well that the Energizer people make / sell three different AAbatteries that are rechargeable NiMH ; they have different limits . Check and double-check ( by walking into the physical store if youhave time and mobility ) the different grades of AA batteries . Youwill see that just because they look alike on the outside and saybasically the same thing ( brand logo , design , color ) , they aren'tall the same . No time to figure out for you the exact strengths Isaw in the store ; suffice it to say that you want the maximum one ( I think the capacity is 2500 mAh ; the 2 others hold less juice ) . From what I saw by reading labels ( super fine print , no pride ) itseems that the AA size NiMH Energizer cells come in only 1 power ( I forget the strength , but it was less than any 1 of the 3 AA 's ) Even though you CAN find and buy a Sony or Energizer battery thatwill charge / work when using Sony / Energizer / Rayovac NiMH chargers , I seriously suggest that you opt for the Rayovac 15-minute cells . They might and probably will cost you more cash up front than theother two brands ( Sony / Energizer ) , but it seems that Rayovac 's 15minute technology has a lot to do with their cells / batteries , andthe other two makes are perhaps more passive . You 'll get adequateinfo about the pros and cons by entering a well-stocked store andwhipping out the magnifying glass to study the fine print . Basicsare NOT spelled out for everyone to see : stuff such as CAPACITY & whether you can charge ' unequally-yoked ' batteries ( varying loadsor brands , for example ) . In case you use Rayovac ( aka Ray-O-Vac ) , beware the high heat that is generated , even when used CORRECTLY . Don't let young people or airheads handle that brand 's 15-minutesline of products ; they 'll mess up ( burn skin or total the house ) . No , the chargers are not as dangerous as old-time pressure cookervalves BUT you should read and follow instructions BEFORE use . Itis not in the best interest of the various manufacturers to focusattention on SAFETY , since they 'd have more trouble selling theirproducts . They DO disclose safety precautions , BUT IN small PRINT  
  I was recording a band in a very small venue that had a keyboard connected to the vocal PA . Normally I would put a splitter on the XLR mic cable , sending the signal to both the in-house PA and my recorder . But the keyboard connected via 1/4 & # 34 ; plug . So , I used this adapter to connect the 1/4 & # 34 ; plug to the XLR splitter . The keyboards sounded fine through the PA and the recording came out clean as well . These adapters are solid , well-made and do the job .  
  Excellent small and flexible camcorder , Picture quality great , sound is Okay , have tried not external mic . so not fair to make real judgement .  
  I have used several of these mice to their breaking point ( in a few years of heavy use each ) . I like the fit and the comfortable-ness ( a word ? ) of this mouse . I also used a Microsoft Trackball Optical for years , until they stopped making them . I was not willing to pay the enormous price the MS ball gets now , so switched back to this mouse , which I had used years ago . It takes minimal getting used to , if you have used the MS or any trackball device before . It is smaller than the MS one , which some like and some don't . It 's only drawback to me is that it is a three button , where the MS one has five ( which I had gotten very used to ) . For the price of [ .. ] tho , its a winner to me , and well worth using before switching back to a " normal " mouse again . Hope this helps you decide ! And no , I have NO affiliation with MS or Logitech , just trying to spread some information on a product I have used for over ten years ..  
  i bought these because i saw some reviews on here and i researched them on the internet i had a party recently ( outside ) and in the middle of the day at like 2 my neighbor called and complained and these things weren't even turned a 1/4 of the way up if you want some speakers that look awesome and sound the same buy these they are well worht the money and you will be pleased you can hear everything the highs mids and the bum the bass i listen to everything from blues to reggae so i mean you can't go wrong take my word for it hope you enjoy  
  Well I decided to check the reviews out on here because I was suddenly having trouble burning data on my Sony CD-R 's . I saw all the negative reviews and was somewhat relieved . I thought I was having a problem with my burner or some bug got in my computer system .. however that wasn't the case . The damn Sony CD-R 's must be defective . I had previously bought a 50-pack spindle of Sony CD-R 's and used all of them up without any problems using the same program that I am currently using now ( Nero ) . Then I bought another 50-pack , didn't have any problems with the first 8-10 but all of a sudden , none of them seem to want to work . Read errors all over the place ! I must have wasted 25 or 30 discs by now . I decided to try some other CD-R 's - Memorex in particular and the CD 's burn as good as new . It looks like all the stores are slashing the prices on this item .. probably because they got a lot of complaints . So thank you to all the reviewers out there who wrote the bad reviews . Very helpful . You may get lucky with these and you may not .. but I wouldn't chance my money on them .. just buy another brand , they 're all basicly the same price .  
  Excellent home fax machine . Doesn't take up a lot of desk space , pretty simple to operate , can send an automatic cover page , etc . Would purchase again .  
  The Peerless SP850 UNLP-GB does everything you want .. up , down , left side , right side and various degrees of tilt . The installation instructions were very easy to follow and performed , all the necessary bolts , nuts and screws were in the package .. idiot proof installation . In addition , the glossy black finish perfectly matched the finish of my new TH-42PZ85U Panasonic 42 " Plasma TV . So needless to say , this is the perfect mount for any large Plasma or LCD  
  The batteries , included , were old , almost expired and had to be replaced . The item didn't work at first ; I didn't expect expired batteries , but when I replaced them it worked fine . And the service was very good ; no problem there .  
  Plugged it in , printed with no problems from my laptop !  
  Super easy setup . Good sound quality . My friends tell me they can finally hear me properly now , so they all got me on mute :\ .. The software ( yes install the software , new version at Microsoft ) is minimal and does a good job of switching primary audio and mic to the headset when plugged in . Really though , for the price this thing is really nice . I don't have huge ears ( at least I think so ) so these sit very comfortably . I had them on for a few hrs the other day and I actually forgot I had them on . Short and simple , they are $ 20 ~ , if you don't have front audio ports or a speaker system with 3.5mm jacks on a desktop remote , then just buy these . They work and sound just as good as the $ 100 ~ ones .  
  I 've had an ipod for 4 years . I have an original 5 gig Ipod and fell in love with it back in 2002 . It still works great and battery life is still good . I was thinking of getting a new 30 gig ipod with video but received the 4 gig nano as a gift . So far I love my nano . The size is just right , the screen is very bright and clear , and battery life is very good . The only thing I don't like is the headphones . I have never liked Ipod headphones but thought the new Nano headphones might change that , they didn't . For me they just don't fit well so sound fades away very easily . They also fall out easily when on a run or walk . I have a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 2 headphones and when you match them up with the nano the sound quality is fantastic . For walks or runs I use a cheap pair of nike headphones that wrap around your ear . I picked up the Nike + integration device and a pair of Nike + shoes to track runs and walks . For the price this is the best addition to your Nano if you like to walk / run with your nano . The shoes are a little expensive but not much higher than most shoes today . The adaptor integrates so easily anyone can use it . It provides a great way to track your workouts . Overall , I love my Nano . For the features , Itunes integration , and many offered accessories for the Ipod , I 'm not sure why anyone would buy anything but an Ipod . Good luck to the Zune , you 'll need it .  
  I replaced a Linksys Wireless G router which was just not getting the job done . My home network is on two different floor levels and at opposite ends of a fairly large house . The D-Link DIR-655 signal is making the trip with no problems . Installation was quick , simple and actually worked the first time . I would highly recommend with the caveat to shop around for the best price available .. got mine from Amazon .  
  After my disastrous experience with the Toshiba 27df46 ( see my review of that product ) , I purchased this set . The picture , sound and all features are superior . I don't watch much TV , but what I do watch is at least enjoyable from a technical perspective thanks to this Sony . I really don't understand the complaints others have posted regarding the sound being too loud on this set , I have not run into that problem at all . The only complaint I have thus far is that it is obvious that HDTV menus are a add-on to this set . If you wish to adjust anything ( other than channel or volume ) while watching Digital TV you have to select the Analog menu then tab over to the Digital menu before you can adjust picture / close captioning etc . The design of the menus for the Digital is modern and high tech in appearance whereas the Analog is very 70 's and cartoonish in appearance . It appears that Sony " went cheap " on this feature and rather than rewriting the entire Menu software they simply tacked on the Digital to the existing . If you watch primarily DVD 's , analog Satellite or Cable this menu issue is less likely to be an annoyance . I use the Digital menus a lot simply because I frequently watch over-the-air HD broadcasts .  
  It works as describes . It cleans up your AC power for a better picture , and provides surge protection . I notice a difference instantly , and my stereo performes better as well . Bass and trebble response is enhanced as described in the description .  
  I can't say enough about Creative 's MP3 players ! No , they don't pay me , but darn it , they should , as much as I tell people how great they are ! The battery life dwarfs iPods and the software - way better for keep track of your music . Ever asked someone for a copy of a song they have , from iTunes ? Ya , good luck with that . I 've given these as gifts because they 're so easy to use and work so well ! I don't travel anywhere without mine !  
  Iogear GWF001 Wireless WiFi HotSpots Explorer works as advertised . Great little product , I bought two of them . dw USA :-)  
  I bought my first pair of these Sennheiser headphones so that I could watch HiDef / DVD in bed while my wife went to sleep . It 's not my first experience with wireless , but the best to date . Good enough that I 've ordered a second pair for use in another room . And it 's actually my third set because the first pair I bought was a gift for someone who allowed me to try them out for a few days . That was enough to convince me . I 've previously used other Sennheiser professional gear . In some cases in the past I found the sound satisfying but the ergonomics less so , i.e. an earlier set of noise suppressors worked wonderfully but were awkward to carry on a plane . And I 've tried a variety of other wireless headphones of assorted major brands . These are the best to date . No they don't quite measure up to wired very high end headsets , but they 're pretty darned good . Signal carries from one room of a largish house to another with very few artifacts , also much superior to other wireless phones tried . I can't explain people who cite almost immediate failure . They are well made .  
  Hi there , I bought this surround sound system a couples days ago . I thought that I was going to be dissapointed , but I was amazed by the power and fidelity of this system instead . It has 3 digital inputs ( 2 optical , 1 coaxial ) , 1 analog input ( that you can convert into 4 with a pair of splitters ) , 1 USB for future upgrades , and a slotcard . The speakers are amazing . You can expect a quality sound from these omnisat satellite speakers ( RCA connectors instead of convention cable is not too much problem just buy better cables ) . The subwoofer sounds deep and you can place it in any room location ( I put it next to my T.V. ) . Well I hope that you guys buy this system it really rocks !  
  Tried to use this in garage computer with no luck . very weak and slow . Maybe use this in the same room ..  
  Affordability is the key . With the increased focus on more memory storage ( 30GB or even 80GB ) , this is not the product . If you want to purchase an item that provides music and entertainment while exercising on a treadmill or doing work around the house , then look no further . This SanDisk product is under $ 30 and provides up to 19 hours of play with the use of just " 1 AA " battery . Its compact design allows you to hold the player in your pocket or with an armband . Easy to transfer music files also .. just drag and drop once you attach the SanDisk to your computer with a USB cable . My only regret is I could have purchased a 1MB for only $ 8 more .  
  This little power strip was great on our recent trip to Ireland . We brought this with a little plug adapter and it all worked perfectly . It turned out , though , that I only used it once ; I guess I didn't need to charge things as often as I thought I would . However , I am taking it with me to New York this month . It 's small and compact ( I love how the cord wraps around the strip ) , so it won't take up much space in my luggage .  
  Photograph shows 1 spindle pack of 50 disks . That 's not what you get . You will receive 1 single disk . Mine arrived damaged .  
  Want to keep your USB handy and dust / lint free ? Well , you need this product . IT holds two USB Drive 's and clips to your keyring , lanyard , backpack , purse , etc .  
  I 've bought Microsoft ergonomic keyboards for years . My previous one lasted two years before keys mysteriously died - not great longevity , but acceptable . But my newest one has become useless in just over 5 months . Today multiple keys on the right side just died on me , seemingly out of nowhere . Reading these other reviews , I guess they have a quality control problem with this board now ; buyer beware .  
  This Andis 30970 , was a wonderful purchase . Good size , good heat temperature , easy to install and the cord hanger goes on either the right or left side . I have had other wall mounted dryers , they were hard to hang , the Andis was up in a matter of minutes .  
  I like the handle and this puppy doesn't skip . I tend to treat my players like my boys would treat their things-roughly . And it has held up . I did have to take the first one I received back to the store as it was a lemon but the second one was fine . It has a warranty . I have a bit of trouble getting it to change from one song to another but otherwise this one is the best that I have found . And like I said it takes the licks and doesn't skip .  
  Excellent product . This is an upgrade for me from an older 256MB iRiver MP3 player . I use it while excercising at the gym three times a week and enjoy if very much .  
  I have never had a product from Sony that wasn't wonderful until this . I have fully charged both sets of batteries numerous times and they won't hold a charge . Every time I go to use my Sony digital camera the batteries are dead . So I try the extra set and they are also dead . I charge them again , install them in the camera and store it for later use . I 've repeated this 5 or 6 times since July 1st and I give up .  
  I bought this player for my sister and she loves it . The reason I purchased SANDISK was I know the brand is quality . I have purchase a few SD cards and a card reader from SANDISK and I have never had a problem with them . Another reason I puchase the SANDISK player was due to the low price . The price was 1/2 as cheap as similar products . SANDISK makes their own flash so they can charge much less to consumers .  
  What a great little alarm clock . Very feature rich . Would recommend . Might be a little difficult understand at first .  
  This thing does the job . I was having neck pains , so I went ergonomic on all my laptop needs . I am tall , so I needed one that is adjustable , and this one is great . The one complaint I have is that my laptop is a toshiba , therefore the volume adjustment , headphone / mic input and SD card input are all in the front , which is blocked by the rubber grip . I deal with it by adjusting the volume digitally now , but it would be nice if I had a different type of laptop .  
  The Panasonic Shockwave player is a great player . It is well constructed , takes a beating and has a really good sound . This is not only a great looking player ; but a great all around portable .  
  I didn't buy this from amazon , you can get this at WALMART for $ 15 , it should be in the CD / DVD section or the movie section . It 's sturdy , might work better on carpet floors , cause it could be slippery on hard wood floors . but overall great for putting DVD 's on ~ this is perfect for someone who just wants to put DVD 's on the shelves for a decent price . NOT for ppl who are looking for the greatest shelf in the world , for $ 17 or $ 15 dollars this is what you 'll get .  
  I have 5 of these trackmen : 3 at home ( each one attached to a laptop or workstation : my wife and kids love it equally ) , 1 in the office , and one spare part . Wherever I work on a computer at a desk , one is always with me . Sure , I had to get used to it in a matter of a couple hours . But after that , I simply never would go back . It needs no more space than an adult man 's hand , is super-easy to clean , and my first trackman is over 10 years old now & mdash ; it never let me down even once during all this time ! I simply cannot believe they do no longer produce them . I prefer the USB-cord-version because it does not need batteries , but eventually I have to get a cordless one , because the cord-versions are increasingly difficult to find . What a pity !  
  I use this both in my ford truck tape deck and mid 90s RCA boomboox . Initially one of the gears had a small piece of plastic attached to it which prevented it from turning freely . After removing the screws on the back of the adapter and shaving the defective gear with a knife the gears rotated smoothly . During the repair period I did discover that using the pause button on the tape deck allowed the adapter to still play even with out the heads spinning which is also helpful on older tape decks where the spinning mechanism might be broken or dirty . Since the initial repair the adapter has worked perfectly for connecting my I phone 3S to both audio systems . The flexability of being able to secure the cord to either side of the tape adapter is a huge plus allowing the wire to be less cumbersome when inserting it in different directions . The mini plug has a nice click and secure fit into the iphone and the clarity seems perfect .  
  1 . ) Use too many ink to clean head . Cited from $U$ do the color ink cartridges run out of ink even though I never or rarely print in color ? DESCRIPTION : One factor that will affect your color ink consumption is the cleaning cycles of the machine . The machine is designed to automatically flush and clean ALL of the ink jet nozzles on a programmed schedule . A periodical cleaning or " flushing " of all the ink cartridges occurs approximately every two days . During the cleaning process , the machine draws out a small amount of ink to remove air bubbles from the cartridge and to remove dust and dried ink from the ink nozzles and channels . This not only ensures premium print quality but also ensures the life of the print head . Because of the ink jet technology , this process is common to all ink jet machines . 2 . ) If any one ink cartridge empty ( there are four cartridges here , one black and three color ) , you cannot print anything , even fax . E. g . you run out of yellow ink , you cannot print black / white fax . This is not the case when I with my other inkjet printer . This is designed feature for printing quality . You can find something in brothe 's web site . So this is a cheap machine . I got it from Staple for $ 70 . If you do a lot color / black printing . Then this is the one for you . Photos printed are not too bad as this cheap printer . Another , do buy " One-Year Replacement Plan " You will need to replace this within one year !  
  I ordered this hair dryer after trying it at a hotel . I immediately noticed a difference in my hair not being as frizzie or " fly away . " I had no idea that an ionic , ceramic hair dryer could make that much difference ! It 's a pretty large and heavy dryer , so I really like the retractable cord and the folding handle for travel and storage .  
  The replacement RF-3 Body Cap worked and fitted my Canon 60D camera perfectly . In my opinion , it works even better than the original one . It also arrived on time as scheduled .  
  Was glad to be able to find a typewriter correction ribbon . I know a typewriter is an archaic machine but it does come in handy when customers send a pdf , instead of a doc or excel form , to be filled in .  
  I purchased this photo printer back in August for a family Christmas present as was a great price . Perhaps I should have but didn't open it until after my son unwrapped it . To my surprise , the printer head and ink containers were already unwrapped and installed ! There was a couple 5x7 blank glossy printer sheets in that section so we decided to try it . No matter where you adjust for the picture to come out , it is not centered . Almost half of the picture is cut off . And , the colors are streaked in part of it and not anything like in the picture . I thought perhaps it was because the ink containers had started to dry up or something but that would only be if they were unwrapped and unused for well over a year . My understanding when I ordered this is that it was brand new . However , it looks to me like someone else bought it , put it together , got the same unsuccessful results and returned it . I also have no way of contacting the place I purchased this from to complain and try to get a refund as I have no paperwork . I am very , very dissatsified with this purchase and will certainly in the future , always open up a package and check on it even if it is going to be given as a present a few months in the future . The only reason I have one star is because there wasn't anything lower .  
  I purchased a Cobra radar detector , the 3 times it went off i was aprox 1 block from the cop , the reason i purchased this model was it was said to have a 2 to 3 mile range , NOTSo i called the Cobra manufact . and they told me to return it to them , cost of shipping UPS was $ 15.00It has not been returned yet , but it was new and in sealed box , but not what i expected . Had I bought it from Radio Shack or Best Buy i could have returned it for another one  
  The bad points first : Auto-focusing can be slow ( too slow for close-up graduation photos ) ; cannot imprint date / time on a picutre ( although info is stored with file when transferred to computer ) ; batteries last only about 200 shots at max resolution ; no manual focusing for tricky situations ; cannot mount protective filter without blocking some light ( vignetting ) . Otherwise , a really great camera . Even 8x11 prints are good enough ( the Leica lens really shines ) . We also have a smaller 4-meg SONY , but much prefer this 2-meg Panasonic for versatility . Especially great for paintings in museum that allow photos without flash-the reproductions of masterpieces are really impressive . The zoom is awesome . Grainy at 36x but give some prints a artsy look . Takes better flash photos ( not over-exposed ) than both the SONY 3-meg and 4-meg that we have . With a 256MB SD card .. can take about 25 minutes of Apple Quicktime movie ( cannot zoom while shooting ) or 300 pictures at max resolution . Cheap when bought online ..  
  Nikon quality at an exceptional price . Allowed me to take photos this past weekend from angles and distances that I could not have had the shot with a shorter lens . The lens is somewhat heavy , yet I was still able to handhold with minimal camera shake .  
  Worked well for my kids who abuse the key board . No issues . My iMac is dead so the keyboard is no longer in use .  
  I bought this about 2 years ago and it still works like new , despite being dropped several times and having an entire cup of coffee spilled on it . If you leave your computer on all the time then the batteries won't last long . Either turn off your computer or take the batteries out when you aren't going to be using it a few hours or more .  
  Product does exactly what I need and the price works very well for me ! Will keep on buying these for as long as I need to ..  
  I 've been running the V995 for about two years now , and it is still going strong . This was my first radar detector , so I don't have anything else to compare it to , but I have been pleased with its performance . Unlike some of my friend 's cheaper radar detectors , the V995 is pretty diligent about not picking up total false positives ( it 's not going off while driving out in the middle of nowhere like my buddy 's does ) . The range on the V995 is very good . In highway driving conditions , I 've had the V995 pick up radar hits easily several miles in advance . In city driving , it 's picked up radar hits in time for me to take corrective action on multiple occasions . Regarding false-positives ; yes , in city driving , there are some stores that will constantly and consistently set this thing off . If I had the money , I 'd buy a higher end radar detector with a built-in GPS that can permanently tune these frequencies and locations out . As it is , I 've learned to just accept and ignore these false-positives . The auto-mute feature is very handy to have in these cases . The only other time I 've gotten false positives is when the sun is very low in the horizon and I 'm driving directly into the sun . That has set up a laser warning a few times . I 'm not aware of any law enforcement actually running laser in this area , so I could probably turn it off all together , but it 's a pretty rare occurrence and I can live with it . For the money , the V995 provides very good performance , and has proven to be very reliable . I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this unit to anyone looking for a reasonably priced high performance radar detector .  
  The devise was very easy to set up and configure on all computers in the network . Mapping the drives after configuration was simple also .  
  With no experience with fish finders I cannot get very technical , but unit seems to function as described . Display is big enough to view and back light is nice . The only issue is the connector . I did read about a " large " connector in other reviews , but it is about an 1-1/2 " - 2 " in diameter , much bigger than I would have ever guessed . If you are transom mounting this unit it would take a VERY large hole to neatly route the cable , and the instructions tell you that warranty is voided if cable is cut . In the end I routed the cable over the top , it looks OK I guess . Just beware of this issue , other than that nice purchase for the money .  
  I purchased these headphones based on the reviews and mine are just horrible . I can't get the signal dialed in at all .. and when I do it has these high pitched screeches that get blasted into my ear . People stated that they ran on the treadmill with these things on ? Yeah , right . There 's no way you could ever do that , let alone just sit on the couch , 8 feet away , like I wanted to do . Sometimes I get it dialed in just right and then I turn my head an inch and blam , a high pitched screech is blasted into my ear . I should have bought them from some place where I could return them . All I wanted to do was keep the wife happy . Do yourself a favor and buy a different product . * update 12/11/12 . After a few years of living in the city we moved to the suburbs . I pulled the headphones out of the garage last week and figured to give them a shot . Well , they still don't work fantastic but I do think the less crowded area has helped with the reception . My old condo was a high rise in downtown Chicago . I don't think that should really be an acceptable excuse since the base unit is 8 or so feet away in direct sight line . - But they are usable now . Would I ever recommend them to a friend ? No , no way . Keep your money . ( Honestly I 'm surprised the wife hasn't thrown them away by now . ) hopefully I can get a little use out of them .  
  I 've found the headphones to produce a good quality sound , fit snugly over your ears and the microphone boom picks up sound fairly good . My ONLY word of caution is that you make sure you have your headphone port close to your microphone port , which is fairly comon amoung newer computers .  
  I don't care what you buy - Mac or PC , but when it comes to a laptop , rule # 1 is get the extended warranty . A desktop PC doesn't matter as much since you open up , take it out of the box and it just sits there . A laptop on the other hand , you take it out and then move it around all the time . It can wear out the system that much faster . If you 're on the fence if you need the extended warranty for the Apple computer - I 'd highly recommend it .  
  I haven't used many of the features of this yet ; took me a month to get the courage to hook it up with the other equipment ! It does record , remote seems pretty straightforward ; much of the difficulty stems from my being non-electronically-inclined , I think . Great deal for the $ !  
  the printer 's quarity is great . It spent less ink and print good photos ( even better than some of the photo printers ) . But it 's a little bit noisy .  
  I had a Kensington that also detected Bluetooth and had a built-in LED light ( dim , but usable under / behind a desk ) . This unit is ok , but I miss the Bluetooth detector .  
  I bought mine as a private label from Dish Network . It developed a hum through the speakers in about 2 months after purchase . I had to fight with Dish for repairs . First trip , wrong part . Service tech re assembled with old part , then no sound . 2 months later another service with " right " part . Board was installed , no sound . Reinstalled old board , no sound . Tompson customer service was awfull , they told me to file a complaint against them . Finally got them to take the set back , and replace with another . It was a low price , and worth every penny of it . Buyer beware , don't get this set !  
  I think this printer offers good value , esp given that it uses six inks ; many printers in this price range only have 3-4 inks . I guess because it is not very compact . I got this for my parents who are not very computer savvy , to let them print their own pictures . I use a website to upload pictures to print ( which I think is still the best value ) , but I just cannot see them doing that . The printer is great because it doesn't even have to be connected to the computer ( another potential problem for them ) . Using the memory card slot is faster than the pictbridge connection . Now they print pictures on their own , instead of the pictures being in their camera for eons . Thank you to all the previous reviewers who helped me choose to buy this printer . I liked the point about being able to replace individual ink colors separately . I am very happy with my decision .  
  I have mine in my car , and for the most part it plays songs quite nicely , I 've found though , that some times it gets up to 11 seconds or so and then stops playing . I 'm not sure if it 's due to bumps in the road , or poor CD quality ( I 've only tried CD-RWs ) . The lack of ID3 support and back light is a bit irritating as well . However few other players could allow me to cary my entire collection of CDs ( well over 6GB ) for as low a price as this does . My next player will likely be a jukebox type , but for now I 'm not unhappy ..  
  I have used this printer now for two years and I just had to come onto Amazon to let people know how happy I am with the printer . I am very happy with this printer and think it is a great value . I also think it is fast at printing pages especially for such a small , economical printer .  
  Unlike what some people are complaining about , I got the item that was pictured . It also works as advertised for my LG Cosmos . There 's only one problem I have with this adapter : the connection is finicky . Sometimes if I twist the plug on my phones jack , I can hear the sound go rather quiet . So , either the jack on my phone is bad or the wiring in the adapter isn't the greatest . Regardless , it was only a little over a dollar and still works pretty well so I 'm not really complaining .  
  I bought this TV about a month ago and I love it ! Using an HD cable box along with a surround sound system it 's very much like having a theater in your livingroom ! I definitely recommend this TV , only down side is not being able to hang it on the wall , but it 's not very deep and a lot lighter than you would think ! ( This 46 " DLP is MUCH lighter than the 42 " Plasma that I had ! )  
  Am very pleased with the Garmin . It was a replacement for one I didn't particularly like ( not a Garmin ) . Got me out of some funny places on a recent trip . I 'm a person who doesn't get lost usually , but followed signs and did . I know there are units with bigger screens and maybe more options , but this one is terrific . The shape is kind of funny . Most are flat backed , but this one will ( sometimes - not in my personal car ) sit in the console . Haven't activated the MSN yet so don't know how well it will work in our traffic . All in all , this is a great piece of equipment , and I 'm glad I picked it to replace the one I had  
  Easy to install ( replaced 5 port SMC model in small business office ) and maintain . A great gigabit ethernet solution for extending network size .  
  Works out of the box , and the included software has a lot of useful utilities for picture taking and making video clips . Works nicely with Skype as billed , and I got this one for an excellent price ( around $ 22 ) . It could work better under low light conditions , but at this price I can't expect miracles . Other more expensive models I tried didn't perform much better in low lighting . Not a biggie for me . Also , would be nice if it worked under linux too , didn't get recognized under Cheese , but it does what I intended it to , is nicely styled , and fully functional for what I purposed it for . Delivery was also quick , so no complaints there either . Nice product , great price , and quick shipping . Quite pleased .  
  just what I needed , it works fine in my GPS . it works in the car in the GPS and transfer data fast enough  
  A simple hub that gets the job done . Works on Macs just fine . I would have liked the chord to have been longer than an inch and a half though .  
  This card reader requires a 30MB TransferMate application to access the individual slots . Why can't this USB hub run in Plug-And-Play mode ? I got this card reader to work once , then I unplugged it and tucked it away until I needed it again . When I went to plug it in later , I was told the driver failed to load because Windows was unable to locate the software for it . That is bad ! My PC is a DELL D820 laptop ( WinXP Pro , 1GB RAM , 100GB HDD ) that I use for work as a software developer , and being a software developer , I feel pretty knowledgable with computers . This device should not be that hard to use ! I 've tried uninstalling everything , rebooting my PC , then reinstalling the software , but I can't get it to run the card reader any more . It looks pretty , but I recommend you find something simpler .  
  Bought this router to replace a DI-524 that had a broken antenna . Verified the firmware shipped with the unit was the latest , and was able to connect to the internet on the wired pc , but the wireless pc had poor / no connectivity . Tried a different channel , and that improved the signal strength , but still less then the DI-524 . Tried to use email , ( Outlook Express on Comcast ) , and received errors that indicated an MTU sizing problem . Tried , unsuccessfully , to change the MTU on the router , so made the mistake of calling DLINK support . After 2 hours on the phone , was informed that I needed to contact Comcast to find out why their modem won't talk to Dlink 's router . Heck with it .. I put a piece of wire on the DI-524 to replace the antenna , and returned the DI-624M.Don't buy this router ! UPDATE 1/20/2007 - Didn't return it , because the vendor won't RMA it .. NO RESPONSE FROM VENDOR . I 'm out the $ 45.00 ..  
  This FM antenna did not work in my situation . Probably too much electrical wiring in the placement area . Cheap dipole single wire antenna works at least as good . Seller did accept return and refunded in full .  
  best tv i have ever owned crisp , clear , colorfol . better then plasma . i saved 2500 dollars [ plasma 3600 dollars ]  
  I cant speak to the old model . The model I have is the newer one apparently . I dont jog or ski with it on . SKI ? Anyway if you are a jogger perhaps you should get one of the small cheaper ones made just for sports use . This is more of a big one for holding TONS of music and transporting / listening to it say from home to work and in the car inbetween . It seems sturdy , good software , nice features good price compared to the Ipod which is 100 more right now . I havnt had it long enough to say if it will last but I will come back and edit this if I have problems .  
  I haven't recieved this item yet since I ordered it on thursday , but I paid $ 37.99 for it on 6/15/06 and now sunday 6/18/06 it is going for $ 46.99 . I am glad I got it when I did . Not paying shipping and tax was also great . Okay I recieved the player on 06/19.2006 . So it only took 4 days for me to get . The player is great . The sound quality and loudness is perfect for me . I am able to download songs very easy ( i use limeware ) . It is very simple to use . If I could do it over agin I would probably get the 1 gig player . I predict that I am going to fill up this thing pretty quickly . Expect to be able to load about 100 songs on to this player . Very good buy . it is so light that you might forget yuou are even carrying it .  
  Works fine , very basic and not very thick cable , but for ~ $ 5 it 's more than adequate . Also , the lock only has one place to insert and remove the key , this is fine ! When you insert the key , it is in the locked position , you turn the key to unlock , then insert into the device you are securing , then turn the key back to relock and remove the key .  
  Works with my Nintendo Wii and homebrew software . No issues . No need for faster Class4 + cards . Very good price too .  
  I just received my headphones . They came before I expected and what I received was what I saw online . The headphones are of very good quality , and now I can finally have good quality audio after using the one dollar store headphones ! [ .. ]  
  I am in no way a photographer .. I do take pictures though . I bought this to replace my older HP digital camera that broke . This is the perfect camera for a novice to take TOP QUALITY photos . I am a midwest storm chaser and I love the no flash option of this camera ( when there is little light ) with dim daylight caused by heavy cloud cover . It is really great for portraits as well . I bought mine through another site and received 4GB card , card reader and charger . As others have said , it works much better with the rechargable batteries for multiple shots . Some have mentioned " cons " , but for me , there is no downside .  
  This is actually a pretty nice unit . My only gripe is that if you have a power outage , someone needs to manually push the on / off button to turn it back on . Not very well though out on the part of Linksys . Otherwise , it provides far more functionality than it claims including acting beautifully as a webserver .  
  So far this is one great printer . All the pictures that I have copied look like a professional has done them . The printer does what they claim and prints very clear and sharp . I like this printer alot .  
  I 'm not a photographer . I just wanted a camera to capture cool things out in the world . After doing a little research ( and feeling lost in features ) , I picked this camera . I 've been experimenting with it and I have to say that I 'm quite pleased with it ! ( On an environmental note , its nice that it comes packaged with a cardboard insert inside the box as opposed to styrafoam . ) I like the fact that it runs on AA batteries . As others have noted , it does tend to suck batteries , so rechargeables help . It comes with more features than I 'm ever going to use , but just to put it in basic operation , snap some pictures , and put them on the computer turned out to be surprisingly easy . So far , the quality of the images have been excellent . The only complaint I have ( and it is a very minor one ) is the design of the battery door seems very odd . Every time I change the batteries , I 'm afraid I 'm going to break it . Thus far , this hasn't happened , but I still hold my breath . Overall , I think this is a handy and capable digital camera at a really good price .  
  This product works extremely well ! I am very happy with it . Which surprised me because I have had some bad experiences with the SIIG brand before ? I was initially very nervous about ever purchasing a SIIG whatever . I spent half the money on another one with a cheap VIA chipset , and had nothing but problems . I guess you get what you pay for . My computer : An ASUS P4TE motherboard with a 1 gig of RAMBUS RAM ( uses an Intel 850 chipset - RAM alone costs $ 500 ) , a Silicon RAID card , an ASUS NVIDIA chipset graphics card , an Intel Gig Ethernet card , a SoundBlaster Audigy 2 audio card , another SoundBlaster PCI audio card , and a few optional extras that I also installed . I know my computer is choosey when it comes to chipsets ; if yours is too , go with this card . It uses an NEC chipset , auto detected by Windows XP Pro , and it just works flawlessly . I wish I hadn't wasted my money on the other one . One neat thing about this card , it has a power port for a floppy drive connector that gives the card more power then my motherboard can supply it through its PCI slot . I mean after all , the card does have four external USB ports , and one internal one . The internal one also allows you to hook up via a header pin configuration , but not both at the same time . If there was anything I wish this card had was an extra internal USB port . For some strange reason my motherboard , as good as it is , never came with a USB 2.0 chipset on it . Go figure !  
  I can't believe how easy this camera is to operate . I received the camcorder last night and was anxious to get some test footage of my daughter before she went to bed . To save time , I skipped reading the directions and went straight to fiddling with the camera . With absolutely no difficulty or direction I was able to snap on the battery pack , plug the camera to AC power , pop in a disc , and begin recording my daughter 's silly bed time antics . Now it was time to play it in the DVD player . A freind had told me that you need to " finalize " the disc before you can play it in a DVD player . So , after a moment of hunting in the setup menu I found and selected the " finalize " option . A little whirring and a grave warning not to vibrate the camera , and a few minutes later the disc was done . I placed the disc in the DVD player still believing this was too good to be true , but there it was . My daughter giggling and singing in 16:9 aspect ratio on my big TV , with no wires and no need to boot up my computer . Within 30 minutes of pulling the camera out of the box I was playing a freshly recorded movie without having to glance at the manual . I can't say enough about the ease of use . And , the quality is top notch . I 'm no expert but I have an older Sony Mini-DV and I 've been exposed to home movies made on a number of different cameras . The picture quality on this one is as good or better than any video camera I 've ever seen . But it was the sound quality that shocked me . As I sat watching my daughter sing on camera I heard her singing in front of me . Then , I was startled to hear the sounds of my wife and I laughing and coaxing her comming from the surround speakers behind me . That 's right , this thing records in Dolby 5.1 surround sound ! So far , I 've only recorded two discs worth of material , and I haven't even gotten into exploring the more advanced features of the camera , but it does everything I want it to do . Incredible ease of use . High quality digital picture and sound . The only drawback I see is the $ 5-$8 price tag per blank disc . But as one reviewer mentioned you can transfer your movie to a much cheaper full size CD-R using a DVD recorder or your computer . Then you can reuse the same $ 8 mini disc over and over again . Either way , it 's a small price to pay for such a convenient and high quality product .  
  i bought this for my powerbook because it had two stupid usb ports . i have a mouse in one & this hub in the other . the hub has my printer , external harddrive , & camera cord . i have never had any problems with lack of power . i enjoy this hub .  
  The item was just as ordered . The only problem was that it was delivered in a wide open box , but this was done in shipping .  
  Comfortable headsets and mic . Good sound quality , easy to install on PC and good value . Prompt shipment , besides .  
  I had these for little over a year now and they have the perfect sound and very comfortable ! The one thing is that after about a year , the cable at the end wore off ! Mind you I used then everyday and in the gym all the time ! I will buy another one cos they are absolutely worth it !  
  is all what you excpect from Sony ! excellent quality , no problems at any aspect . 100 % recommended ! in special if you will use those for your computer !  
  At work part of my job is to create designs for applications and web pages . I developed tendonitis in both wrists and using a regular mouse became quite painful . It didn't matter that I kept swapping hands . A co-worker suggested one of these tablets and it 's been a few years now and no symptoms . It is so much better ergonomically for your hand and arm than any other mouse I tried . In fact when I bought a new laptop for home , I ordered this new version of the tablet . It 's even better because it has the scroll bar . Try it , give yourself a little time to adjust to the new way of " mousing " and you will never go back to anything else .  
  This camera , while small and easy to bring along anywhere , takes very blurry pictures at least half of the time . I 've been disappointed so many times , thinking that I have some really cute pictures , only to find once I download them that they are blurry . I have to say I am very disappointed . If there is even the slightest movement , the picture is blurry . I have contacted Sony and plan on returning the camera to see if there is something they can do to fix it since it is still under warranty . Buy a different camera - especially if you have young children , as I do , and pictures are too precious to waste .  
  Pros : I love the little thing . I love it 's fast load times , the sound quality , the whopping * huge * capacity . I regret * nothing * . It 's great . My non-Mac contacts are jealous - though I just read an article saying that a product is in the works that would allow non-Macs to use an iPod as well . Ehh . Cons : But I wish the wee bugger came with a case . Just a case . You know , for working out and stuff . Otherwise , it 's just great . I might like to peruse by genre , but I can make another playlist and it works as well . Also , the view is slightly grainy , and I 'd prefer something a bit easier on the eyes - as long as I 'm asking , in blue : it stands out well in most lighting situations .  
  Product delivered promptly and as advertised .  
  Bought this LF30STerk Technologies Leapfrog LF-30S Wireless 2.4 GHz A / V Distribution Systemto install a TV at the kitchen . All very easy to install , but the quality of the signal is poor , despite the receiver is installed only 22ft far from the transmitter , with no brick walls between them . I tried all channels , relative positions of antennas , and with and without wireless phone and internet router functioning . Nothing improved the quality of the image , full of " ghosts " . Better to try an internal antenna if you want to watch only local channels . This device is not even close to what it says in its description .  
  We used this camcorder about 3 times before it died . It would no longer record properly . It captured audio but not video ( ended up with a blank screen video capture . ) The problem lies with a buggy CCD block assembly . The same problem can be seen with similar Sony camcorder models . These camcorders tend to develop the blank screen issue anywhere from 6 months to 2 years after purchase . There are reports all over the internet about this problem but Sony denies that it 's a manufacturing issue and wanted 200 + to repair . I wouldn't get this camcorder ( or any other Sony camcorder ) again .  
  Just recently purchased this camera to replace my old Canon 35mm SLR which had been sitting in storage for a couple of years since I bought my first digital . Already having Canon USM lenses I got the body only and am very impressed with the results so far . I can honestly say that the only photos that haven't come out the way I wanted them to were purely my fault . Gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons . 1 . I am used to changing the focus from Single to Servo using a dial . Since I change this setting a lot I do not really like having to push buttons to do this . 2 . They have made this camera a lot smaller than the ' traditional ' Canon SLR . Mostly in the width .. I did prefer the larger body size personally . 3 . Having to push buttons to change the focus point really does annoy your subjects for portrait shots . ( It takes some time ) I know I should have bought another camera with Eye focusing if this was an issue for me , but it is just what you get used to I suppose .  
  These headphones are very comfortable and offer good sound Quality . They are a bit Pricey , but they 're worth it . I would recommend these to a friend .  
  Had problems receiving local TV stations with the conventional roof top antenna with a long run of antenna wire attached to a regular tv set . Couldn't get some stations & others were poor quality except for one or 2 . This signal booster along with a previously purchased interior antenna greatly improved picture quality and now I receive stations I never could before . Good product . easy to install .  
  Had this baby for a month . It has pleased my wife and myself well . We can receive more than a dozen of Digital TV off air with vivd high quality pictures . Had thoughts about 1080p DLP from Toshiba or Mitsubichi , but settled with this one due to the concerns of lamp life , style , technology maturity and the video source of 1080p . Plasma is expensive , power hungry and limited with screen size . Panel LCD ones are even more expensive comparing its available size . The aging effect of the above two can not be reverted due to the non-replaceable parts . However , this LCD projection TV can have the same sharp / brightness again once the aging bulb is replaced . This is a better choice if you like bigger screen and are not limited by the space in the rear . The HD program from KQED and others are very impressive with this 720p one . There is hardly any visible detail deference from the 1080p that I can observe . The screen door effect is visible at close up , but we don't watch TV that way . So it is not an issue . There were a lot of lamp problems with projection TVs . This one seems OK from the rating I can find . It also has a 18-month replacemnet warranty . This is a good confidence and peace of mind . There are areas for improvement : 1 ) the volume is too low , I almost need to turn up fully for some channels . 2 ) fan noise is OK usually but needs be lower for a quite night . 3 ) Two RF inputs for both Cable and Antenna . In all , it is a nice one and we enjoy it very much so far . The shipment is fast except that the shipment status shown it was delivered to Florida instead of California on the website ! I was nervous at that time . PS - Please note this review is based on the price of $ 1500 I paid for it . I didn't realize its price has been changed ! Hope this won't confuse you .  
  We ordered these speakers to use with [ .. ] . When they arrived , one of the power supply cords for one speaker was faulty . My husband wrote the company to request another cord , but the request was totally IGNORED ! He finally found something around the house that would work so we could plug it in . We love the speakers , but don't understand ANY company these days that would totally ignore their customers .. without the customers , your company WOULD NOT EXIST ! I would have rated this company 5 stars , if not for their Customer Service ( or lack thereof ! ) I JUST learned that after a month , we have FINALLY received an e-mail this week saying they are sending another cord . Too bad they couldn't have responded within a reasonable amount of time .. !  
  I personally am not one to go for pink either but , I went ahead and took the chance because they were on sale . I 'm glad i bought them now because they are amazing . They are worth the price thats for sure , I wouldn't trade them for any other headphones !  
  This deepview eyepiece I have gotten alot of enjoyment out of , the wide field of view it provides and 2 " diameter make it seem like you 're looking through a much bigger / wider window into the universe than with a standard 1/25 " . There is a whole other aspect of astronomy involving wide field of view at lower magnifications which is truly enjoyable . This particular eyepiece is a useful low / medium magnification eyepiece in my opinion and is a very good introduction into 2 " eyepieces to compare their performance to smaller 1.25 " eyepieces . I do not own many 2 " diameter eyepieces and do own a vast arsenal of 1.25 " ones . In my current scope iOptron F12 mak it provides 51x which is a very versatile magnification . I used to have an 8 " F5 reflector and through it provided 29x which was great for deep sky . For the price this is a real bargin if you want to try out a 2 " eyepiece and see the difference . This particular eyepiece seems to be the right size for its function it is ergonomically appealing . I also have a 17mm 2 " Teleview Nagler , which costs significantly more than this one . The Teleview is worth buying if astronomy becomes something of a passion for you . I probably wouldn't have sought out the teleview without having used this particular eyepiece as much as I have . I plan to acquire another 8 " F5 reflecting assembly capable of utilizing 2 " eyepieces as low power wide field deep sky astronomy is just as enjoyable as viewing planets .  
  The mStand laptop stand by Rain Design is extremely high quality and perfectly matches a unibody MacBook Pro . For me , the fixed angle ( and height ) puts my laptop in a good position for preventing neck strain , etc . ; however , I can see where this could be a problem for some . As others have stated the stand now has a cutout on the front where you can easily open a closed laptop . One note on functionality : although I think the stand is designed for use with an external keyboard , I can say that it is not impossible to type while my laptop is on the stand . I really don't find that the computer shakes a great deal , but I also don't type that " hard " . This could be much more of an issue if you are a " hunt and peck " typist .  
  Do not sneeze around this cheaply constructed product or it might crack ! Extremely thin plastic construction . I have already cracked the dvd receptor and there are times that it will not open up to load or unload .  
  i just can't imagine anyone not being happy with this product . when you make any purchase , price has to equate with function to be seen as a " good buy " . this samsung is right there ! the picture is AWSOME ! it 's eye candy in a box . now as far as the price , approx $ 2400 . delivered to my wall unit . it just doesn't get any better than that .  
  I used this card on my Nokia N70 for storing mp3 files . Granted I can't fit my entire music collection on it , but if I wanted to , I 'd buy an iPod . This is perfect for listening to my favourite songs on the go , as well as taking pictures and video clips ! Highly recommended !  
  Do your homework before purchasing this router . It is plagued by firmware issues since day one . I cannot connect both g and n it is an either or . I currently have a bricked DIR-655 due to a firmware update . Search the web for DIR-655 firmware issues . Do Not Buy This Router .. You are better off with an engenius product or and seperate wired router with an wireless accesspoint connected to that .  
  Purchased from Amazon in December 2009 ; Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 400 has nice features and layout , and I really wanted to like it . BUT the spacebar is terrible-much too hard to press , especially from the left and right ends of it , where a touch typist normally would hit it . Mushy spacebar too . The keyboard is ergonomic for all of your hand / wrist except the thumb ; I 'd expect thumb discomfort / pain after a while using it . Returned it for a different keyboard . If you search the internet for the words _ Microsoft spacebar fix _ , you 'll see that this is a common problem ( but doesn't always occur-apparently some have this defect , and others don't ) , and that various people have tried various fixes , but none are really satisfactory . Wish I had seen this before buying it . Maybe a two-finger " hunt and peck " typist wouldn't notice this , but for this touch typist the problematic / defective spacebar is a dealbreaker .  
  I bought this system and loved it . It had decent sound and would play all dvds from all regions ! But , like many others here , after just thirteen months it quit recognizing DVDs at all . It just says LOADING .. NO DISC . I went to Panasonic 's website and it says the laser must be bad . What a pile of cheap junk .  
  I suspected that this product would be a bit flaky with respect to its " magnetic " mounting method-but it fell short of even my lowest expectations . The magnet is quite weak . I should have known better . I will not be using it . It 's hard for me to imagine it really working well for anyone who doesn't intend to glue it to the camera . Even if the lens doesn't fall off , it slides from side to side quite easily as well which will result in undesirable shot composition .  
  Our old GPS unit died recently . After looking at several models , we ordered the TomTom ONE because of its well-designed interface . When we tried to actually use it , though , we discovered that its maps are hopelessly out of date . Our unit ( ordered in August 2007 ) shipped with the version 665 maps , which are a blast from the past . The end of our street is blocked by a barrier has been there for at least 8 years ; our old GPS , a Magellan unit from 1999 , knew about the barrier . The ONE , however , thinks that the barrier does not exist and routes us through it every time we try to go to or from the highway . The TomTom also doesn't know about the new entrance to the San Jose Airport . And that 's just from our first hour of usage ! TomTom sells updated maps , but they cost 99 euros - more than half the price of the unit itself ! Needless to say , we returned the unit . Skip the TomTom ONE and go with a newer model . Or do what we did and buy a Garmin instead .  
  I bought and received this unit and have had it about a week . It is OK for the price and a very entry level system . However , any video or audio buff will be very disappointed . This unit is average all the way around . The DVD player is a DVD player , nothing amazaing , the VCR works , the AM / FM radio works but the antennae and reception is way below average these days , the sound is OK and possibly a bit below average for this low end unit . Overall , for a 2nd system , a very small room , a child , etc this is a reasonable unit . For you main system there are many better options - seperating the VCR from the DVD home theater would get you a much better unit and then just pick up a low cost VCR . Nothing impresses me about this Toshiba . Its barely average all the way around . Owning a higher end Toshiba , this was a disappointment . The remote control color scheme and reflectiveness makes it very difficult to read , small buttons , confusing menu system , non-lighted remote . I give it 2 stars because it does play DVDs and videos fine . However , its radio , sound , remote , and menu 's are way below average . Better off with a cheapie end Koss , Audiovox , etc unit . This Toshiba replaces an older broken GO VIDEO unit for someone who required DVD / VCR . The GO VIDEO unit was several years old and was considered entry level low end at the time . However , it performed better than the Toshiba . The GO VIDEO lacked the CDRW , MP3 , AM / FM , etc features common on today 's current models though . To sum it up , I would pass this unit by and either look at the lower priced units or seperate components and spend more money on a better overall setup .  
  Upon receiving the palmone , I noticed there was no recharger . Since then I have been trying to purchase one in my country , but was told that this is an old model and they don't sell such rechargers . ( I had to pay a more for the delivery than for the palmone , so I didn't want to order one through amazon ) . So , I can't even turn on the palmone ..  
  Bought this camera for my wife in 2008 . I will admit that this camera takes great pictures , when it wants to take them . I must state that again , when it wants to take them . Can't figure out what the problem is . Got to the point that it will hardly take a picture now . Gave up and bought her a Canon . Will try to see if the Nikon can be repaired at a reasonable price . Maybe something simple , but I doubt it .  
  I have an HP LaserJet 4ML ( postscript ) and an HP DeskJet 5550 - relatively common printers . I have a PC running Windows ME and an iMac running OSX . I haven't been able to get either computer to work with either printer ( the printers work fine when connected directly to the computer - but that defeats the purpose of having a print server ) . I struggled with the useless manual for hours , then called tech support ( twice ) . The tech support people seemed as clueless as I was . We walked through the standard printer setup process but still nothing worked . Using the IP address of the server I can use the web browser to see that both printers are connected and properly identified by the server , but for some reason the print jobs won't go through . I bought this product based on the reviews I found here , but somebody should let me in on the secret to setting this thing up . After an hour and a half with tech support ( NOT a toll-free call ) they basically had nothing more to offer . I 'm curious if this is a problem with HP printers - I know HP sells its own print servers - maybe 3rd party servers don't work ? If that is so , somebody should say it . Bottom line - if you intend to use this with an HP printer you may want to ask lots of questions and verify that it will work before you buy it .  
  I have a Panasonic combo DVD / VCR / home theatre system and just got DirecTV . So that amounts to at least two remote controls , since the Panasonic device is nearly impossible to control with any off the shelf multifunction remote . It just has too many custom buttons like those for the subwoofer volume and surround sound options . So enters the Logitech Harmony remote . Alas , it was not quite up to the task . Pros : Has configuration for many many many devices . Has one-touch buttons for doing combo tasks such as " turn on the TV and play a DVD " all in one swoop . Cons : Software is a little confusing if you want to reprogram one button . Not enough buttons to handle all the functions of a more sophisticated combo device like the Panasonic I have . The biggest irritant about the control is you can't easily switch on or off one device without messing up the " one touch " control . So if you already have the TV on , then hit the one touch button to watch a DVD , the TV will turn off because it receives the the power signal from the remote again . If you use this Logitech remote ONLY , it theoretically remembers which devices are on and off and sends only the relevant signals when you use the one-touch macro buttons . But if you use any other remote with your devices it just adds to the confusion . Ultimately I bought a " Universal " ( that 's the brand name ) R7 remote . This one can be programmed a lot easier than the Logitech and has a terrific instruction manual . It works similar to other standard remotes and in the end was much simpler and cheaper than this Logitech .  
  Going to be jogging / running ? Get a flash based player . Not going to be jogging / running ? Get a drive based player . First one I got worked for 1 min . then the nav . stick would not go up , even w / the remote so I had to exchange it . Using 2100Mah NiMH batteries worked for a couple of months then it just kept freezing even w / new batteries . Suffice to say I have to use alkalines now . Battery life is poor , about 8-10 hours w / alkaline batteries . I 'm looking for an iRiver ( 17hrs avg . play time on 1AA battery ) . For 2AA bateries I expect better life . Updated firmware helped bugs but not battery usage even w / the backlight off all the time . compact flash door is a but flimsy but I keep it in the included case so it is not much of an issue . Radio recording is okay but the reception sucks and is restricted to 64kbps only . I don't use the voice recording but if I went back to grad school I 'm sure I would . Sound is extremely good but not w / the included headphones . Use your own . User EQ is a nice feature but every player has that now . I 've had this Nex IA since Summer 2003 , a month after it was released . Too bad there is no better compact flash based player w / radio . Compare the features of this player and the iRiver 390T or 395T series players and you 'd be willing to give up the compact flash player for it , especially for the ability to encode to MP3 at any bit rate w / line in . I thought that I could use this as an all around MP3 player but am restriced to using it only when jogging / running because of the battery life . Pros : Great sound w / other headphones ( SQL and SPL ) , Nice display , compact flash based if you use compact flash memory a lot for digital cams and USB memory , nice white / acrylic look . Cons : Too many freeze ups , Poor battery life for 2 AA , flimsy construction , Poor radio reception , old for its time . There are better alternatives but unfortunately no alternatives if you are looking for compact flash based players .  
  I loved this router until I got an Iphone . There was some sort of glitch : it would not work with the Iphone . I searched through on-line sources for the answer without coming up with a good one . I spent hours on the phone with people at Dlink . Finally after repeated calls , a technician at DLink got it to work . I would have preferred if it worked immediately-I really can't afford to spend that much time working on this problem . But , overall , the DLink has been good-fast connection for my Laptop , and now for the Iphone . D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router  
  I bought this product and it worked well for a month or so . Then the headset would not take a charge . I returned them and they sent me a new unit . Two months later the new unit will not take a charge . I am sending them back now . The unit sounds good when working and the cordless feature is great for the gym but the battery life on the Ipod is cut to about 3 hours maximum with this unit . I am constantly chargeing my Ipod . I have read other reviews about moisture on the headset . Mine get soaked at the gym but so far customer service has not said a work about it . they are good to deal with but you have the shipping costs and the time lag to deal with . All in all I think it is easier to put up with the cord and have you unit last longer than it is to fool around with these especially at the cost .  
  It clogged with paper from the outset . A big waste of money , lots of frustration . It will not reliably feed papers larger than 8.5 wide . Epson really should recall because of the feeding problems . I have kneeled and prayed beside it . I cant believe that it is still on the market . It is a very old model . Can I say anything worse about it . Oh yes , if it get confused , because of an error , you have got to shut power down to the house , wait for a day and then turn it back on again . If it does not feed , it will then start printing gibberish for days on end .  
  I actually bought this at a local store . It works but every once in awhile , the remote will reset and I 'd have to get out the book to re-enter the code for my tv . There 's no explanation as to why but I am getting pretty tired of resetting the remote . Maybe be cheap but it doesn't work . :(  
  first of all the battery and the charger were the wrong ones , so i didnt get to record my grandson 's graudation . i was so disappointed about the video camara . so right now it is in a box put away . No battery that fits . No charger either . So I rate this video camara a big ZERO  
  Why spend more for a top-quality optical cable with a brand name like Monster ? In the digital realm , the bits are either getting to your amplifier , or they 're not . It 's hard to imagine how one optical interconnect could be better than another . Better cables matter when you are connecting speakers , but I can't see how they would matter here . So , buy something cheaper . Or , write another review , if you can explain to us consumers why this might be better .  
  Fair printer , but does an absolutely lousy job on printing envelopes . Also after 350 pages of operation , the overall print quality is getting lighter . I wrote Samsung , they sent me a new firmware patch . I installed it , reset the printer and I think it got worse . The envelope printing is almost too light to read now . I cannot recommend this printer if you want to print envelopes .  
  This keyboard is the cheapest feeling keyboard I 've ever used . Only after a few days of typing the keys started to stick and requires a little more effort to press some keys . In general it feels more stiff when typing rather than a nice cushy feel . This never happened from the other 5 keyboards I 've used . If you really want to get a Microsoft keyboard then try getting the Elite which I also own . As for the ergonomic layout , I 've noticed that it 's not completely neccesary . If I use a standard keyboard that doesn't try to save money by compacting the keys together then I don't get wrist problems . You have to find a keyboard that provides a good amount of space between each keys . Although you still need to use a wrist pad and the flatter the keyboard the better . But no matter what you do don't waste your money on this keyboard .  
  I 've had this product for 2 years , there has never been any FW updates . It will work for a bit , then mouse will mess up . buttons , scroll wheel , left and right button signals get mixed . Some times powering down all devices ( pain ) and unplugging the power to the kvm will fix it , but not always . Extended function for you mouse will not work so forget the joys of that . Support is as bad as it could get , if you have a weak heart just put it in the trash and save yourself .  
  My son recieved this for his 2nd Christmas . He loves this TV , but the DVD player boke after 1 year . It kept spinning and then the TV started turning itsself off after 45 seconds . I am so upset with Disney . Repair shops won't repair it and I am very upset .  
  Purchased this Battery in October , 2009 , as a back up . It was installed late November , 2009 and Died early March 2010 . This time I found a Panasonic battery for my Panasonic phone for half the price . Time will tell if it will last any longer , but it could not be any worse , and if it is the same , it cost me 1/2 the price .. I can not recommend this battery  
  Prints great pictures when it works ! Twice I have bought the expensive paper / color cartridge combination packs and have had the color cartridge run out before the paper . Contact Kodak and give you all kind of excuses which none of apply . Can't buy just another color cartridge . Now I have 50 sheets of paper and no color cartridge to print them with .. Would never buy another KODAK printer .  
  For simple LAN use this is the perfect choice , great configuration options as far as DHCP and DMZ , however , what is not openly admitted is that this is not a true 100mbps router . Your uplink port , ( where you dsl / cable modem ) hooks up is limited to 10mbps , so regardless of the fact that your hub / switch is 100mbps , from internet to the pcs is 10mbps , translation , you just got slowed down from your normal capabilities . Especially if you have your cable modem tweaked to where it runs 8-10 times faster than normal , you will want to throw this in the trash first time you use internet / LAN communications for games .  
  Tried it with a USB flash drive and ( a ) could not find a channel without lots of static , ( b ) took 30-60 seconds to move between songs and ( c ) third time I used it nothing happened at all , and it stopped working permanently . Oh well , serves me right for not reading the other reviews .  
  My old ink jet was better than this printer . There are ghost images on the pages and envelopes always print crooked . I needed a printer and the one I wanted was on back order . I now wish that I had waited for the one with great reviews !  
  I used this product to stream movies from a computer to TV . The product worked great for picture quality but only lasted for 2 uses before the end broke off one of the connectors . HDMI connectors do not reattach so this cable is now worthless . I would recommend spending more to get a better made product . That is what I will now have to do .  
  I wouldn't buy these again and wish I hadn't paid so much for them either . ( around $ 9 ) I 've had them for less then 5 months . At first they were perfect because they matched my pink Ipod , i thought the gooey stuff would feel nice .. etc . I didn't have any problem with the sound quality . The problems I have / had with it is the first month after I would use them the outer ear ( where they sit ) would feel sore . ( I don't listen to the music loud either so it wasn't that . ) My ear doesn't hurt anymore after a use , so you will get use to the discomfort . Then main reason I wouldn't buy this earphone again is because the white cord sticks with dirt like glue . After awhile no matter what i used ( clorox wipes , water , hand soap ) i couldn't get it to return to it 's nice white color and now it looks off-white or basically dirty . I also didn't like the part that connects the earphones to the Ipod or whatever you connect it too . For me , I like to slip my Ipod in my back pocket when i need to use both hands for something , well because there is a bend in the plug , it pops out of my pocket , disconecting from the Ipod . ( The Ipod earphones stick straight out and are as thin as the Ipod ) Since I 'm a student I haven't gotten around to , or feel like spending money , to get another , different set , I strongly advise you not to buy this product . If anything I would recommend the normal Ipod earphones , or keep searching for some better ones .  
  After paying a lot of money for this product , I was expecting something nice . I sure was disappointed ! What a piece of crap ! First off , the lamp is mediocre at best . Yes , it gets bright enough to read with but that is where it stops . The lampost is very cheaply made of two pieces held together with a poorly designed plastic insert . I came home after vacation and the lampost had collapsed at the plastic junction . OK - Lifetime Warranty - I should be OK here .. Secondly , the company advertises a " lifetime warranty " . That turns out to be a joke . The company offered to sell me another lamp with a 10 % disount ! Thirdly - angela @ fullspectrumsolutions . com simply states that there is no warrany on this lamp despite the claim on their website it has a ' lifetime warranty ' . Now , you got me once when I bought something with a lifetime warranty . Now you want me to pay for another one because the first on fell apart ? This company does not deserve to sell things on AMAZON ! Please think seriously before buying a product from FullSpectrumSolutions . You will be disappointed !  
  I don't know how far the wireless routers are supposed to work , but this one only works a few feet . Certainly not in another room .  
  This headset has decent , although not the greatest sound . The thing I HATE about them is the cord gets horribly twisted . I have to fix the cable every day and as time passes this gets worse . The cable is so twisted now I can no loner fix it . It 's as if there 's a wire running through it . I use the headset for many hours a day . My ears get extremely sore . There 's no way to adjust the width . I would not recommend this product .  
  This amplifier is a good enough design aesthetically for me . Also the amplification provided is enough for my casual use ( hooking up computer or TV to in-wall speakers , indoors and backyard ) . I am not an audiophile so if the sound quality is not as true to source , it doesn't bother me ( in other words I can't tell the difference mostly ) . Given all that , I was really hoping for this to work out for me - as I am just not comfortable spending significantly more on a simple amplifier that suits my need . But it didn't work out . I ordered it , and right out the box only half the output worked ( I think it 's called channel ) . So whether I had speaker A or B selected , only my left speaker ( say ) would work not the right . I tried to play around to see if the problem was my input , but no it was the amplifier . I was able to hook two speakers by using a common Red connection ( the one side that was working ) while taking the black separately ( which was working on both sides ) . Just as a test , not that I was going to use it like that . I called customer service with a hope that there might be an easy fix . They were great . Within the first couple of minutes they recommended me to just send it back and get a replacement . I would rate their customer service 5 stars , but on this review I want to stay true to spirit and only rate the product - which is a 1 star in my opinion . Needless to say I didn't exchange the product , but simply sent back to Amazon for a refund . I 'll keep looking to find an acceptable solution elsewhere .  
  Here 's the good stuff : great isolation from outside noise , comfortable , damned near excellent bass , and very power efficient . But I 'm returning my pair to Tower Records where I just bought them for $ 15 . Why ? Because the sound itself is truly awful : compressed , dead , flat , hazy , and tinny ( the great bass notwithstanding ) . These ' phones literally suck the life out of my music , by destroying its dynamics , detail , rhythm , tonal accuracy , and high frequencies , and then layering a harsh fuzziness on top of that . I can't say enough bad things about the actual sound . I suspect you can have a more rewarding musical experience at your dentist 's office . I know I did .  
  First , let me say that I 've been buying Tripp Lite products for nearly 20 years , in fact I have another LC-1800 that I bought new in 1995 - 17 years ago . Though the model number was the same , the design was very different then . The problem with any sort of power protection device is that unless you have the right equipment to measure what it actually does , and you have the time to perform such tests , you don't REALLY know how well protected you are . Many people sing the praises of this or that line conditioner , this or that UPS , etc . - but until something happens with their power , they don't really know . Having said that , I recently bought a very high end HDTV and was interested in protecting it mostly from brownouts that we sometimes have here , usually during severe storm season ( U.S. Midwest ) . The candidates for this included the LC-1800 and an APC UPS ( model BR1500G ) . There were other candidates but I 'll leave those out since I dropped them off the list for completely unrelated reasons , and never did test them . Before buying anything , I contacted the tech support departments of both Tripp Lite and APC in order to find out how much voltage correction these units were capable of providing . Frankly the contact with Tripp Lite was what I had come to expect : a human being , speaking English , based in the U.S. , and willing to at least try to answer every question I had . The contact with APC turned out to be an e-mail from India , and it took two tries before any meaningful information came forth from them . So the LC-1800 and the APC UPS both arrived . I do want to say that my test results are based on the assumption that I did not get a defective unit . It 's always possible that mine was defective , but I 'm not interested in spending any more time messing with this . Tripp Lite had told me that during a brownout condition , the LC-1800 should boost output voltage up to nearly 120V if input dropped to as low as around 90V . MOST IMPORTANTLY , they said that if input voltage dropped to the point where the unit couldn't boost the voltage back to useable levels , it would instantly and cleanly shut off output completely , so as to not subject the connected equipment to a severe undervoltage condition . I connected the LC-1800 to a variac , a device which allows you to control the amount of AC voltage supplied . I used a Fluke DVM to monitor the voltage supplied by the variac , so that I could be sure of the points at which the LC-1800 's behavior changed . I 'll point out that in one of my calls with Tripp Lite , they suggested that I use a variac if I wanted to be certain about the unit 's performance . Starting at 120V from the variac and slowly dropping the voltage , the LC-1800 reported the line voltage as " Low " when the voltage dropped to 113V , and it boosted the output from the LC-1800 to 123V . Very nice . It reported the line voltage as " Very low " when the voltage got down to 103V , and output from the LC-1800 remained at 122V . Again , this is just what I 'd expect . The problem lies in the fact that as line voltage continued to drop ( as it easily could during a brownout ) , the LC-1800 NEVER DID SHUT OFF THE OUTPUT . As line voltage dropped to 50V , the LC-1800 was still outputting 60V . As I continued to drop the line voltage , the output from the LC-1800 simply continued to drop , all the way down to less than 10V . That was all I needed to see on the LC-1800 and it 's in the process of being returned . I went through the same process with the APC UPS . It 's not a magic bullet either ; its automatic voltage regulation function ( similar , at least in concept , to what the LC-1800 uses ) will allow the connected equipment to see voltage as low as about 100V during a brownout , and as high as 128V during an overvoltage condition , before it switches to battery - which then provides 115V for as long as the battery can hold out . The difference is , it HAS a battery to switch to , and doesn't attempt to keep boosting ( or trimming ) voltage no matter how low ( or high ) the line voltage goes . Don't get me wrong - a line conditioner and a UPS are two completely different animals intended for different applications . The reason I 'm comparing them is that they both provide ( and their advertising makes a big point of ) automatic voltage regulation in order to protect connected equipment from undervoltages and overvoltages . My new TV doesn't " need " to stay on during a storm , therefore I have no need for a UPS per se - but I do want it protected from wild variations in voltage , and it seems that in order to get this , I need the additional functionality of a UPS . You might need it too , if you 're considering the purchase of a line conditioner . I 'm laying out the data here so that you can make a more informed decision . I may buy another LC-1800 in the future , but it won't be to protect anything from brownouts . If you aren't concerned with brownouts , and only want to stabilize your line voltage which is already assumed to be within a reasonable range , the LC-1800 can do a fine job . But , the one I received does not perform as Tripp Lite 's tech support department said it would , and it 's a LONG way from performing to the level implied by their advertising in my opinion .  
  May not ( or will not ) fully charge high capacity cells - this issue is reported in reviews on other websites . My experience : 2100mAh cells ( non-Kodak ) won't fully charge , but cells get real warm . Switching to another brand charger DOES complete the charge , and cells are cooler . Specification sheet ( K605 . pdf ) : Maximum size for this charger is 2100mAh - these cells are supposed to take 17.5 hours . BUT charger also automatically shuts off at 17.5 hours , regardless . ( Go figure . )  
  My tv was delivered 30 days ago and it has already broken ! The bulb , which is suppossed to last 10,000 hours , has gone out . My husband did some research on-line and found lots of people complaining about this problem . The authorized repair facility is trying to find out from Panasonic if it 's a problem with the bulb or a deeper problem with the tv . The picture is great and I would like to rate this a 5 , but a $ 2700 tv that breaks after 30 days qualifies for a low score . In all fairness , I will update this once the problem is resolved . I just think we should have waited a year or two for them to resolve all issues before purchasing this item . We ended up exchanging the tv because Panasonic couldn't give us a time frame on the bulb . The new one has been in place for a week and my husband is in love again . I 'm reserving judgement for 30 days .  
  black ink was inoperative . Screwed up my machine . when I put factory ink in-worked like a charm . Ink package looked like it had been run over by a truck  
  As others who have written before me , I purchased this device to replace an old 10-base HUB ( D-Link , another low-cost , low-quality vendor ) . It worked fine for the first few days , then I started experiencing network outages from within the LAN . I tried troubleshooting everything ; NIC 's , cables , the computers themselves . It came down to two test systems who , when connected via a cross-over cable worked just fine . The moment I placed the Linksys EZXS88W between them , the network became flakey , not just slowing to less than 10mbps , many times disconnecting all together while the indicator lights flickered indicating it was at least trying . Replacing the Linksys switch with the old D-Link 10mbps hub the network was magically all better . ALL equipment was thoroughly checked , and the weak component was without question the Linksys switch . This is not the first Linksys item I have had the displeasure of working with , however it is both the first and last Linksys product I have personally purchased . Do yourself a favor , friend ; spend the extra $ 50-$100 and buy a decent switch from a more reputable vendor . The money you " save " isn't worth the hassles .  
  Seriously , take the $ 10 bucks that this would cost you ( with shipping ) and wrap it around your iPod . It will provide better protection . I have the 80GB iPod and this case does not fit properly , but even if it did the only thing that this " case " would provide protection against is a breeze , maybe .  
  I purchased two of these in April , 2009 . The first failed in the second month , the second just failed today . In both cases , I received the message " memory card error " in two different cameras ( neither would read them ) . Nothing like losing hundreds of pictures to make you really happy about a product . The low price isn't worth losing photos .  
  Bought this got it a week later which was great . Setup is a breeze you don't need a manual to set it up all you need is 2 3.5mm headphone jacks and boom your ready to go . My unit seems to be defective because it seems like audio is mono which sucks and customer support seems to be non existent .  
  This headset actually works well , but it is so uncomfortable to wear that I don't use it . I found success with the Panasonic KX-TCA60 Hands-Free Headset with Comfort Fit Headband and the Headset Buddy Adapter 01-PH25-PC35 Phone Headset to PC Adapter . That combination not only sounds great , but it so comfortable I forget to take it off .  
  My first router back in 2003 was D-Link and I hated and again 7 years later I 'm hating it still . it seems like the whole UI is speaking foreign language to me . I tried to set up for 3 days and couldn't get it to work properly ( schedules , USB HD , PRinter .. ) , so it went back . If you could speak D-Link language , it seem like it 's capable of lots of neat things , but I don't have time . Now I got myself Netgear N300 and finished setting up within couple of hours .  
  The unit won't stay connected in the socket . I tried it in several 12V sockets and it will only maintain a connection when it is held in firmly , at a specific angle . I 'm glad I didn't pay much for it .  
  This product has great sound quality , both listening and speaking . The one downside to it is that it 's not fully adjustable for those with smaller heads . We bought this for use by the entire family and found that the sizing adjustments available do not adjust small enough . As a result , it fits loosely for younger people or those with a smaller head size .  
  I use this on weekends and have found it very reliable . The design of the on / off switch is terrible . You have to take it apart to find the switch to turn it on or off . 2 weeks after I started using it one switch broke right off . The switches are small and poorly designed . I remove the batteries now to shut it off . Like I said before TERRIBLE design but very accurate .  
  How can you sell a high-tech consumer product in September 2007 and don't have support for Windows Vista ? According to a forum page on their website , Linksys has promised to have the driver released soon . I talked to their chatline today , and they told me the driver was going to be released soon . Since the forum page starts to mention " soon " back in February , I don't really trust that the drivers will be available soon .  
  Out of the box it was great . Easy to understand , big bright screen , multiple options for voices , etc .. I got it as a birthday present ( 4/28 ) and I 'm already fed up with it ( 5/1 ) and sending it back . The unit 's been really fickle about turning on . I 've already had to hit the Reset button 5-7 times . Also , the car adapter AND the home cradle don't charge the unit either . It may have just been a bad unit , but I 'm trying one of the other brands next .  
  I have been a big fan of these printers . I own one vintage unit from when they were CoStar LabelWriters , and 2 LabelWriter 330 units . I still love the functionality , BUT .. now both of my 330s ( one at home , one in the office ) have suffered power supply failures . Dymo 's solution is to send them back for a $ 75 repair ( each ) . That 's a large fraction of the purchase price . The power supplies lived through the warranty period , but not much longer .. so the calculation you must make is whether a unit that lives just about that long is worth the purchase price . It is possible , of course , that current models are more reliable . Or not .  
  This unit looks exactly like the unit I already own for my 990CXi . I do not need two of them . I only use one at a time . If HP just left the serial numbet the same , i could choose to buy one or use the one I have . Next time I 'll buy Canon . The printers are about the same , but i don't feel like I am being deceived and cheated . Paul Beirne39 Peter Coutts CirclePalo Alto , CA 94305650-493-0874  
  I bought this set looking for 1080p . when i pluged in my xbox360 and turned on the 1080p option it did no work . i then looked in the tv manual to find that there is no mention of 1080p it stopped at 1080i . sucks huh  
  When I brought my cybershot I purchased two separate bags for it . One for that was cute and sleek for carrying and the other that could be used for storing the camera and its many essentials . This bag is designed really weird for the sleek cybershot camera . For starters there is not secure compartment on the inside of the bag to secure to camera .. just a big open space . So , the slim camera just wobbles around all inside the bag . Makes me think that maybe it was designed for some other camera ? Second it 's not very roomy to hold batteries , cables or extra memory cards . If you 're looking for that - go bigger ! After buying this bag .. it 's sat in my closet for months . I 'm only upset that I posted this review before trying to resell it on eBay .  
  This FM transmitter had to be within inches of the radio antennae to clearly pick up the music being played . I do not recommend it for use in a vehicle . Works ok if the iPod can be situated right next to the antennae . I tried many stations for broadcasting which didn't seem to help in the car .  
  I bought the APC BE350R UPS . In less than a year the battery died and there is no way to silence the alarm except with a new battery . The battery costs more than I paid for the unit . Go with CyberPower .  
  Eventhough it 's good and fast due to SD card bandwidth interface , compared to MMC and Sony memory stick . Palm 16 MB SD card is too expensive . The price of [ money ] , you can buy at least 32 MB or even 64 MB of Sandisk SD card from some stores . Moreover , 16 MB is not enough anymore when most of the professional palm programs are among 4-5 MB .  
  I bought this screen for a number of reasons . 1 - Because it is much cheaper than the electric version which costs about 4 times more . 2 - It got a good review . and3 - I was projecting onto a greyish wall and thought a screen would give me a cleaner brighter image while still maintaining good contrast . I experienced number of problems with this screen : 1 - The packaging is poor . Yes it is held in cardboard box with styrofoam at the ends . But the styrofoam protection was clearly insufficient and was only at the two ends . It had less than one inch from the box . Needless to say the screen got a good shaking up in transit to me and this was evident when i opened the box . 2- I know how to pull out and retract screens . Plus i read the manual carefully and followed the instructions for installation and use . I pulled it out about 80 % after installation . When I tried retracting it it never retracted . It just came right out . It never once tried to pull back in . So now it is fully rolled out and is not retracting . I was gentle with it and had followed the retract instructions . 3 . It is a step up from using a wall . But the whites are horrid . The overall picture is cleaner but the contrast is not improved infact the blacks are slightly more grey than on the wall cause it is a white screen . The whites sparkle and glisten in a big way . Like there are tiny grains of sand that are reflecting white into all the colors of the rainbow like little diamonds . All the colors except black and white are fine . I am disappointed with my purchase of this screen . Even if I got a faulty screen The blacks and whites are not properly reproduced . In movies with lots of white like snow scenes the sparkling is very very distracting .  
  I am very disapointed with this camera . The only good thing that I can say is that the camera has a pretty cool swivel lens which allows you to take pictures at all sorts of weird angels . The quality of the pictures are also good . Everything else is pretty bad . Because of the position of the lens , it is VERY easy to get a fingerprint on it . I have many ruined pictures because of this . There is also a red eye problem with this camera . In almost all the pictures that I have taken with the flash on , the people had red eye . Also , there is no viewfinder . Taking pictures at night is a real pain with this camera because all you can see on the LCD screen is black . It can take a few seconds before you begin to see something on the screen , and even then it is very hard to make out what your camera is pointed at . If you were thinking about purchasing a Nikon Coolpix , don't . There are better cameras out there .  
  We bought this camera last year right before Christmas . It is okay outside , but terrible inside . If there is the slightest movement the pictures are blurry . We have tried all different settings with the same result and are very unhappy with the product .  
  Bought from CablesToGo .. they shipped a different cable than this , which is not at all a substitute for this product ; it is not 6 feet , not 3.5mm , and not a m / m stereo audio cable . but it was black . so that 's one out of four . so I 'm not really sure how to review . Watch out for this store ..  
  We first got this router in June 2007 , following the failure of a D-Link wireless router . We have two desktop computers , an all-in-one printer , and 2 ( or more ) wireless laptops on our home network , all XP . Our ISP comes via a 2ghz wireless transmission . I ignored the CD , since we are on a static IP and I know how to input the numbers . First problem was that the router wouldn't accept Firefox input ; I had to switch to IE . Once up & running , however , it worked wonderfully well-very fast on the wired computers , with solid connections for the wireless laptops throughout our 3-story house . Then in mid-July we left on vacation . Upon return , we discovered the router had completely lost the capability to deliver a wireless signal , despite reboots . So , we exchanged it for another . This one set up flawlessly in Firefox . Again , we were happy campers-for two weeks . Another out-of-town trip and another failure ( mid-August now ) . This time , the home network & wireless signal continued functioning , but it could not connect to the WAN , despite numerous reboots . We exchanged once again ( we were dealing with Staples , which was to our benefit at least ) , although the router had to be dropped shipped to us-meaning a delay of about 3 days . This time , I remembered that manually entering the IP numbers required IE . But , it didn't take ! So , I switched to Firefox-no luck . Back to IE again-third try worked and again we got the fast , stable performance we expected-but only for one more week . At the end of the first week of Sept , our valley experienced some heavy rains & lightning . After one strike across the valley , the router blinked ( despite being on back-up power & surge protection ) and we lost the internet signal again . Wireless & home network still worked , however . That was enough . Back to the store , exchanged for a Linksys WRT350N , and we 're up & running again . The Linksys does not seem quite as fast , but it 's stable and manually configuring the router was a breeze .  
  Xm Auto Cassette AdapterWithin minutes of using this product , I realized that this was too cheap and that I could not use it . Don't waste your money .  
  Had to return this item - it did not fit my CyberShot Camera as the keyed plug would not fit my camera 's port . The description did not make me realize there could be differing keyed adapters , since it just said it was for Cyber Shot Cameras . Now I know there must be differences , so I would not order this if your camera model is like mine .  
  The screen is awesome , the dent it came with is not . This thing is so massive ( which i like ) , i imagine its hard to transport it without getting damaged . My money I used to pay for this product was not damaged , so the product purchased should not be damaged either .  
  If you want a good product stay away from Tom Tom products . I have used 3 different products from tom tom and maybe I 'm a slow learner or tom tom has bad products , just stay away from tom tom so many better gps units to buy that are better . Not worth the money , bought a download and it turned out to be the wrong one and they will not fix the problem or give a refund . STAY AWAY FROM TOM TOM  
  I 've owned two of these and both stopped working about 40 days after purchase . I tried everything on online forums and at griffin 's website to no avail . Neither were damaged but they refused to transmit . I recently bought a similar product by iRiver that charges itself from your cigarette lighter jack and noticed the signal was stronger than iTrip 's . The interface is easier to use too and you don't have to fumble with playlists trying not to accidentally reset the transmitting station like you do with iTrip .  
  Okay , i 've read all the glowing reviews , the ones that made me purchase the unit and all i can say is wow ! This player was horrible , just horrible . From the time i opened the box , the screen didn't have a protective film on it and the screen was covered in swirl marks , like a bad car detail job . Playing the dvds brought another problem , the player can just stop and freeze up controls with no warning , in addition the player etched the outside edge of the disc , and we are talking etch , not scratch ! The only good thing out of all this was that i got it from here , Amazon , and they took it back no problem . Maybe i got a lemon , who knows , it 's sad because the feel of the player makes you think it is good quality plus they give you a bunch of extras ( headphones ect ) , but locking up and etching the dvds is not worth it .  
  .. so why does it cost so much ? I got this because it was very small and could be a MP3 player as well as a camera . I was hoping to replace my 1.3Mpixel Kodak digital camera . I 'm still using the Kodak . This camera has extremely poor color and focus . Images from it look like they were taken with a cheap webcam . The zoom is entirely digital , so it just makes the bad pictures worse . The MP3 playback is also bad . It does play MP3s , but I found that it had excessive treble and very little bass , so everything sounded tinny . The user interface is not bad for the photo modes , but it isn't very good for playing MP3s , especially if you have a lot of MP3s . I was so disappointed with this that I 've entirely stopped using it , in favor of a single-function digital camera that is nearly 5 years old .  
  I purchased this TV from a big box retailer in July of 2007 . I chose this one after looking at the picture and color compared with the others in the store and I was very impressed . It worked get for the first six months . Easy to set up and to use with all my different components ( dvd , vcr , sound system , cablebox ) . However , six months later , I have been having some horrible problems with it . It scrambles and has some horrible color problems ( whites are showing up pink and blown out details ) . I started calling Westinghouse after the first of the year and got the run around . I had the cable company out to check the signal , switched out 2 cable boxes , and did the factory reset a couple of hundred times . It took calling every week for a month to get them working on this . Finally , I was able to get them to send me a box and now its been sitting with them to make whatever decision they are going to make . Although this may have been a rare problem with my particular tv , I feel the way in which it was being dealt with was inexcusable . If a product has a warranty , it should be dealt with in a swift manner . This is a lot of money to be messing with . I would look elsewhere for a better company who respects their customers .  
  This is NOT a backup battery for your IPod . The TuneJuice2 will only work if your IPod already has a charge . To quote from the packaging " .. an IPod with a completely discharged internal battery will not be able to make use of TuneJuice 's battery backup capability " . So if you have visions of attaching TuneJuice2 to your dead IPod and getting unlimited playtime by just popping in new AA batteries , do not buy this product ! The text on the Amazon web page for TuneJuice2 says " Ever run out of iPod battery without a power source in sight ? " . I think if you buy this product you will realize how misleading it is .  
  Cover not worth it , does not fit right , smells like chemical . Swivel clip broke same day I used it , wrist strap irritated my skin .  
  I 've got some experience with universal remotes all the way back to a huge programmable one with a timer in the 1980 's . In the last few years I haven't needed one because I stopped watching TV but now that I have an HDTV and a DVD player that plays AVI files I wanted to put away the three remotes to keep the living room clean . The initial software install , device selection and firmware upgrade all went smoothly . One problem though : although the software doesn't display the current or new firmware version so there 's no way to tell if you need a firmware upgrade . I 'm not sure what the point of offering a firmware upgrade button without telling you what the old and new firmware versions are . Once I unplugged the USB cable and tried to use the remote , the problems started . Maybe I 'm not their typical user because I don't need complex macros or 50 buttons . I just do three or four actions : power toggle , volume up / down , channel selection , or switch inputs . The first thing I noticed is that * THERE IS NO POWER BUTTON * . You have to control the power state of your devices by defining " activities " and the remote helpfully tries to manage all the power states of your devices this way . Unfortunately half the time it failed to turn the DVD player on . So then I have to read the tiny LCD screen and walk through a series of " help screens " that ask if each device is on or off . The whole point of a universal remote is to simplify .. so it 's very frustrating when I find myself reading little lines of dialog and walking through a wizard-type interface when all I wanted was a power button . Strike 1 . Once I started looking more carefully at the remote , I immediately realized how terrible the UI is . Maybe I 'm wrong but I would bet that there 's a few buttons that are used 98 % of the time : channel select , input select , volume , and the play / stop / forward / reverse buttons . yet there is basically no functional power button , and the volume and channel keys are small and flush with the surface of the remote . Why would someone design a universal remote this way ? Strike 2 . To change channels with a digital television ( or any television , after February 2009 ) , you need to use a separator in the channel number like 2-1 or 2.1 . But there is no separator key . I 'm sure I could use my TV remote to learn the key and then map it onto another key on the 550 but there 's no obvious buttons I could use for this . So that 's strike 3 . I guess the Logitech Harmony has the honor of being the first electronics device I ever return to a store because it sucks . I don't see why it 's hard to take the best feature of the Harmony remotes ( online database of device codes ) and match it with a simple obvious UI.I bought a $ 10 sony universal remote instead and it was a hassle to teach it the code for every button but after a couple hours it worked fine .  
  Beyond lousy . The instructions are incomplete and contradictory . I 'll spend a couple C-notes to buy a video capture device that will work .  
  After having found the first shipment of my order dated 12/17/2007 which I had to return as defective due to the Output from the HDMI not working . I returned the first unit and received a replacement from Electronica on January 12 . After connecting I found this defective also and have requested a RMAR from Electronica for a full refund . I do not know whether it is Electronica or D-Link at fault but after having paid over $ 60.00 in shipping costs , I am not satisfied with the service I have been given . D-Link DSM-520 MediaLounge Wireless HD Media Player  
  I own two of these .. unfortunately . These work great for the first six months or so but , then totally begin to fail on you in many ways . One only wished i had figured this out before i bought the second one . Now my second one is starting to have problems . These machine are NOT worth the headache . Buyer beware !  
  If you 're going to use this headset about once a month , you won't notice anything wrong with it . But if you use it for any type of gaming , you 'll notice after about two hours the headset feels tight and your ears start aching . Then you 'll notice that with repeated use the sound quality becomes worse and worse , until anytime you try speaking into the mic you are greeted with distortion and static . The cord is really cheap , will continually get wrapped around itself , until it finally ruins the connection and your ability to use the mic at all . Don't buy these . You 'll just end up replacing them .  
  I have used Monster brand products before and always had good results , but the first time I plugged 2 items into this strip it blew out . I would not recommend this to anyone !  
  When I first bought this scanner , I thought it was one of the best for the money . The scans were fairly quick till you scanned at 300 dpi and more . It was easy to install , and the software was based for an intermediate user . A few bells and whisiles . But four months after using the scanner , It started to slow down , and eventually went from one scan every 40 sec . to one scan every 15 minutes . HP was no help , they led me to correct the problem that did nothing but cause conflicts and lock-ups . Not to mention there are no drivers to be found for the 6200 series scanners . So just please be careful . I suggest you don't buy this scanner at all .  
  I am the first one to admit that I love my toys , and while I have mellowed in my old age , I have owned a lot of audio and visual equipment over the years . I was really excited to be getting my first flat screen TV , and figured a product from Phillips Magnavox would be a good one . Well , I was wrong . Let me begin by saying that this TV is only four and a half months old ! Major technical issues have arisen in which the TV makes horrible noises and shuts itself off . I looked around online and found lots of other people have had the same problem as well . Then you have to call their technical support , which is just a great way to kill some time before they come back and tell you to take it to a local service center , and that labor is coming out of your pocket . They will however let you know " how sorry they are to hear that , " about 7 or 8 times . Not a great product , poor service , not super cheap either . Try another brand , especially if you are going to spend this kind of money .  
  I 've gone threw 3 of these cheap Walmart knock offs . When they work they work fine you just have to be smart enough to calibrate a microphone . But the first time you roll over the 20 foot cord , there done . If you can't afford anything else go for it but your better of buying a higher qaulity mic because they break like the cheap headsets that they are .  
  Were not in original HP15 boxes . The boxes were white and blank . Leaves a little suspicion . Not sure they are HP15 The cartridge was funny looking .  
  Sony Vaio 's are a defective product and should not be sold . Once you have a problem customer service / repairs / refunds are non existant and they repeatedly get you off the phone telling you that they will have someone call you back . Never yet a call back ! DON'T buy the Sony Vaio and if you do or have please file a complaint with the BB online .  
  This product was purchased through the Amazon . com web site . This product had to have been a discontinued item . This is another item which is best purchased in your local area . I purchased this product on Amazon . com and it arrived in good time . There was a CD that came with the product , but only the driver would install . There is more software supposedly on the CD but it would not install to my PC which has Windows Vista 64 bit on it . I got the suggested Bluetooth software from the manufactures website " Widcom " . The software does not install due to digital signature issues with this manufacturer . I have the driver installed , but the Bluetooth device does not work as it should . All this hardware can do is search for Bluetooth devices , find them , then it cant do anything else , because it has no software to operate with . I will have to try other Bluetooth software to see if it will work with this device . This device is not something that I would reccommend . I would not purchase this product again . Money wasted .  
  After about 2 months this charger started heating up like crazy . It got so hot that it MELTED the plastic casing . You should see how disfigured it looks . I would not buy this again . It actually left a burn mark on my couch where it was sitting . TERRIBLE PRODUCT .  
  The sound quality was wonderful after too many pairs of cheap headphones , but that didn't mean much since they wouldn't stay on my head . NOT adjustable to fit anyone with a smaller head .  
  2700 mAh Ni-MH batteries sounded great , but my old 1600 mAh batteries last 10 times as long . At full charge , these batteries fail after 5-10 photos in my Canon A710IS camera . I 've charged these batteries one day and found them completely dead the next . To be fair , the charger is great ! It has 4 independent intelligent charging circuits , so you can charge 1-4 batteries in different states of charge . Each battery will come to full charge and stop charging . The refresh feature will restore many ' dead ' batteries to some degree of usefullness . Great charger , but you will have to buy or own different batteries .  
  This is my first review of a product ever . I just signed into Amazon in order to warn anyone who might read this . I 've had these speakers for over a year and I 'm not sure I 've ever been more disappointed with a Bose product . Bose really dropped the ball with these speakers , completely cheaping out with the wires used to connect the speakers to the sub . The wires are so poor that it causes one or both of the speakers to short out on occasion .. something that can only be remedied by moving the speaker slightly . I would 100 % avoid these speakers . You can find better for less money .  
  These rollers heat up very fast and if more than 5 mins lapse they are very hot to handle and burn your head a little . Otherwise they work .  
  Widely advertised as the firste PocketPC PDA with integrated 802.11b wireless , the e740 looked like a great opportunity to synch with my PC over my company 's pervasive wireless net . Unfortunately , our IS department hasn't been able to figure it out , and Toshiba technical support won't ( " We don't provide support for active synchronization over a wireless network .. " ) or can't help . The e740 may just have a problem handling VPN , which provides security for the corporate network , but Toshiba support doesn't want to talk about it . Additionally , great expandability in a very thin package is offset by a dim ( compared to iPAQ ) display and an awkward-to-hold rectangular design . There are also some hiccups with ActiveSynch .. still , if I could get a wireless connection at work , I 'd consider it a good investment . Maybe it works for surfing the web at Starbucks , but if you need it to work at the office , make sure that somebody else already has one that works with your wireless network .  
  I purchased a defender security camera system . At exactly 13 months the dvr stopped working . At first Defender refused to do anything about it and said it was out of warranty which ended just a few weeks back . After a couple emails and phone calls they finally said they would fix the broken unit . I thought everything would be fine then it all started . I sent in the unit at my expense . About a month later I receive the unit back and an email saying we refuse to fix your broken unit because it is out of warranty . Defender does not stand behind their products . Why would you say you would fix a broken product then turn around to the paying customer and tell them we refuse to help them ? I called customer support about this and everyone is rude and will not talk to you without say you are out of warranty so we will not help you .  
  I thought for sure these would have some capability . They don't . Apparently their idea of ' active ' noise canceling means to add static and boost the volume on your music . The only thing that I noticed getting canceled was already blocked out through their inner ear design , and at the price of adding static noise to all your music . One may think these work after extended use but only because they are now passively blocking out other noises because of the static that these produce . ' Active ' noise canceling in this situation apparently means noise cover-up technology . At least the ear buds feel comfortable and you get an airplane adapter .. but then I fly cheaply on airlines that don't have entertainment or meals . I 'm glad I only paid $ 10 but they are really only worth $ 5 and even that 's being generous .  
  i bought one of these rewinders . maybe used it 5 times and it just quit working so threw it in the trash because returning it would have cost as much as a new one . so do not buy this item .  
  I don't want to be over critcal , however I would not purchase this mouse again . The reason being , the device will not maintain its connection . It is consistently losing the connection , whether it be the signal or the software I don't know . Then at times it is aggrevating what one has to go through to reconnect . I strongly suggest to anyone thinking of a Bluetooth mouse to do the research before you put down the money , maybe Logitech is not the product .  
  This case it not terrible , but I really would not recommend it . The black design is really boring after a while , and the leather starts to look a bit odd if you just keep it in your bag . The way it flips up can tend to be a bit odd , seeing as it is partially inhibited by the headphone jack . However , if you are just looking for something that will get the job done and is inexpensive , it will function . This product holds the Zune rather securely , and won't allow to buttons to be pressed while closed . Also , it snaps shut pretty tight . However , be careful because a bit of the top near the corners and the botton corners are exposed to everyday wear and tear . Overall , if you want crude protection without an ounce of flare , this is your product .  
  I bought this mouse to replace an aging wireless Microsoft Mouse Optical . It is nicely shaped but it scans poorly . My wife and I have had problems with the cursor jumping several cm up the screen so that we click on unintended objects . Different surfaces do not improve matters , including a high tech mouse pad . I have changed back to my old mouse . This is not the first time I have had a bad experience with Logitech mice , despite what others have written .  
  The Zune software is a nightmare to set up . Once I did , I found out that the Zune does not play all the music I had purchased from online music stores that use Microsoft 's own " Plays for Sure " DRM . Why would Microsoft abadon thier own encryption ? If they think I 'm going to re-buy music from their own store , they 're nuts ! ( I won't even get into Microsoft 's stupid point system for buying music ) Even my own mp3 's , from CD 's I own , also had to be re-encoded and that took for ever . I figured that I would just use the Windows Media Player instead of this lousy Zune software , but guess what ! That won't sync to the Zune either . Didn't Microsoft see what happend to Sony 's " Connect " software . If you have not heard of " Sony Connect " , that 's because they tried to do exactly what Microsoft is doing with the Zune , and nobody used it . The wireless feature is a joke . If you can find someone to send a song to , they can only listen to it 3 times or 3 days , whichever comes first . How is this a feature ? Wireless would have been a good idea if you could actually " share " your music with someone else . More proof that Microsoft does what the record companies want them to do . Wireless also drains the battery in a hurry . Even with the wireless off , the battery life stinks . Another fact I found out , was that Microsoft gives record companies money for every Zune sold , because THEY KNOW all the music on MP3 players are stolen . What about MP3 CD 's that are played on CD players ? I don't know about you , but I 'm not going to support a company that wants to open the flood gates , and pay record and movie companies just because a device can play content the way I want to . This would mean every DVD , CD , VHS , and Tivo players sold would have to give money to the record and movie companies , because THEY KNOW all of these products have stolen content on them . If Microsoft had decent software ( which may be fixed eventually ) and I could use the music I already own on this player , and Microsoft wasn't supporting companies that label me as a thief , I may have considered keeping this thing , but I need something that plays music , not something that annoys the heck out of me . I 'll have to try something else . What a waste of time .  
  I replaced an Airlink 101 ( has 2 antenas ) w / this router . My Airlink got much , much better signal & it was $ 30 something compared to $ 70 something for this . Now it 's too late to send back & stuck w / this junk . Amazon is awsome , of course . Just the product that is junk .  
  After reading the other reviews we bought this burner thinking it was the perfect solution . Unfortunately we were never able to get it to work for us ! The setup of the unit was easy and the software installation was simple but when we tried to use it to record something .. nothing . The EZ-Dub drive would recognize and play Audio CD 's and DVD 's but , the start buttons on the top of the unit that is supposed to initiate the two record functions were completely inoperative . We tried everything . We tried Uninstalling the software and reinstalling it several times , we did every troubleshooting point given to us by the help files , we checked all the drivers on both ports and still nothing . We then went to the technical support from the manufacturer at the provided 1-800 number .. guess what .. I'ts no longer active and the 1-800 is no more . Now you have to dial their long distance number and only during weekdays working hours . Very frustrating . What we did then was go onto the live " online chat " with the tech support guys in an effort to get this problem solved . After about 1.5 hours the tech support people were stumped and gave up as well . Needless to say we were not impressed by them or their product . It has be returned for refund .  
  We had been very happy with this camcorder - until we pulled it out to take Christmas pictures of our 15-month old son and the camcorder wouldn't record . It wouldn't eject the tape , and after repeated calls to customer service , we 've been told that they 'll pay for parts , but the labor to fix it is just over $ 200 . Unfortunately even though we 've only used the camcorder for under 15 hours , we 're outside the 90 days for labor warranty ( who 'd have thought the camcorder would be unusable after under 15 hours of use ? ) . Still waiting on a callback from customer service , but having gone up 4 levels already , it 's not looking like they 'll fix the product . Think our model will be headed for the trash - and we 'll be looking at anything BUT Sony for future purchases . I would definitely steer clear of a Sony after this experience .  
  The cable has been carrying the signal fine . But after eight months , the insulation covering is falling apart in multiples places and looks like it will soon fall off the entire length of cable .  
  Too few buttons . If you need to replace remotes with lots of buttons , this remote is utterly useless . It will lump all the functions without dedicated buttons to the LCD screen and you 'll have to scroll through them . The LCD menu will only display a few characters , so you 'll have to guess what the LCD key stands for . Only 3 activity buttons , if you have more devices , this means you 'll have to scroll through the device buttons . This remote is going to the drawer for me . Not easy to program , this is from a software engineer . My old Sony RM-VL900 is much , much , better . If you have remotes with lots of buttons and if you have more than 3 devices you want to control , this remote is not for you . It 's way over rated .  
  They squeeze and pinch your head and hardly have any volume at all . Dont work as well as my partially shorted out similar Sony 's . Dont believe the other reviews . They are worthless .  
  The picture showed that this is a brand new , sealed item - IT IS NOT ! It is NOT SEALED , so how do I know if it 's used and been reformatted ? Or if it 's corrupt ? VERY MISLEADING !  
  I have the Linksys Cable / DSL router , which is an excellent product . I expected similar from their Wireless Access Point , but so far , I 've been pretty disappointed . The setup was OK , but not nearly as nice as the web-based configuration on the Cable / DSL router . ( PC Magazine actually praised their setup routine , so take my comments as you will . ) In terms of range , I was VERY disappointed . I got good performance , until I moved my computer more than five or six feet from the box . I tried changing channels , repositioning the antennas , etc . , but didn't have much better luck . ( For reference , I was using Linksys ' wireless PCMCIA card . ) .. I am going to play around a little bit more , but so far , I 'm not too impressed .  
  The left speaker stopped working after 3 months . Get anything that isn't Labtec . Big waste of money .  
  Yeah .. this product did not work with my computer . I installed the program from the TI website , tried plugging in the calculator to the computer , and it said it was incompatible with my OS . ( XP ) :( It 's a pity because I really would have liked to be able to update my calculator via computer .  
  There are a lot of good reviews , so it is quite possible I simply got a bad pair . I tested it out in three places . Next to a garbage disposal , near a noisy fan , and next to a lawn mower ( I have been on planes that sound like our lawn mower ) . The noise cancellation did almost nothing . Switching on and off did make it sound a little different , but otherwise did nothing . So I went back to using earbuds under plain ear protection ( ear muffs ) . I added a star , since the return was an easy process .  
  I just received and immediately sent back my Onkyo TX-8222 receiver . I connected everything , plugged it in , and turned it on . After two seconds , it turned off . When I turned it on again , it crackeled and popped , then shut off . I went through this scenario about a dozen times . I called the Onkyo support line and waited on hold over 45 minutes before hanging up . In the troubleshooting section of the manual , it instructs the user to unplug the unit for an hour , then try again , when this happens . I did this twice , but the unit still would not remain on . I will try another brand .  
  At a cursory , window-shopping level the Casio E-100 shines with its color screen , easy touch pad , and smart initial layout , but once you use it you realize it suffers functionally versus the Palms . It is too bulky for your pocket or even a jacket . The power switch is awkward to use . The power runs out quickly and needs to be recharged , so if you travel internationally it can't simply be plugged in whereas the Palm uses AA battries that can be gotten anywhere . Despite being CE based it doesn't sync up with Outlook any better than the Palm . It has much less flexibility with capturing addresses and data which with the Palm can be better customized . Stay with the Palms , because Amazon will not take it back after 30 days if you don't like it ,  
  The battery are getting hot after charged . It is not used often . Battery life is definitely short after 1.5yrs ( they claim this is NiMH ) . I bought Energizxx , more reliable and energy . Don't waste money in this .  
  The detailed product description says type M. The product photo and brief description looks like type H. Other fuji cards listed on amazon say high-speed but not explicitly type H. Some reviews for other " type H " cards state that you 're actually purchasing a type M card . I 'm hesitant to purchase any xD card from one of amazons 3rd party retailers . What kind of card is this ?  
  I recently purchased this camera . It takes great pictures ; however , I turned it off one night and then when I turned it back on it said card locked . I can not get it to work now . I was wondering if anyone new how to fix that ?  
  Mine didn't last more than 8 months . I 'm buying a different brand today to try that out . Wouldn't recommend this one . It worked great at first , but then it would cut in and out , misread some of songs ( skipping ) , etc .  
  I was very disapointed in the FM Antenna . I have not been able to pick up any radio station with this product .  
  Unfortunately I had the receiver and camera set that goes with this so I ended up buy this second camera . They are all poorly made , and don't last . SVAT customer service is a joke .  
  dont even think of buying this . it looks really good but after you get it youll see that it 's really hard to put video in it because it only reads mpeg-4 . it cant record nor does it have radio . it barely has any cool options and special things you can do with it . anyway if you buy this youll see you made a mistake . if you want an mp3 player with video than i recommend the creative zen vision : m because it rocks and beats this thing by much . you should go to the page and take a look at it . you will see that im not the only one who thinks like me . hope you enjoy and take my advise .  
  I 've only had these speakers for 6 months and the subwoofer has already stopped working . These speakers are cheap but they are also flimsy and have poor workmanship . Spend the few extra bucks and get something better .  
  [ .. ] I have 3 desktop PCs and one or 2 laptops in my home WEP WiFi network , and only one HP6540 printer . Seemed like the ideal solution . Setting it up was no problem whatsoever . Got it to print the Windows test page first time , and was quite pleased with myself . There the fun ended .. I have found that :* I need to keep it switched off , and only turn it on when I need to print something . If I leave it switched on , the next time I turn on a PC and try to print , I get the old " Print Server connect failure " message , and it needs a reboot . * When it decides to print , it will print large or small documents quickly if , and only if the print queue is already completely empty . Every time I print something , it leaves a couple of KB worth of the print job in the queue , with status " Printing " . This stays there for about 5 mins , and I can't even delete it . If I try , Windows just says " Deleting " for 5 mins . * When I tried to do a firmware upgrade off their website to see if it would fix the above , it toasted the Flash memory in the print server , and I had to send it back to Mot at my expense for an exchange . * Gets exceedigly hot if left switched on in the summer . * Sometimes things get really screwed up . My 7 year old daughter tried printing one of her creations and unbeknownst to me kept getting the " Print Server connect failure " message , so she kept hitting print . Even after rebooting PC , printer and print server , one of the three somehow remembered all those print jobs and started spewing them out . Could I stop it ? I could not .  
  i had the same problem as the previous reviewer . after 2 weeks of fine playback , the player suddenly wouldn't play my dvd 's . i also couldn't eject the disc unless i turned it off , then turned it on . ended up returning the player since it was within the 30 days . i also had the same problem with the samsung 841 player . i own a sony 60xbr950 . i 've heard about problems with dvi connections ? i had to go with a hdmi / dvi monster cable . maybe a hdmi / hdmi connection might be alright . i own all sony products , and this is the first time i was not satisfied with a sony . the picture was great while it was working .. but to be honest , the picture with my sony rdrhx900 recorder / player ( component video ) is just as good . i 'll stick with the component video till they work out the bugs with the dvi connections .  
  Happened to me , too . Had to return it . :(  
  This product does not work , and the poorly written documents and difficult-to-use software do not help . I tried everything , from upgrading the printer driver ( to the latest XP-compatible version ) , to differnt length USB cables , to no avail . Avoid this turkey .  
  Send me a generic / universal car kit instead of real car kit and off course it did not work no contact # for customer service on their website . Goods arrived late . WORST POSSIBLE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE will not recommend to anybody  
  I am a medical transcriptionist . Often I have to hit the keys ( hard ) because a letter doesn't type or the space bar fails to work the first time . It is a nice keyboard for someone who doesn't type very much but now I am faced with buying a new ( and most likely more expensive ) keyboard that has a better touch and response time . In the space of several hours this gets VERY annoying and it makes me want to scream .  
  This is at best a built in flash substitute but it even fails at that since the built in flash in D80 , D90 , D200 , D300 , D700 etc . can be used for the built in commander mode which this doesn't . Speaking of commander mode , you can't use this as a remote flash . You also don't get an LCD screen on this model so there is no flash compensation . Power is lacking , and you can't bounce this the way you can with the higher end models . Save up and at least get an SB-600 .  
  I purchased this router to replace a Belkin N + which had drop out issues . This D-Link worked fine for a couple of months and now it too has developed drop outs . I have to reboot it about once a week and a couple of times I had to reboot it multiple times in order to get it functioning . The router has great features and a fair range but I need uninterrupted service . Another thing I dislike about this router is that I have not been able to control it remotely . I travel some and have network cameras using the router but I can not access it remotely to make changes ; this is not a deal breaker but it would be nice .  
  Sony 's XBR line of LCD displays are near or at the top of the most amazing on the market in terms of picture quality , but anyone considering a purchase of an XBR2/3 model display should be aware that there is a significant manufacturing defect with displays produced post-August of 2006 that results in extremely splotchy or " cloudy " backlighting . During playback of dark content , clouds of bright spots can be seen across the display . Sony has yet to officially acknowledge this latest stumble in their production quality control , but do a search for " XBR clouding " and you will find plenty of discussion about this very real problem . I have personally owned this display and the defect was significant enough to warrant a return . I opted not to get a replacement knowing that so many of these displays in the channel are affected . When ( hopefully not " if " ) Sony is able to remedy the production problem and get non-defective sets to retail , I would easily rate it a five-star product and re-purchase one for my home theater .  
  I am not a photgrapher .. I bought this for my wife . But it turns out that this item only supports a VERY small subset of Pentax lenses . Otherwise , it is useless , So I returned it and picked a different teleconverterPro-Optic Multi-Coated 2x Tele-Converter for Pentax Autofocus SLR Cameras - Made in JapanIt was much less expensive than the one that did not work , and has made my wife happy to have it . On the good side , I found Amazon 's return process to be fair , effcient and speedy . Thank you Amazon  
  Rio seems to be getting out of the MP3 player business . Like many others my volume dial broke in 6 months ( 3 mos past the VERY short warranty ) so Rio would only offer me $ 99 for another from their remaining inventory . They aren't making any more and to the best my knowledge are getting out of the MP3 business altogether . I also agree with some of the other cons : short battery life and poor recording quality .  
  Too bad for me that the warranty expires after six ! The product has a defect that tech support admitted to , but I got absolutely no help , mercy or customer service from the Panasonic company . They demanded one third of its original price for me to send it to Texas to have it fixed ! After YEARS of buying Panasonic products , they just lost another customer .  
  I bought this system from another store . I 'm so sorry I did . The cordless is barely usable because of the terrible feedback you get when you 're on it . You can hear everything else around you better when you 're on the phone accept the person that is calling you . The telephone with caller ID and answering system is okay , but that too has feedback and the person calling you has a hard time hearing you unless you shout into it . What a bad investment . I thought I was getting a good product when I saw AT & T on the box . I was wrong . Please if you 're considering a phone , don't buy this product . You 'll be sorry you did .  
  I ( like many others I found out ) made the mistake of buying a Koss CDR200 . I did not use the unit much initially . When I started to use it the CDRW disc locked up in the B drive . I called Koss ( a faceless company - must be a pure importer ) and they said unplug the unit and plug it back in . It worked - that time . The second time it happened unplug-plug did not work . I called Koss and they said " sorry , unit discontinued , no replacement " . Call this screw the customer . No place to repair it . No service information . No replacement unit available . I don't know how they get away with this as I thought all electronic products sold in the US were supposed to have some kind of parts and service availability for a certain number of years by law . I will never buy another Koss product and I will disparage their name anytime it comes up . Any outfit that can't even suggest where their product can be repaired ( and this is only to release a disc from the tray ) ought to be put out of business .  
  My Lite-On drive meets the required specifications for using these discs , but none of the discs are recognized . I even flashed my drive with updated firmware , but it still will not read or burn these discs .  
  Why buy a Dell DJ when you can buy a ipod . An ipod is a sleek cool device and its popular . Do u see people or kids walking aroung with a dell dj ? NO ! you mostly find someone having a ipod . PLus ! ipod has itunes to go with it . If you ask me i think dell should stink with its comp and printers . NOT MADE FOR MP3 PLAYERS !  
  Unfortunately I had a very bad consumer experience buying this camera . I had borrowed a ZR20 from a friend the year before and liked it , so when the ZR40 came out I wanted to buy it . I read online that some people were complaining about motor noise with this camera , but I figured I try it anyways . I bought it at Best Buy ( should be called Worst Buy ) , and when trying it out found that it does have super bad motor noise . You can't hear it while recording - it 's when you are watching a tape you recorded playback on your TV etc that you hear it . The motor noise is recorded in with your audio , so you hear a loud humm in the background . It was too loud for me to live with . If I was recording something with no background noise ( like my baby playing ) , then it was as loud as his voice ! .. I have now ordered the Panasonic PVDC152 which is supposed to have good sound . We 'll see ..  
  This is the second Zune we bought . The first one had a cracked screen and the second one does not work . In fact , we are about to send it back and request a refund for the purchase .  
  Camera takes good photos but flash takes to long to recycle if your taking a lot of flash photo it is poor .. due to recycle time ..  
  DO NO BUY THIS if you do NOT have touch tone dialing . You will not be able to fax out . Why is this not stated in the Product / Technical features ? I cannot use this machine and got Zero satisfaction from Brother and Amazon . Watch out what you buy !  
  These headphones are the worst . The only redeeming quality is that they retract . Otherwise , the cord is super thin , very short , and the sound quality is terrible ! Also , they broke apart very soon after I got them just from being in my purse . Don't waste your money .  
  I bought this hands-free Panasonic handset to use with a new Panasonic phone so I can keep my hands free to type editorial changes my clients want to make . Problem is that I can't hear them very well , even with the volume set to max on the phone itself . As far as I 'm concerned , this headset is totally useless .  
  I purchased this MP3 player instead of an IPod and I really regret it . The buttons on it are very hard to press and they usually do not even work . It will get stuck on the radio and unable to switch back to the MP3 's . Or , it will start scanning the radio for stations and you won't be able to stop . I highly recommend spending the extra $ 100 for an IPod  
  I HATE this camera , and have had nothing but problems with it since it was given to me as a mother 's day gift in May , 2007 . I have sent it in for service ( what a frustrating two weeks ! ) and after getting it back-allegedly fixed - I opened the box , and the batteries I had put in just prior to sending it for service were not working . I put in two more brand new batteries and one day later , yesterday , I power it on and get the " low battery " message . The lag time between pushing the button and the actual picture snap is infuriating , and the service provided by Samsung was abominable . I will never purchase another Samsung item ! I am beyond frustrated - the camera 's shortcomings were exacerbated by the complete lack of service provided by Samsung ' so-called " service " center . I was unable to reach anyone in a position of authority , and the phone rep actually refused to let me speak to a supervisor , and refused to give me a supervisor 's name . DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA , and DO NOT GIVE THIS unresponsive company your business !  
  I purchased a Nitrus in August and I LOVED it . It was easy to add or remove music and it played really well , but only days after my 90 day warranty was up , my Nitrus went into " upgrade mode " and froze there . I could not reset the player , nor would a firmware update install . I called tech support and spoke to several incompetent people , none of which knew how to help me , and they all told me I was out of luck because my 90 day warranty was up , even though it was only up by 3-5 days . I never mishandeled or mistreated the player in any way , and I was listening to it as normal when it malfunctioned . I have friends that have had problems with Rio products and have read other reviews that state situations similar to mine , and I have concluded that Rio does not make a quality product . Please save the money and buy a better quality player .  
  i bought this dvd recorder on 121705 , and now , it will not write any dvd 's i buy .. don't buy it .. it is a waste of money !  
  I have been through three of these . It works for a few months then displays " Upgrader " on the display and will not restart . India tech support is useless .  
  I was disappointed in this product . I purchased it to replace an older headset that I have had for years and was wearing out . When I first used this I noticed the sound volume and quality were much worse than I was used to . People I was meeting with via conference call said they could not hear me very well , which has never been a problem before . I am going back to my original one .  
  I have a Canon Pixma MP470 . After I installed the ink cartridge it began to leak and caused a lot of problems . I won't be purchasing this again .  
  I ordered a 64meg smartmedia card and got SD instead . I can get a sd card 2 gig for 9.99 shipped free , what and the heck am I going to do with a 64meg sd for 15.57 ! Rip off !  
  This is your typical over educated , book learned , marketing directed , lack of common sense , poorly designed product . Every person at Canon involved with this ergonomic faux pas should be condemned to have to use it as their only document producer for a solid year . Did the magazine reviewers , who gushed all over this unit , actually use this machine in a true business setting ? I 'm suspicious on this one too . Sure there are some nice features on this unit . But realistically , how often do you use them . I need a multifunction set up , not some over marketed ersatz photo print shop . For starters , the biggest aggravation is the copying design . Did any of the designer / engineers / marketing types actually sit down and work with unit . I think not . Otherwise they would have placed the controls in a user friendly location . There have been times when copying from a catalogue or text book has become a two person job . One , who has to use two hands , to hold the book securely on the glass , while the other person has to lift the other half of the book , then kneel down to get to eye level so they can find the controls and start the copying process . There isn't another option , cause you can't , or at least I haven't found out how to , remove the document cover , so the book can be turned the other way . Turn the machine off and you have to reset your menu 's . BTW , has anyone tried to locate the on / off button on this unit ? After I had this about two months I had to consult the user 's manual to find it , because it wasn't in the obvious place , on the side or behind the unit . In fact I still can't tell you where the on / off switch is . Why didn't the designers ? , of this machine make the default what most offices use : 8 x 11 , black , and fast print . I mean how often does anyone print 4 x 6 photos , for crying-out-loud ? So why have this as the start up default ? Here 's why ! Marketing emails engineering , our market research sez the customer wants photo printing options . Accounting emails engineering , our numbers indicate that photo printing uses ink faster and we increase profits , cause colored ink has higher margins , in addition we charge more for photo specialty paper , and that means you guys get a bigger bonus . So engineering sees the picture : photo printing is the default . If you happen to hit the wrong button , and I don't know which one , ' cause it happened so fast , ( I was struggling unassisted to copy from a book this time ) the unit defaulted back to high quality 4 x 6 photo copying . This is a real draag . Because what ever you are copying will be reproduced in s l o w m o t i o n . So you wait and wait and wait , while the image reader , achingly , slowly , makes it first pass across the document , Then you wait , achingly , slowly again , while it makes it second pass for the optical reader to read the image . Finally the print head starts to achingly , slowly print the image . By this time your wondering WHAT-THE-H * LL IS GOING ON ? F i n a l l y , I 'll repeat , f i n a l l y , the page with the image starts to appear with your partial high resolution 4 x 6 image on your 8 x 11 plain paper . That whole process took about 3 or 4 minutes . Have you ever had a customer standing around for 3 or 4 minutes while you try to explain why you don't know what 's happening with the copier . You 'll be saying WHAT-THE-H * LL IS GOING ON to yourself , tooAnother design / engineering oversight , why does the optical reader have to make two passes when ever it starts reading . First it makes a complete pass with out being illuminated , then it makes an illuminated , I suppose its reading characters , pass ? More time , achingly , slowly , waiting for the copying to start . But now for the upside , once the two passes are made this unit will churn out the image and finished product fast . That , so far , is it 's only redeeming quality . I bought this unit because of the new print head technology and the use of individual ink cartridges and the strong reviews from the industry rags . If I had known it was going to be so damm user UNFRIENDLY I would have researched further and bought from a manufacturer who understands their customers needs . Canon you need to have your engineers / designers / marketer 's use the machine in everyday situations . Having a great looking , beautifully designed office tool that 's defaulted towards the God knows what market , just doesn't cut it when it comes to the everyday real work world . 08.06.2011 UPDATE : Yesterday , having one bad day , and trying to use this AIO for some scanning of a book . Out of Cyan ink . Entire unit goes into freeze mode . I 'm not printing , I 'm scanning and I can't use it . I sat and looked at the unit and thought to myself , I 've put up with the POS for the last time . I picked it up and slammed it to the floor , smashed it into major parts . Gathered it up and took it to the dumpster . It was the most satisfying moment I had in my ownership of this printer . I am downgrading my comments to a 1 .  
  I bought this cable from SF Planet , and they shipped the same HDMI cable that they are selling for 27 cents . The cable does not look like the one pictured here . It works fine , but why pay 6-times more for the same cable ?  
  If you have a HP Pavilion 8660c , do not buy this item . Even after help from HP tech support , they could not make it work . The problem is that the motherboard has onboard graphics that cannot be disabled in the BIOS . The Radeon card will not be picked up by the PC after you put it in . ATI support told me on the phone to buy another graphic card !  
  I wanted a regular palm pilot to keep addresses and appts . The one I was sent had no way to connect to my computer for backup . I will not use this and will send it back this week . I don't need email or internet on a simple digital PDA .
